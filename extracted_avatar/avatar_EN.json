            "Good Evening\t*sigh* It's gotten quiet outside...",
            "Good Night\tGood night, you go ahead and rest. I will just finish one last experiment before bed... If you are interested in the results, I can discuss them with you tomorrow.",
            "About Albedo: Genius\tGenius? ...A number of people call me that. But I don't think I'm any \"genius.\"",
            "About Albedo: Socializing\tRelationships are... *sigh* quite troublesome. Once you establish a relation with someone, you must continue to maintain it; if you lose contact, you must reestablish the relation. This taxing cycle requires...a lot of time.",
            "About Us: Experiments\tYou... want to accompany me while I experiment? I'm honored.\nOh, don't be nervous. My experiments may be dangerous, but no one gets hurt... most of the time.",
            "About Us: Assistant\tWould you oblige me by serving as my assistant? After observing so many experiments, you surely know a good deal about alchemy by now. Relax, we will work together. I don't think you will have any problems. I have faith in my ability to instruct you, and even more faith in your exceptional talents.",
            "About the Vision\tMy Vision? Ah, that's nothing more than a tool to aid in my experiments, no different from a beaker or crucible. The one thing about it that really intrigues me is the principle behind how it works... One day, I will uncover its secrets. It's only a matter of time.",

            "Interesting Things\tYou would like to know more about petrified trees? Um... ahem. Actually, the petrified trees you have come across in domains aren't that ancient. Truly ancient trees usually grow to around one or two miles in height? Oh, and there's a kind of large spider that lives around their roots — if you tie one up in cape jasmine and lemongrass and sprinkle on some cardamom, smoke it for a few hours — you get a fragrant taste that's simply... unforgettable.",
            "About Family\tFamily? Although Alice has always asked me to call her \"Mother,\" when I think of the idea of \"family,\" my master comes to mind first. My earliest memories in life are of going on adventures with her. She taught me the art of alchemy and much knowledge about the world. Perhaps... even the words \"family\" and \"master\" are incapable of fully expressing her meaning to me.",

For example, I have told her numerous times to just call me \"Albedo\" since we are hardly generations apart, but she insists on addressing me in an excessively formal manner. *sigh* ...Whatever she prefers, I guess.",

            "About Jean\tJean? She has served exceptionally well as Acting Grand Master. One can even say she is more reliable than Grand Master Varka. Perhaps in our hearts, we all eagerly await the day she can become the official Grand Master herself.",
            "About Xingqiu\tOh, Xingqiu? I find his written works quite interesting. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has been asking that I cooperate with a different author for greater royalties. Hmph, do I seem the type to be swayed by a few extra Mora?",
            "About Barbara\tBarbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... Albert offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort.",

            "More About Albedo: II\tOh, by the way. Did you know that without human manipulation, you would need to harness the power of a sun eight times the size of our own in order to naturally create gold?",
            "More About Albedo: III\tThe time required to sketch portraits closely correlates with one's mood. I could spend half a day sketching Huffman, while I might only need three strokes of the pencil to sketch Kaeya — one for the face, one for the eyepatch string... and one for the eyepatch.",
            "More About Albedo: IV\tWhat do I do besides sketching and research...? I will occasionally read novels from Inazuma and Liyue. They contain many fascinating ideas which can sometimes provide me with unexpected inspirations for my own creations.",
            "More About Albedo: V\tEven now, I find the nigredo processing stage of alchemy passed down by my master to be full of mystery. What did my master want to create using this technique...? My research is far from over. I will require your help to investigate further.",
            "Albedo's Hobbies\tHmm... Besides research, the activity I spend most of my time on is probably sketching. At first I saw it simply as a way to better study the structure of living things and materials so as to aid me in my experiments, but it eventually became a hobby of mine. Indeed, it is a very good way to relax.",

            "Favorite Food\tI really do enjoy having dessert. How can I put it...? When both physical and mental capacity are spent, high-energy materials further provide a kind of primordial, highly-effective boost.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tWhat food do I dislike? ...Large portions of meat at restaurants. I have a rather small appetite, so a meal like that only ends up in tragedy — either I overeat and the joy of the taste is lost, or I don't finish it and the food is wasted. I decided to simply not go to restaurants, although that has also meant I must spend more time preparing my own food...",

            "Birthday\tHappy birthday. You look especially happy, would you mind if I sketched you? The capacity of our brains is limited, so we are bound to forget things. But when an image is transferred onto paper or canvas, the sketch becomes an extension of our memory. We can remember that past feeling when we later look at the sketch.",

            "Character Details\tAlchemy is an ancient art, and many of its secrets have been lost to history. The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue.\n\"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!\" Or so most alchemists would protest.\nBut as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy.\nAt least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.\nThis young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Akademiya did not possess.\n\"The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life.\"\nAs if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.\nSeconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand.\n\"And this... is new life.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tAlbedo has a very important job within the Knights of Favonius but does not often appear in public.\nStill, he does not have the strange and eccentric temper that people tend to assume of academics. In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings.\nHe is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm.\nAs a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance.\nOn days when he shuts himself away in his laboratory to focus on his work, or heads out into the wild to gather materials, no one in Mondstadt will be able to find him.\nYet Albedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person.\nHe delights in giving guidance to his assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose.\nHe finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt.\nYet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that Lisa, for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Albedo got into Mondstadt because of his master's recommendation letter.\"\nThis statement is technically true. But Monstadt's gates are open to everyone, and he would have been quite welcome even without the recommendation letter.\nIn fact, Albedo's life in Mondstadt may even have been more comfortable without it.\nThis is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer, Alice, an old friend of Albedo's master, Rhinedottir.\nAfter receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests.\n\"So, Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!\"\nAnd just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.\nThe work of the Knights was actually quite easy for Albedo, requiring only five percent of his energy.\nThe rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal, he thought.\nAnd yet...\nAlice has a daughter, named Klee.\nYes, \"that\" Klee.\n\"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!\"\nFrom that day forth, cleaning up after Klee would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy...",
            "Character Story 3\tAlbedo has no memory of any blood relations. From as far back as he can remember, he was already adventuring deep within domains with his master.\nOf course, Miss Alice, the Knights of Favonius, and that traveler who had a sense of the stellar depths about them... They are all important people. And yet his master is unquestionably the most special to him.\nFor Albedo, she is his only kin.\nShe was a cold and strict woman who raised him and taught him the secrets of alchemy.\n\"The universe is the sable essence of the true starry sky... Earth is the accumulated memory of time and being...\nChalk: that is you. Soil is where alchemy derives its name, and is the basis of all life. And this...\"\nShe demonstrated her technique before him as a huge life form burst from its culture tank in a shower of shattered fragments.\n\"...This is new birth.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tAlbedo once led a simple and content existence.\nThere was no need for him to contemplate anything. Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.\nBut one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.\nAnd with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.\nUpon the note was written: \"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\"\nThe classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.\nIf one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.\nIn the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.\nHe had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.\nBut this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.\nDid this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?\n\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe alchemy that Albedo commands is wholly different from any of the arts practiced in the Seven Nations of Teyvat.\nIts lineage can be traced back to the nation of Khaenri'ah.\nKhaenri'ah was an underground realm, with precious few natural fauna. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.\nThis art of creation was known as \"The Art of Khemia.\"\nAlbedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes.\n The next stage after \"soil\" is \"chalk,\" which was also something his master had mentioned.\n\"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man.\"\nNow, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive.\n\"From soil was birthed chalk.\"\nThe profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.\nSuch ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.\nShe was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her.\n\"I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?\"\nFrom time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment.",
            "Albedo's Artwork\tAlbedo's interest in drawing and painting began back in the days of traveling with his master.\nAt first, he would simply illustrate his notes with basic sketches. But he soon noticed that the process of rendering things in great detail helped him to intimately understand their physical makeup, which was of great utility to his alchemical studies.\nAdditionally, it also allowed him to enter into a pleasant state of clarity, in which he needed only to focus on observation and creating his artwork, and nothing else.\nEventually, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal tuition.\nWhen strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys sketching and painting all manner of living things, but particularly people in moments of joy.\nSometimes, he even gifts his artwork to his unsuspecting models, believing that when a work of art captures a transient moment of enjoyment, it is something worth treasuring.\nAlbedo continued to refine his skills in this manner, going from strength to strength — until one day, when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma.\nHow was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power?\nAmazed, he decided to give it a go himself.\n...Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, \"A Legend of Sword\" was printed and published.\nUnfortunately, it received lukewarm reviews, being lambasted as \"a dictionary with divine illustrations.\"",
            "Vision\tGaining a Vision came as no great surprise to Albedo.\nWhen he received it, he gave it a single glance before continuing to engross himself in his work.\nHe barely felt any wave of emotion at all, as if this was something to be taken for granted.\nAs far as he is concerned, his Vision is merely a tool with which he can more conveniently conduct his research.\nWhat truly sparks joy within him is turning the unknown into the known.\nOne day, he will understand all there is to know about this world — and Visions are no exception."

            "Character Details\tA capable person who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Alhaitham himself is a powerful rebuttal to all these cliché views: He is a brilliant man, but he is only an ordinary employee of the Akademiya, with a stable job and a cushy house in Sumeru, leading a carefree and comfortable life.\nSometimes, people find it next to impossible to catch the current scribe in his office. Little do they know about the scribe, other than his name, \"Alhaitham,\" and that he is supposed to be present during work hours. The fact is, no one knows his whereabouts, and all they can do is leave documents and files on his desk.\nAlhaitham couldn't be more satisfied with how things are. The man might be at home or in the library, but he'll never appear where people wish him to be.\nHaving an entirely unpredictable schedule affords undisturbed freedom.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe title of a \"scribe\" may sound impressive to most Akademiya students, but this fancy name is just a product of the Akademiya's culture to use unnecessarily high-flown titles.\nIn truth, the scribe does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The scribe is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents. However, in Sumeru, where books and manuscript documents were once managed as a resource, the scribe is one of the most \"in-the-know\" people in the entire Akademiya. One can say that this position is rather similar to that of the Grand Conservator — after all, the person who manages texts will have privileged access to profound wisdom.\nAs the current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya, Alhaitham acts in perfect compliance with his role: He does not attend any non-essential meetings, and when he is required to be present, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. If the meeting does not affect his personal interests or fails to pique his curiosity, he will not be bothered to give any comments. He does make comments, however, when someone has come up with something offensively foolish — and one should expect these comments to be more blunt than necessary.\nSuch is Alhaitham's life philosophy: Whenever the need for his judgment arises, one must be ready to accept any means and privileges he might require to make that judgment. Fortunately for everyone, Alhaitham notes that he is too lazy to possess too many ambitions.\nAll scholars seek knowledge and the truth. Some do so for fame, while others, for ambition. And some others enjoy conquering knowledge and the truth, transcending them, and savoring the sense of superiority in the process. Alhaitham isn't any one of them. He is only driven by what intrigues him. He believes that many scholars have already become lost in their pursuits, taking the truth as a tool or even a shortcut to self-realization.\nHowever, whether one seeks it or not, the truth is always there, hanging high above the sky like an illuminating star. It is not the end of a trip or the destination of a match. It is and shall remain constant, regardless of human existence. Also, human pursuits will not simply end after certain knowledge has been acquired — though people never doubt that they can claim the fruit with joy and are prepared to sacrifice everything for it, their desire for knowledge will keep them going.\nThose who fail to see through the truth set themselves on an endless path, while those with clear minds will say: The truth did not come into being to serve anyone, and whoever is unable to harness their desire for knowledge will be destroyed by it. Such is the rule of the Nation of Wisdom. Of course, if you want to blend in, you are welcome to fake such a posture.",
            "Character Story 2\tTo the people of Sumeru, those who played a part in the operation to save Lesser Lord Kusanali are deemed to be heroes. However, a great many who make such compliments don't really know the full story. They simply repeat a fragment of a tale that they find inspiring. As one of the protagonists in their stories, Alhaitham has no opinion whatsoever about being a \"hero,\" nor does he believe that these stories are worth talking about.\nMeanwhile, Alhaitham has declined the Akademiya's offer to become the Grand Sage multiple times. But given the chaos in Sumeru, Alhaitham eventually agreed to serve as Acting Grand Sage temporarily.\nIt already defied common logic for someone to refuse the titles of Sage and Grand Sage, and yet Alhaitham went further still, resigning and returning to his humble role as Scribe at the agreed-upon time instead of clinging to power.\nIf he did manage to gain anything from it at all, it was the financial benefits: His salary stayed the same after his resignation, not to mention the several high-quality research projects that he was able to complete on his own. There is no doubt, then, that he will lead a well-off life. In addition, his interpersonal relationships have also improved, as he has more or less befriended the other participants in the archon-saving operation — they have gotten close to the point where Alhaitham might greet these people with a nod or two when he sees them.\nSometimes, Lesser Lord Kusanali will also invite Alhaitham to the Sanctuary of Surasthana to discuss various matters. He has met many people there: the General Mahamatra Cyno, the mercenary Dehya, and Nilou, star of the Zubayr Theater. Nilou even once asked him: \"How did you manage to come up with such a bold plan? When I think back on it, we were all quite lucky to not get hurt...\"\nNilou hesitated before she continued, and Alhaitham understood her confusion, for anyone would have wondered how he could have stayed unscathed despite the influence of the Divine Knowledge Capsule. But in Alhaitham's eyes, he was never in danger, for he had never used any capsules.\nAs for how he had managed to do that, it was all thanks to his role as the scribe. As a scholar lucky enough to have read the Akasha's system manual, he had studied the headset and Canned Knowledge, such that he knew how to alter the status signal of the Akasha. He had even once thought of reversing the holographic shield of the Akasha Terminal and projecting it to the back of his head to offer protection from attacks on that front.\nIt has been proven that a plan lays the foundation for everything, and that prior research lays the foundation for a plan. Alhaitham, who had no interest in boasting about how he remained unscathed, answered Nilou's question with another: \"As far as I know, Cyno and Dehya are also curious about this, yet you are the only one who has raised this question. Were they just too shy to ask me themselves?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tAlhaitham seldom discusses personalities or dispositions with others. He believes that the prevalent theories about them are wrong. Suppose someone insists that one's character has nothing to do with their abilities and opinions, the person with such a view will find themselves unable to judge any aspect of another person. A smart person will often hold different attitudes towards a foolish person and another smart person, and the foolish often think differently when facing success and failure. People's views on Alhaitham are proof of this point — given his superb talents and egocentric personality, no one wants to get too close to him, but still, they see him as an outstanding scholar.\nThis is exactly the public image Alhaitham desires. Many scholars are rigid and inflexible, but Alhaitham is not one of them. As a matter of fact, his occasional sarcasm in part reflects his philosophy. Society (or the collective) relies on rules to regulate individuals, and language is one of these regulative tools. Turning language against its original design serves to challenge unreasonable rules, and one can thus stay out of trouble.\nThe word \"talented\" is abused within the Akademiya, and so are \"born differently,\" \"touched by the archon,\" and such... In Sumeru, one's talents are a trial. Outstanding talent is not necessarily seen as a perfect gift, but it also divides people. For instance, to compliment someone with unimaginable achievements, ordinary folk often call them a \"genius,\" or \"superhuman,\" or a \"prodigy\"... But upon reflection, one will soon notice another layer of meaning that even the speakers themselves have not realized: That the talented and the ordinary are categorically different.\nIf someone is capable of things that others aren't, they must have been endowed with some special abilities and gifts. Excessive compliments for and wild imagination regarding outstanding people only serve to alienate them. \"They are successful because they are different\" — such is the typical excuse favored by underachievers. These ignorant notions mean nothing to Alhaitham. Though he does know his way around people, he will not waste his time on such trivial matters.\nRules define borders and set limits. Yet these rules should not be judged solely on the number of people they limit. Therefore, Alhaitham has come up with his own set of rules with which he perceives everything and challenges the world. It is the crystallization of his philosophy. To maintain these rules of his own fashioning, Alhaitham acts on his own will and deals with anything that appears harmful in his eyes.\nOnly with objective judgment can one see the truth. By acknowledging the differences between individuals and recognizing differing levels of capabilities and mental capacities, one will discover the answer right away: Judgment from others is inconsequential, but to leave the right of judgment in others' hands is equal to denying oneself. To be \"different\" should not simply be a label given to you by others. Rather, the talented should have long understood that their uniqueness is also a gift.\nTo put it another way, when a talented person truly understands that they are different and that they are indisputably ingenious, only then can they truly understand the value of their abilities. And as for cowards who remain blinded by perspectives advocated by the great majority, they have not yet found their true selves.",
            "Character Story 4\tTo live a peaceful and comfortable life, one must meet a few requirements first: Congruous personality and logic, adequate fighting prowess, a slow-paced job, and a cushy house in the vicinity of one's office.\nAlhaitham has checked all the boxes above. He would never deny that no place suits him better than the Nation of Wisdom, where social capital is linked to one's academic abilities.\nHis current house, which is located near the Akademiya, is one of the academic resources that he gained through promising research projects. This house's story dates back to Alhaitham's student years. If his classmates still remember him, they will recall that he was not one to mingle with the crowd. As a result, he has only participated in one joint research project. Despite its eventual success, the project resulted in a huge quarrel and a parting of ways. Little do people know about Alhaitham's part in this story, though they might be acquainted with the other protagonist: The Kshahrewar architect Kaveh.\nThis academic incident is not very widely-known — and in truth, the tale of two geniuses falling out due to differing perspectives is an all-too-familiar one in the Akademiya. But even though their collaboration did fall through, neither of them will deny the other party's exceptional brilliance. As for their research, the Akademiya would later transfer the relevant assets to the researchers involved as per regulation.\nAlthough the two did not continue that research, its great success in the early stage still serves as compelling proof of Alhaitham's academic ability. Later, the Akademiya even used this project, which they had forgotten to cancel, as a reference for allocating housing resources, and as such, Alhaitham was given a very decent house befitting his participation in this ingenious project. But the other contributor, Kaveh, had never approached Alhaitham regarding that allocation. It wasn't until later that Kaveh had someone inform Alhaitham and the Akademiya that he was not in want of a house and thus had no use of this property.\nWhen next they met, Kaveh had gone bankrupt. According to Alhaitham, this former friend of his possesses a personality and values that are not congruous with his abilities. The two differ on too many things and cannot reach a consensus even today.\nAllowing Kaveh to stay in this house provides Alhaitham with an interesting research topic: Legally and socially speaking, since Kaveh has previously forfeited the right to his half of this house, he should pay the landlord during his stay. However, paying rent would, to some extent, deny his contribution to the research, which contradicts the academic spirit.\nAn intriguing matter to consider, but Alhaitham has no interest in the answer. Thus, he has taken his broke former colleague in, collects rent as the rightful landlord, and gives his colleague some household chores. He is well aware of the dissatisfaction Kaveh might have, but it matters not to him. As far as Alhaitham is concerned, Kaveh is a familiar face, similarly lacks familial attachments, and is the polar opposite of himself as a scholar — that is to say, an excellent mirror. Human vision is limited, but it can be perfected through the presence of another genius. Taking this opportunity, Alhaitham will be able to observe other aspects of this world and thus understand more things that may have otherwise been unfathomable.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe Nation of Wisdom places academics and knowledge above everything else. As such, a scholar acknowledged by others within the Akademiya usually possesses a higher social status. Alhaitham was born to just such a family of well-received scholars. His parents died very early in an accident, and he was raised by his grandmother, a Kshahrewar scholar.\nAlhaitham doesn't have many recollections of his parents. He learned from his grandmother that they were both employed by the Akademiya, with his father being a mentor in Haravatat and his mother, a renowned scholar in Vahumana.\nAlhaitham has inherited his parents' intelligence, and he was always the sharp kid amongst his peers, so much so that he started reading abstruse academic journals at around the age of seven. Having noticed his exceptional talents, Alhaitham's grandmother suggested that he attend school early. However, it only took half a day in the Akademiya for little Alhaitham to report this back to his grandmother: Everyone he met there was boring and he preferred reading alone to listening to their meaningless courses. Alhaitham's grandmother saw his parents' talents and personalities in him, and agreed to let him stay home to be self-taught.\nTo Alhaitham, \"to be self-taught\" means to read, break down, reorganize, and question. Due to his family background, he was lucky to be exposed to books made of paper. Interestingly enough, he takes more pleasure in reading his grandmother's hard-copy collections than obtaining knowledge from the Akasha directly.\nAs opposed to the Akasha, books are inflexible and rigid, and there is no guarantee that their contents are error-free either. To use such a medium of knowledge is to dance with potential misinformation. The majority of people in Sumeru hate this, but Alhaitham derives great enjoyment from it. It was from reading that he acquired the ability to learn, analyze, and even rectify, and ultimately, he has learned to question. If the rustic and primitive method known as reading is ever any trouble, it is trouble that Alhaitham appreciates.\nAlhaitham's grandmother told him: \"You and your father both like reading. Now, I can't say if the two of you have been given too much share of wisdom or not, but always remember that being different is a gift.\"\nKnowledge is to be recognized, pursued, and trusted, but one should never forget to question it. Perhaps only those who come to such an understanding will not be easily moved by Canned Knowledge and other convenient knowledge media. And only someone who had already met these prerequisites would have casually read the Akasha manual sealed deep within the House of Daena.\nAs Alhaitham's grandmother had said, books contain useless information, and sometimes in large amounts, but his sharp mind will sift through them — and if a book he has read lingers in his memory, it will come in handy one day.\nAfter his grandmother's passing, Alhaitham managed her funeral on his own, inheriting her properties and her small library. Before she passed away, Alhaitham's grandmother gave him this earnest blessing: \"You are such a smart child. Many such people have large egos and a propensity to act on their own. You are outstanding and possess a broader horizon than ordinary people. This is not a bad thing, but you must take care to have a clearer mind than others. You must understand that vain pursuits are but dust, and that you must discern your path with the greatest of wisdom.\"\nLater, Alhaitham applied for the Akademiya and was immediately admitted, scoring high marks in the Haravatat entrance exam. He was informed that his grandmother had also applied for him to be able to attend classes in other Darshans. Following his late grandmother's advice, Alhaitham has always kept a low profile and a clear mind, and always makes decisions for himself.\nYears later, when Alhaitham moved into his new house, he brought all those books over. While sorting through them, he flipped through a few that he had read long ago. The journals that had well-wishes written on their title pages were from his mother's collection, and the ones with reference materials inserted between pages and notes on the margins had once belonged to his father. On top of them, there was a thick book with an exquisite, emerald-colored cover. On the title page, his grandmother had written thus: May my child Alhaitham lead a peaceful life.",
            "The Doer's Belt Pouch\tA sturdy and durable green belt pouch.\nPeople often mistake it for a wide belt, an impression perhaps reinforced by its color being in perfect harmony with Alhaitham's outfit.\nThere are only a few things in this pouch: Keys, some recent read of Alhaitham's, and a portable music player that goes with his headphones.\nAlhaitham personally made the music player when he first became the scribe, and it is connected to the headphones via cables of the same color. He sometimes uses the gadget to play music, and other times, to block noise.",
            "Vision\t\"The value of language is not limited to words. A unified language helps to govern thoughts. Language is the bottom line, rules, weapons, and violence. By making our language unique, we can open up a special path to the relative completion of minds.\nGoverning thoughts may appear meaningless to some, but to others, it has a very significant meaning. Individuals' pursuit of uniqueness gives rise to various languages and media. People are controlled by language under many circumstances.\"\nAs Alhaitham flipped through these pages, reaching the end of the book and its back cover, he realized that an intricate ornament had been underneath the tome this whole time.\nOf course, he knew what it was — a Vision, the proof of one's power. However, this item did not mean much to him.\nA believer might have perceived this divine item to be a thing most lofty, but to him, it was no more than a useful tool.\nAlhaitham was out on a research trip when he was given the Vision.\nHe didn't plan to dwell too much on it. It belonged to him, after all, so what difference would it make if he checked on it tomorrow, as opposed to today?\nAnd just like the knowledge he has acquired, what he has obtained shall always remain in his possession."

            "Character Story 2\tThere was only one way to discover the identity of Aloy's parents — victory at the Proving, the tribe's annual hunting contest, in which the victor would be free to ask for a reward.\nShe would train hard all her life for that event, but when the moment of trial came, the ritual would end in tragedy.\nMysterious assassins slew the participating Hunters, and it was only through Rost's sacrifice that Aloy was able to escape.\nLater, Aloy would learn that she was the true target of the attack, for she had almost exactly the same face as an enigmatic, ancient woman.",
            "Character Story 3\tAloy knew that she had to find these killers to understand her origins.\nHer pursuit brought her into a wild and dangerous world far beyond her imagination, bringing strange and powerful tribes, mysterious ancient ruins, and terrifying enemies — whether human or machine — before her.\nIn the end, the true enemy, HADES, appeared before her. It was an artificial intelligence filled with malice, bent on cleansing the world of all life.\nThere was only one way to defeat HADES: investigate her link with that ancient woman, that \"Aloy from the past\"... Or could she have been her mother?",
            "Character Story 4\tHot on HADES' trail, Aloy traversed a great many ruins from the distant past, and ultimately discovered her origin: she was not born of human flesh and blood but was the result of cloning.\nThe genetics of the woman who had saved all life 1,000 years ago had been the basis for her creation.\nThis had not only granted her the abilities she had possessed since birth, but had also guided her destiny, for this genetic material was the key to preventing the second coming of the apocalypse.\nArmed with this knowledge, and with the help of allies from many tribes, Aloy was finally able to defeat HADES and its human and machine minions in a decisive battle in the shining city of Meridian.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter defeating HADES, Aloy embarked on a new journey, pursuing ancient technologies and cleansing the land that HADES had trampled underfoot.\nIn her long journey, she found every Old World Ruin that there was to be found in search of the Old Ones' lost secrets.\nIn one ancient, dilapidated laboratory, she found something she had never seen before — a gleaming portal. As she drew close, she was enveloped by powerful energies, and she saw her own image within the portal as one looking into a mirror, feeling as if she were in two places at once.\nWith a flash of light, the \"world\" that Aloy knew completely disappeared from her sight, and she now found herself in a strange, beautiful new world just waiting to be explored."

            "Character Details\tAmber is an Outrider of the Knights of Favonius. In an age where Outriders are becoming obsolete, she continues on with her responsibilities.\nIt takes a newcomer only a few days to feel right at home with this passionate girl.\nWhether it's before the Good Hunter's signboard, the banks of Cider Lake, or the tree tops at Windrise, one can find traces of this vigilant Outrider in red anywhere. \nOnce spotted by her, no suspicious individual can ever escape her interrogation.",
            "Character Story 1\tFrom a young age, Amber has always had boundless energy and a positive outlook on life.\nEach day, she burns with a fiery enthusiasm that sees her go about her life like a whirlwind, smashing through any obstacle that stands in her way.\nAt times, however, her excessive energy can make her quite the troublemaker.\nNeedless to say, she was quite a handful when she was young. Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on her grandpa's head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a Dendro Slime's leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.\nSomehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran Outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.\nTo Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.\nBut it was only on the day that her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years.",
            "Character Story 2\tAmber's grandpa was once the leader of a mercenary group. He came from Liyue Harbor and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed Teyvat. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack. he was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.\nToo ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.\nBefore long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each one of them personally, and began leading them on missions.\nIt also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of Mondstadt and started a family.\nYears later, Amber was born into that family. During the day, she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the Outriders. At night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.\nAmber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew.\n\"When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then, I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?\"\nAs the coarse skin of her grandpa's palm rubbed against her head, a bewildered but earnest Amber nodded energetically in response.",
            "Character Story 3\tSomething happened one day four years ago that profoundly changed Amber.\nThat day, her grandpa left his coat of arms and sword in his office and simply disappeared, leaving no note and telling no one he was leaving.\nHe had been the beating heart and the backbone of the Outrider division, and without his leadership they rapidly became undisciplined and lost their edge.\nA few failed operations later, the Outrider division was facing obsoletion. In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.\nOn top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.\nAmber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.\nShe had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage — and lots of it.\nShe wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.\nBut more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland.",
            "Character Story 4\tLife in the Knights of Favonius was not easy for Amber in the beginning.\nBeing as young as she was and having just lived through the trauma of losing her grandpa, the senior knights made a point of taking special care of her.\nHowever, for a girl as desperate to excel as she was, being taken care of by others implied that she wasn't yet mature enough to stand on her own two feet.\nAccordingly, she voraciously sought out extra responsibilities and made this as visible as possible to her seniors.\nFinally, during an intense engagement with some monsters, the seniors noticed her bravery and resourcefulness in the heat of battle.\nThat was the moment when they realized that their little girl was growing up.\nAs she matured, she also became more at ease with herself. Whatever feedback she met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence, or taunting, her response was always the same.\n\"For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!\"\nAmber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.\nShe firmly believes that she will not disappoint her grandpa.",
            "Character Story 5\tToday, Amber is still the firecracker she always was, burning with endless passion and energy.\nNow that she's all grown up, Amber holds firm to her grandpa's teachings as she spreads her Wind Glider's wings and watches over the City of Freedom with the eye of an eagle and the cautious cunning of rabbit.\nThe \"Crimson Knight\" is known throughout Mondstadt.\nThe people are delighted to see the mischievous little girl they remember growing up to be a guardian they can rely on.\n\"Never fear, Outrider Amber is here!\"\nHer self-confidence is simply unshakable:\n\"I am Outrider Amber, the one and only Outrider — which makes me the best one out there!\"",
            "Amber's Journal\tAmber doesn't make writing a daily diary a habit, only electing to write special or memorable events down in her journal.\n\"I finally caught that magical bird! It's called a Rami... something. I don't remember. But I've been chasing it for three days, and I've only been able to sit down for a proper meal today. That magical bird was a really cunning one, burrowing in the thick forest like that. Good thing I didn't give up! Best of all, Master Jean gave me special permission to pluck a feather plume from it as my reward. Hehe, I'll wear it at my side every single day!\"\n\"I'm sure I followed the cookbook to the letter and grilled the meat for six minutes. But while the outside is charred, the inside isn't cooked yet... Did I not control the heat properly? But I really am hungry, so I'll just have to try again tomorrow. One day, I'll make the best steak, and I'll call it... the Outrider's Champion Steak!\"\n\"I met a strange outlander today. I was suspicious at first, but as it turns out, this outlander is both reliable and capable. Ugh, come to think of it, what would I do if an enemy that strong showed up? ...I musn't fall behind. I must train harder!\"",
            "Vision\tAmber once believed that if she took on her grandpa's post, she would understand why he left Mondstadt.\nHowever, even when she officially became an Outrider, she was no closer to unraveling the mystery behind his wordless departure.\nHer grandpa had left nothing for her to find either, indicating that she would have to forge her own path.\nAmber floundered for a while, until she flipped through an old book of fables that she would eventually come to treasure.\n\"What you lacked was not wind, but courage. It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world.\"\nAmber realized that she shouldn't wait for directions from someone else, but that she should be like those courageous birds that spread their wings and flew into the blue skies.\n\"There must be something that only I can do. There must be.\"\nThe moment she realized this, a Vision began to shine brightly at her hip."

'Cause y'know, I'm numero uno, you're my number two, and together we're the most powerful duo in the whole friggin' world, baby! Hahaha! Ah...

            "About the Vision\tUgh, don't even ask. Just the thought of it makes my blood boil! First, the Shogun's Army goes out and steals everyone's precious Visions — which, already a heinous crime, right? But then... then they go and stick them all over that statue with absolutely no sense of organization whatsoever. I mean, think about it... the more powerful the Vision, the higher up on the statue it should go, that would make sense, right? But nooo, some class-A jerk in the Tenryou Commission thought it'd be funny to put my Vision right at the very bottom! Ugh... Come on!",

I bet that would turn some heads on the streets... like \"Dude, you're rockin' those sweet rainbow horns, man!\" ...Ah, man, this is totally genius! I'm gonna round up the gang and get them working on it ASAP.",

Yep, I really took that one to heart. If it weren't for those words of wisdom, I'm pretty sure I would have given up beetle fighting after losing for the 780th time...

Yeah, so next time someone attacks you, it's my turn to block the blade!",
            "About the Raiden Shogun\tDuring the Vision Hunt Decree, the Shogun had to send her top tengu in person to get my Vision off me. Heh, means she must have found me to be quite the pain in the neck. But, y'know, she's abolished the Vision Hunt Decree now, so no hard feelings, I guess. As long as she's learned her lesson, of course. 'Cause if she pulls something like that again, this old pain in the neck will be back with a vengeance.",

Anyway, I had the last laugh, 'cause she had to foot the bill for 32 bowls of noodles! Haha!",
            "About Kujou Sara\tYou know what, yeah, she beat me during the Vision Hunt Decree. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When you lose, you admit defeat, and when you screw up, you take it on the chin, like a man! And anyway, let's not forget which one of us won't agree to a rematch — her, the tengu warrior! It's just a sumo street fight, I mean, what's she so afraid of? If she keeps snubbing me, I'm gonna have to stop calling her Kujou Tengu and start calling her Kujou Chicken! Heh, we'll see what she thinks of that.",
            "About Gorou\tOh yeah, the doggy general in the resistance... Hey, I've gotta hand it to him, he may be on the small side, but he's got quite the fighting spirit.

And not only that — all the hard-earned loot I bring back and share with everyone? She goes and returns it! But also, she gets me out of jail, and out of every mess we get ourselves into, so I'll let it slide. Besides, I don't wanna get on her bad side... An angry Shinobu would make my life a nightmare.",
            "About Sayu\tAll I did was give her a little pat on the head this one time when she wasn't looking, and now, she pounces to attack every time she lays eyes on me. Haha, what can I say? Tanuki are adorable! What am I supposed to do — not pat one on the head? ...Oh yeah, and that's the other thing — she beats you up for calling her a tanuki, too! What's up with that? I mean, a tanuki's what she's going for, right? Sheesh, talk about getting your fur all ruffled over nothing...",

Wanna know the hard skills that really got me where I am? Eating ramen standing upside down, sleeping with my eyes open, playing the harmonica with my nose, and swatting houseflies with my hair. Yeah, I know. Betcha see it now, huh?",
            "More About Itto: II\tPeople in Inazuma have this ritual every time there's a holiday, or they move, or get sick, or whatever, where they throw beans around and chant: \"Fortune beans are falling down, send the oni out of town. Fortune in, oni out. Fortune in, oni out!\" ...Ugh, the chant gets worse every time I hear it, but the streets full of beans, with my allergies? Total disaster. I've gotta fix this, for every oni out there! We're innocent, people! Quit trying to ward us off and drive us out every time there's a minor life event!",
            "More About Itto: III\tIn a... \"attempt\"... to end human prejudice toward the oni, I had the gang use a Kamera to take a picture of me showing my softer side and stick it to the Message Board in Inazuma City. Next thing we know, some jerks have graffitied all over it! Tsk! Then, some ashigaru blockheads from the Tenryou Commission accused me of disrupting the peace, next it was the Yashiro Commission, complaining it ruined the atmosphere in the area, and finally, even the Kanjou Commission got involved — they sent some lackeys over demanding advertising tax! Ugh, they have no idea who the bad guys are here!",
            "More About Itto: IV\tIn the Arataki Gang, we're proud to welcome people who've experienced adversity in their lives. Don't listen to the people who call us freaks, or weirdos. Every member of my gang is like family to me, and they all feel the same way. Whatever happens, the gang will face it together — both the highs and the lows.",
            "More About Itto: V\tI gotta respect the Blue Oni for sacrificing themselves so that the Crimson Oni could live on... In principle, though, I'm absolutely against it. No one should have to sacrifice their own kind for the sake of a better tomorrow, period. It's only a better tomorrow if it's a better tomorrow for everyone. We need to work together, not have everyone just focused on themselves, making their own sacrifice, trying to look cool in the process... Eh, I guess there's no changing the past, what's done is done. But from this day forward, no more sacrificing, not on my watch! You go to sacrifice yourself, I'll stand right in your way!",

            "Least Favorite Food\tUh, well I am an oni! So there's nothing I hate more than beans. Soybeans, Mung Beans, whatever, I hate 'em all. Just touching one is enough to set off my allergies, let alone eating them. We have to get people to resist this constant urge to throw beans everywhere!",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tWhile walking through Hanamizaka, it is hard not to notice a young man of the oni race named Arataki Itto.\nNever mind his horns or piercing voice sticking out like sore thumbs — the sight of him enthusiastically joining in to play childrens' games is enough to set him apart from the crowd.\nIn any case, his obvious lack of things to do stands in stark contrast to Hanamizaka itself, where craftspeople gather in droves and busy themselves all day long.\nItto claims to be the \"first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang,\" the responsibilities and duties of which he tried to explain to some Tenryou Commission officials when they came to him to investigate a rather harmless street brawl. Unfortunately, they interrupted him not two minutes into the explanation before marking him down as \"unemployed.\"\nThat designation is not exactly accurate, of course: other than the Gang's activities, which the Shogunate does not acknowledge, Itto does also do some odd jobs to stay solvent, usually working one day before taking three days off.\nAs such, a more accurate designation should have been \"three-quarters unemployed.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tObjectively speaking, Itto's reputation leaves much to be desired within Inazuma City.\nEven though he is not considered a villain, he is certainly no law-abiding citizen either. If one really had to assign some sort of hazard level to him, then perhaps the level of being used by parents to keep naughty children in line (\"If you don't behave, Arataki Itto will come and snatch your snacks away!\" for example) might suffice.\nThat said, unlike threats of \"the Great Mujina Youkai grabbing you and taking you deep into the mountains,\" or \"being inlaid upon the Shogun's statue,\" the scenario threatened here can actually occur.\nStill, \"snatching\" is, again, not accurate, for the fate of these snacks is decided fair and square by ritual combat!\nIn the eyes of many, winning snacks off kids in competitions is exceedingly shameless, but Itto believes that every battle must be taken seriously, whether one's foe is a 5-year old child or the Almighty Shogun herself.\nIt is also due to this conviction that Itto can lose to a child without any reservations at all.\nAnd while the adults have much to say about his behavior, the children find Itto the big oni to be a rather good playmate.\nHe is knowledgeable about all manner of street games and plays them all with great gusto. He also stands up for any who are being bullied.\nLately, the children have been very into Onikabuto battles against Itto.\nThe rules of this game are simple and the fighting is both fierce and very watchable. Most importantly of all, they actually have a pretty decent chance of winning this one, unlike with other games.",
            "Character Story 2\tFor the longest time, the Tenryou Commission has regarded the Arataki Gang as a group of only occasional troublemakers who do not require that much attention.\nThis group only has less than 10 regular members and there are many internal disagreements concerning the date of its founding.\nAkira believes that it all began when Itto saved him from a few two-bit ruffians. That day, Itto persisted even after having been knocked to the ground 7 times, ultimately causing the punks to back off in annoyance. Helping Akira up from the ground, Itto declared: \"Well, guess you're with the Arataki Gang now!\"\nGenta and Mamoru believe that the Gang was truly founded at the end of a certain year when they all squatted on the outskirts of Inazuma City and roasted Lavender Melons.\nThat day, not one of them had a single Mora to their name, and they were all very hungry indeed. While gorging himself on a melon, Itto said with a sigh, \"We should roast Lavender Melons like this every year!\"\nThat said, neither Genta nor Mamoru thinks that these experiences need much memorializing.\nFor Kuki Shinobu, the Gang was officially formed the first time she had to drag Itto's sorry behind out of Shogunate gaol, for this was the first time any official records had ever made mention of the Arataki Gang.\nAs for Itto, he believes that the Arataki Gang existed from the first moment those words entered his mind.\nUnfortunately, he no longer remembers when that was.\nAnd as for Granny Oni, who has taken care of Itto since he was young, she believes that the Gang was never formed.\nTo her, these children are just \"Itto and his friends.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tThe land of Inazuma has been home to the oni race since antiquity.\nThey existed here alongside the lordly Hakushin kitsune bloodline and the tengu.\nSuch youkai often have supernatural abilities that humans could only look upon in envy, but the oni lack many special traits in that regard.\nOther than the horns on their heads, they are mostly remembered for their explosive tempers and penchant for making trouble.\nAs for their legendary fear of beans, it has a scientific basis.\nAs it turns out, oni are allergic to beans. However, because the oni bloodline has thinned out greatly over time, most people display only very minor allergic reactions.\nUnfortunately for Itto, his allergies are still pretty severe. Forget eating beans, so long as he makes skin contact with them, Itto will get itchy all over and even find it hard to breathe.\nThis thus makes beans the only thing that the usually carefree Itto is particularly wary of in his daily life.\nFor their part, the Arataki Gang members do not order any dishes made with beans, not even in private, as a mark of respect for him.\nOf all products made with beans, Itto fears Fried Tofu the most — indeed, he even says that the very sight of it leaves him feeling queasy for three days straight.",
            "Character Story 4\tAnd when one mentions Fried Tofu, a certain pyrrhic victory immediately comes to mind.\nThe battle that caused that incident began as a rather pedestrian conflict: a fox-eared lady had happened to sit in the chair that Itto would customarily sit on while eating at his favorite food stand... and on his payday, no less.\nThe two began a contest of words over whom the chair belonged to, culminating in a straight-up (unnecessary) battle.\nItto, hungry from a hard day's work, chose an eating contest, while the fox-eared lady chose a theme of \"kitsune ramen.\"\nItto was momentarily at a loss when he realized that said ramen contained Fried Tofu, but with the oni race's pride on the line, he soldiered on gamely en route to victory nonetheless.\nAnd as for that innocent chair, it was ultimately given to Itto as a trophy by the rather mortified owner of the food stand.\nRegarding the various contests he has been in, there are two that still weigh on Itto's mind quite heavily.\nOne of them is the rematch that he demanded of Kujou Sara, who defeated him and took his Vision as part of her duties in the Tenryou Commission.\nTo this day, the Kujou has not agreed to the street corner sumo match, something that frustrates Itto to no end.\nThe other incident happened many years ago when Itto was young. Then, he had gotten into an argument with a young tengu, the result of which was a sumo match in the Byakko Plain. Unexpectedly, the ensuing furor sent them both rolling down a mountain.\nIn the end, it was the tengu who carried Itto, who could not walk after spraining his ankle, all the way home. Of course, the match went unsettled.\nJust his luck, Itto often thinks, that both such incidents had to do with tengu!\nAlso, how on earth were these tengu all so strong despite looking so skinny?",
            "Character Story 5\tEvery oni child has probably heard the story of the Crimson Oni and the Blue Oni:\nThe gentle, helpful Crimson Oni defeated the wicked Blue Oni, thus winning the respect of the humans.\nThis was Itto's favorite story when he was young, and he was proud of his red oni horns and his Crimson Oni lineage.\nHowever, this simple pride was shaken by a certain incident.\nWhen incidents of robbery occurred in the village in which Itto lived, the Arataki family fell under suspicion on account of their oni heritage.\nItto no longer remembers the details of that incident, but he remembers the wary, disgusted stares the villagers gave him and his parents as they left, and the parting words they said, which Itto has heard countless times since:\n\"Once an oni, always an oni.\"\nNo matter the time period, all oni are the same as far as humans are concerned. In that case, would it not be better to become the Blue Oni, whom people feared? Surely that was preferable to being like his parents, who were driven out despite having done nothing wrong.\nAfter his parents died of illness, the young Itto was turned out onto the streets, where he would lay into anyone who spoke ill of the oni race.\nWell, Itto was mostly the one getting laid into. But he proved quite the pain in the neck, never giving up no matter how many times they knocked him down.\nStill, he was only a child and eventually collapsed on the street due to exhaustion and hunger after a terrible round of beatings at the hands of some ruffians who had banded together against him.\nAt this moment of crisis, Itto was saved by an old human woman.\n\"Why did you save me? Can't you see that I'm an oni?\" \"You must be hungry. Come, I've made some porridge.\"\n\"I told you, I'm an oni! Can't you see them horns?\" \"Oh, I can see them. Do you want some of that porridge, by the way?\"\n\"Agh, you know what, you're not listening to me at all. Oh, alright... One bowl of porridge, please.\" \"Coming right up.\"",
            "The Great Singalong\tAs the year was drawing to a close, the Arataki Gang met to discuss how they might celebrate the turnover of the year.\nAs opposed to more reputable organizations, the Arataki Gang did not have any fixed venues to hold their activities, which posed some... logistical issues.\nThe Lavender Melon suggestion was quickly eliminated. While roasting melons itself was certainly not an issue, eating only that to celebrate the new year certainly was.\nAn Onikabuto festival was considered, but the year's end was not mating season, and so the contestants would not be half as motivated as they usually were.\nUltimately, lots were drawn, and the \"Great Singalong\" was selected.\nThis activity was suggested by Itto himself, and it entailed everyone standing on a cliff and singing against the ocean wind to express their innermost feelings and well-wishes for the future.\nThe various gang members actually rejected this in their hearts when they found out about it. After all, screaming into the wind was nowhere near as fun as eating melons. Kuki Shinobu even indicated that she would like to take leave to return home on that day.\nHowever, the event went through nonetheless. The yelling and hollering were indeed quite soothing for the soul — and as things unexpectedly turned out, Itto was quite the good singer as well.",
            "Vision\tItto's Vision was something he found under his hip after waking up one morning. By that point, he had already been in Hanamizaka for many a year, and his livelihood was at least somewhat stable.\n\"Well I never! Dad, Mom, Gramps, Granny, and Granny Oni, this... Now isn't this something?\"\nThese were Itto's real thoughts as he first looked upon his Vision.\nThat day, he would excitedly show his Vision to every person he met, even showing people where it had made an indentation on his back until everyone was thoroughly sick of hearing the story.\nA few days later, however, the story would change a little:\n\"Now as you know, I wasn't surprised at all when I first saw that Vision. I mean, you'd expect as much out of the first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang, after all!\"\n\"More importantly, a person's worth isn't something that can be determined by a mere Vision, oh no, sir!\"\nThe keen-eyed, however, would notice that Itto had bought a very soft spectacle cloth.\nAlso, a certain question showed up in the advice column of the \"That's Life\" magazine that went like this:\n\"Ms. Hina, how should I best take care of my Vision and make it shinier? And when I say 'shinier,' I mean shinier than everyone else's, of course!\"\nWhen gang members read this and excitedly showed the magazine to Itto, they were surprised to see the long-time fan of Ms. Hina just look at the mag casually before laying it aside."

            "Good Night\tTime to retire for the night. Oh? \"Can't sleep,\" you say? Well, I'm afraid you'll have to figure something out for yourself. I have a certain suspicion my solution won't be to your liking.",
            "About Arlecchino: Perception\tSeeing yourself clearly is a difficult task indeed, perhaps even a thankless one. After all, they say those who lack adequate powers of self-perception often lead a happier existence.",
            "About Arlecchino: Cold Blood\tOn occasion, I hear others whisper in secret, calling me cold and cruel. People are free to believe as they wish, and I don't intend to clear up their misconceptions. Prejudice has a way of concealing the truth, and that is hardly to my disadvantage. Still, I believe the time has come for certain measures to be taken to \"live up\" to their expectations... Let's just hope those on the receiving end of these measures have enough power and status to escape with their lives.",
            "About Us: Compromise\tOur ideals are not entirely aligned. If we are to work together, we must be willing to compromise. To that end, I'm willing to share certain secrets with you. Information that I choose not to reveal, however, is best left unexplored... for your own good, of course.",
            "About Us: Being a Guest\tThe children simply adore your stories. They often ask me when you're coming around again. I do hope you won't let them down. Betraying their expectations comes with a price... Perhaps that's something worth your consideration.",
            "About the Vision\tFor the longest time, there wasn't anything I desired, until the idea came to me to assassinate Crucabena. It was a ludicrous thought then. She was a Harbinger, famed and experienced, and nearly everything I knew about fighting was taught by her hand.\nHowever, it appears you need only desire something with sufficient intensity, and the gods will answer. In the end, I gained a Vision, and after making certain sacrifices, I mastered this power. Surpassing one's teacher often requires the pursuit of the unexpected.",
            "Something to Share\t\"Flames course through my body like blood\"... This may be nothing but a figure of speech to some. But for me, it's the harsh reality of my existence.",
            "Interesting Things: Aurora\tThe aurora in Snezhnaya is quite beautiful. Certainly worth a visit.",
            "Interesting Things: Spiders\tI once had a pet spider named Bambi. Raising spiders is quite fascinating. They cannot be domesticated like cats or dogs. Any affection bestowed upon them will not be returned, and they require little investment in terms of care. It's the kind of relationship that suits me perfectly.",
            "About Lyney\tClervie once asked me what a \"real home\" looks like, but I had no answer for her. How could any of us know the answer when the House of the Hearth is made up entirely of people who never had a place to call home.\nBy killing Crucabena, I was able to assume the identity of \"Father\" and rebuild the House under a new set of rules. Still, I'm well aware that, even with these efforts, the House is far from that ideal. As for what a real home truly looks like, I suppose that question is best put to the side for now... Perhaps one day, Lyney will be able to give me a new answer.",
            "About Lynette\tLynette's uniquely calm personality is also her strength, and I believe she is more than clever enough to recognize that. She is an irreplaceable part of that little team of three, and I would imagine that role brings her much joy. As her \"Father,\" my duty is merely to give her the space to put those talents to good use.",
            "About Freminet\tFreminet has a complex mind and often hides his emotions. He blames himself for things that aren't his doing and allows them to eat away at his conscience. I would imagine the other children might find it difficult to understand his manner of thinking, but you seem to share a similar delicate sensibility — perhaps you two would make good friends.",
            "About Neuvillette\tMonsieur Neuvillette intentionally maintains a certain \"distance\" in professional and private settings. Many say this makes him cold and unfeeling, but I believe the truth is just the opposite. In order for all beings to be treated equally under the law, a certain level of emotional distance is expected. Maintaining that kind of indifference is, in itself, a demonstration of kindness.",
            "About Furina\tI asked Lyney to deliver an assortment of cakes for her theater troupe to enjoy during teatime. The children made the cakes themselves as a gesture to express the support and enthusiasm of her \"audience.\" I do hope she enjoys them.",
            "About the Tsaritsa\tWhen I was imprisoned, it was the Tsaritsa who pardoned me and gave me the title of Harbinger. I could sense she was a person of true sincerity and compassion, unlike all those pompous hypocrites with their posturing and rhetoric. Yet... It's difficult to say whether her compassion alone is enough to melt the ice and snow that permeates her land. All I can say is this... If we are forced to be at odds one day, I will raise my weapon against her without hesitation, because that is the greatest level of respect I am able to bestow.",
            "About The Jester\tAs the original Harbinger, much about him remains a mystery. Upon our first meeting, he recognized my background with ease, yet to this day, I know little about him.",
            "About The Captain\tHe is very powerful, and that power comes with a high level of responsibility. However, I believe him to be someone worthy of respect independent of the power he holds.",
            "About The Doctor\tWhen I first took over the House of the Hearth, he proposed a number of plans for us to work together. He wanted me to send any \"rejects\" to him. He planned to experiment on them and then share the results with me. I heard that he and the previous Knave had quite the professional rapport in that regard. All I can say is that, if he weren't one of my fellow Harbingers, I would have expedited their happy, little reunion long ago.",
            "About Damselette\tShe is a very special Harbinger. Pose her a question, and the answer you receive will be entirely unpredictable, if she sees fit to give a proper answer at all. Regardless, any answer you do receive is sure to be an interesting one.",
            "About The Rooster\tThe Rooster holds little love for me, and the feeling is mutual. He is an acceptable mayor, I suppose... perhaps even an exceptional one. He has an uncanny ability to make great gains at a small price, which has earned him substantial acclaim throughout his political circles. However \"small\" the price may be, if it continues to come at the expense of my organization, sooner or later... Hmph.",
            "About Marionette\tI have little interest in her. She is extremely... passionate about her research and does not appear in public often. In fact, many of our officers have yet to see her at all. Compared to, let's say, someone who would go so far as to create segments of themselves to better wander across the land, I suppose you could say she is at the other end of the extreme.",
            "About Regrator\tI won't deny that he is a capable and imaginative individual, but he lacks \"clarity.\" He can formulate grand plans and manipulate the economy with ease, yet at the same time, he allows his actions to be governed by the vengeance and hatred locked in the depths of his heart. Rational people often believe themselves capable of controlling their emotions, but I believe that confidence is their greatest weakness.",
            "About The Fair Lady\tShe and Pierro were the first Harbingers I became acquainted with. Her prideful attitude when she first visited the House of the Hearth failed to earn her many friends among the children. Subsequent visits were accompanied by gifts and the stately claim that \"those who dislike me shall receive none.\" The children quickly learned how to play pretend, and she in turn basked in their attention, superficial though it may have been. I imagine she quite enjoyed being surrounded by children, perhaps due to the persistent loneliness that plagued her... I found her sacrifice to be a great shame. May she be reunited with her lover in death.",
            "About Childe\tObjectively speaking, his personality is ill-suited to that of a Harbinger. He often tries to think the best of others... and finds himself used by them as a result. Of course, he is very talented. With time, I'm sure he'll come into his own. I see no need to judge him too early.",
            "More About Arlecchino: I\tYou wish to know more about me? Why, of course. Our relationship is one of mutual trust. There's little need to keep things hidden... I would only inquire as to whether you're truly prepared for what you might learn. Secrets can be sharper than a knife. Innocent curiosity can lead to dangerous places.",
            "More About Arlecchino: II\tThe moment you wield a blade, you realize that different lives carry different weights. Some people have an air of renown and distinction, yet grovel and plead for their lives when faced with death — their outward demeanor nothing more than a hollow facade. Others appear unremarkable, yet carry a heavy burden within. Despite the factors that differentiate us in life... death awaits us all — the great and final equalizer. Cruel, you say? I merely state the truth.",
            "More About Arlecchino: III\tMy Snezheviches and Snezhevnas... those with the courage to walk through shadow even when the world gets dark, and the conviction to embrace the heat even at the risk of getting burned... I will do my utmost to teach them how to navigate life. The House of the Hearth begs favors from no one — like a spider, we hunt for what we want.",
            "More About Arlecchino: IV\tNo one has the power to choose where they come from, but we all have the right to fight for the life we want. In this sense, the world is both unfair and just in equal measure. I don't take in children out of a desire for recompense. In fact, should they so wish, the children are free to leave and pursue a life outside my organization... so long as they're willing to pay the price.",
            "More About Arlecchino: V\tFate can be a peculiar thing. When I was young, \"Mother\" favored me due to the unusual set of abilities I possess. No one was able to discern their true nature, not even me. We could only speculate that they were the result of some sort of hereditary curse. Whatever the origin of my power, all I knew was that it was the source of my strength, and often the impetus for my suffering. It was only after I became a Harbinger that I finally learned the truth from The Jester. He expressed surprise that the Crimson Moon bloodline had not gone extinct, and that, in a strange twist of fate, the House of the Hearth had ended up in the hands of an orphan of that lineage once again.\nI cannot say what the future holds. I trust fate will give me an answer in time, and when it does, I'm prepared to do things my way, even if that means striking down fate with my own two hands.",
            "Arlecchino's Hobbies\tIn my free time, I enjoy observing insects in the forest. The dynamics between them are fascinating — the way they hunt for food, compete with each other, even cooperate... Those that seem formidable aren't always the ones that make it until the end, and a single error can prove fatal. I observe their struggle as they near death, and slowly commit the image of their suffering to memory, much like I do for those that fall by my own hand.",
            "Arlecchino's Troubles\tThe children often make use of words and phrases from popular vernacular that are only comprehensible among themselves, much like the codewords we use during missions. Of course, children often need their own space, and I fully understand that.",
            "Favorite Food\tOn occasion, we hold barbecue dinners at the House, and the children prepare the ingredients themselves. They enjoy participating in activities like that, and the feeling is mutual. After all, it's always possible certain familiar faces will be missing from the crowd the next time a similar event rolls around.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI dislike complex seasonings. They dull one's sense of smell and taste. Allowing the ingredients to maintain their original flavor is also a way to respect their integrity.",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tAn impressive showing of culinary expertise. Perhaps you'd be interested in teaching a cooking class at the House of the Hearth?",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tThe taste is palatable. Perhaps the children will enjoy it.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tThe intent is appreciated, but there is much room for improvement.",
            "Birthday\tThis memo states that today is your birthday. Is that true? Birthdays should be lively occasions. It's always nice to have an excuse to set formal matters aside every now and then, whether it's for the purpose of celebrating yourself or others. Come. I've prepared a feast for you at the House of the Hearth. Let's not keep the children waiting.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tAlways keep moving forward. Never let yourself be constrained by power.",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tI've learned much from you during this time, and I trust the sentiment is mutual.

            "Character Details\tThe Hotel Bouffes d'ete, situated in the Vasari Passage, is a lovely building with clean walls and sparkling windows, and well-mannered, well-groomed children frequent it every day.\nUnlike other mansions of comparable beauty in the Court of Fontaine, the registered owner of this property does not live on-site. Indeed, nearby residents have not even heard of her.\nThe signature on the relevant documentation is but a false identity — the real power lies with someone else.\nIf one could hear the children whisper at night behind the Hotel's closed gates, one would hear this appellation: \"Father.\"\nWhen speaking of \"Father,\" some faces turn worshipful, some hearts are seized with fear, and still others look inscrutable, torn — but their tone always becomes one of respect.\nThese children are part of the organization known as the House of the Hearth. They belong to the Fatui.\nThis place is home to orphans the world over, and the luxurious Hotel is but one of the House's faces.\nAs for this \"Father,\" the master of the House, she is none other than The Knave, Arlecchino, presently Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers.\nThe Fatui — and this Harbinger — enjoy a mixed reputation. But to most of these children, \"Father\" is the most important figure in their lives.\n\"It is only because 'Father' is here that this place is truly like a 'home.'\"",
            "Character Story 1\tAlmost all who have had dealings with The Knave have felt the unseen, oppressive weight that emanates from her.\nShe commands any conversation with ease, and few can keep the secrets of their heart from showing on their faces when confronted with those unique eyes.\nEver ruthless, she will settle affairs while talking and laughing, even being so considerate as to do those who come after a favor by rendering the area spotless, so as not to traumatize them.\nBut none of that is what makes her most dangerous. \"The unknown\" has, after all, ever been the source of all dread.\nEven the children, who interact with her on a day-to-day basis, cannot claim to understand her. Not her hobbies, her dislikes, or the things on her mind when she gazes out to sea.\nEach August, they rack their brains thinking of birthday presents for her, and yet her reactions to each gift are virtually the same.\nThis continued until last year, when Freminet was given a nasty shock by a lizard that leaped down from the ceiling. The little \"invader\" was caught by Lynette's sharp eyes and quick fingers and then imprisoned on top of the table by a bowl she swiftly seized.\nBoth bowl and lizard wound up being taken for that year's gift by The Knave, who just happened to return home at that moment.\nThe next day, when Lyney entered \"Father\"'s office to give a report, he found a familiar figure in the feeding box.\nThe temperature and humidity within the box seemed to be eminently suitable for the little lizard, which seemed to be quite enjoying itself.\n\"Father\" seemed to have experience in rearing reptiles.\nAs The Knave raised her teacup, Lyney immediately shifted his gaze away from the lizard, but he quietly noted this incident to himself.\nThe children seize every opportunity they can to get closer to their \"Father,\" after all.\nThus, Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet began looking up all sorts of knowledge regarding raising lizards, hoping to have something to discuss with \"Father\" when next they saw her.\nBut just a few days later, when he next set foot in her office, the box was already empty.\n\"'Father'... What happened to that lizard?\"\n\"It attempted to open the box lid a few times, so I gave it back its freedom. Our acquaintance was brief indeed, but that was the choice life made.\"\nThe Knave's voice was completely calm. Looking at the confused Lyney, she then directed a casual finger at a bird that was poking about at the windowsill.\n\"Ah, yes. Not long after it left, the lizard became this one's lunch. Now it seems to want me to serve it seconds... Go chase it away.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tVanity is but human, and adolescent children gradually gain awareness of beauty and homeliness. They begin to surreptitious don accessories and trim their split hairs with scissors.\nRebellious little tendencies such as these are of no concern to \"Father,\" nor will she interfere.\nBut should a child reveal their position during a night operation on account of a necklace she would not lay aside — now this would require a \"Father\"'s instruction.\nThus did Arlecchino enter that girl's room, a lovely handbag in hand.\nThe necklace had already been taken off and placed on the table, and the girl stood trembling next to it. She knew her error.\nArlecchino scooped up the necklace and gazed upon it, before walking over and looping it back around the girl's unblemished neck.\nShe then lifted the flowing gold locks around the child's ears. \"Oh, you pierced them yourself.\"\nAnd so \"Father\" once more retrieved velvet ribbon and jeweled earrings from that bag, tying the girl's hair with the former, and affixing the latter to her ears.\nThen, taking her by the shoulders, she guided the girl before the mirror. The young lady reflected within was as a gem-encrusted noble rose, her beauty shining through the unease that blazed across her features.\n\"It is normal to be vain at your age. But do not let these beautiful trinkets arouse vanity and dull your intellect.\"\n\"I'm sorry, 'Father,'\" the young woman anxiously apologized, her terror evident.\nWith quivering hands she reached for the earrings, making to unfasten them. \"It won't happen again, I swear...\"\nBut the mirror showed only \"Father\"'s unwavering calm, her smile seemingly undimmed.\n\"Shh... Do not be so nervous. People often long for that which they cannot have, and it would not do for regret to make beautiful memories seem ever rosier.\"\n\"Wear them. Once you have grown accustomed to them, you will realize that no gem, however exquisite, is any more than an object, cold and dead.\"\n\"This is your new lesson — to understand the source of your emotions. Master them, use them. Never be their slave.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tBefore \"Father\" rewrote the rules, the House of the Hearth had a wholly different face.\nThe previous Knave was named Crucabena. Of course, few used that name directly, and the children all called her \"Mother.\"\nAnd she seemed a perfect one: a friendly smile, a gentle demeanor, conscientiously caring for her family, and never without stories to tell the children.\nYet, should you have been brought up in an even slightly ordinary environment, the tales she told would have curdled your blood and chilled you to the marrow...\nShe would speak of unspeakable cruelties as if they were fairy-tale fantasies, guiding the House members to mutual slaughter, until the strongest among them was selected as \"king.\"\nShe called herself a mother, but never saw the Hearth as her home. To her, the unnumbered sacrifices were but an interesting experiment.\n...\nBefore taking the title of The Knave and changing her name to Arlecchino, the young girl had another name: Peruere.\nShe was an orphan of unknown origin, like all others in the House of the Hearth — a \"child\" of their \"Mother.\"\nMany knew that \"Mother\" favored her especially, indeed, caring far more for Peruere than even her own biological daughter, Clervie.\nAs such, even to the last, few understood why Peruere repaid this kindness with a magnificent assassination.\nCrucabena's insane experimentation took place far from prying eyes, so naturally, almost none knew of them.\nPeruere was thus tarred as having committed \"matricide,\" her madness known to all.\n...\nEven after the dust had settled, she who had once been Peruere — and was now Arlecchino — did not offer any explanation.\nShe indulged the spread of these rumors, and indeed added fuel to the fire from the shadows.\nWhether as a diplomat or assassin, one profits most from seeing through the other party while keeping oneself shrouded in mystery.\nA small tombstone stands at the site where she slew their \"Mother,\" the eulogy penned by her hand.\n\"Here the last light of the setting sun lies buried. Here the coming dawn finds a welcome.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tTo hide her origins and consign the truth to the flames, Arlecchino has always proclaimed herself a Fontainian.\nThe truth is, however, that she discovered an ability to wield a strange fire from a young age.\nThis attracted much curiosity, as no one in her \"family\" knew of such power. But at her young age, this seemed like no ability to be boasted of so much as a deep-rooted curse.\nEach time she let her vigilance wane, this power would run rampant, eating away at her body. First her fingers, then her palms, and then her forearms...\nThe blackened marks were akin to those of burned charcoal, just as she seemed akin to burning firewood.\nHere she had a vague foreboding, that if this dark shadow were to creep up her shoulder, and snake from shoulder to heart, she would likely undergo some sort of \"change.\"\nPerhaps that would be the moment fate tipped its hand to her.\n...\nEven without the corrosion, this flame brought her other troubles.\nThose rendered ash by these fires would leave \"afterimages.\" At times, they were fragments of memory, and at others, they donned the aspect of dazzling colors.\nAs those who fell at her hand increased, Arlecchino began to hear various voices.\nScreams, wails, and hurled recriminations would wake her from dreams, and she soon grew used to this. She had few dreams worth remembering fondly, in any case, filled as most were with crimson moon and barren wilds.\nIn cases few and far between, these afterimages would be complete enough to take on the form of a \"conscious individual.\"\nOf course, these were hardly as special as \"Clervie's shadow,\" but they would still appear by Arlecchino's side, driving the clamor away and buying her a moment's respite.\nLike children at play, they would gather for a time, and then drift away as they pleased.\nArlecchino remembered who they were in life. But she would never call them by their names.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter meeting the Tsaritsa, being bestowed with a Delusion, and inheriting the name \"Arlecchino,\" the young Knave was also granted an individual audience with her superior.\nDirector Pierro's expression lay hidden behind his half-mask.\n\"I know you still harbor dissatisfaction and doubt. As such, I will answer five of your questions concerning the world... or concerning yourself.\"\n\"You need not ask for guarantees from me, ask about our programs and principles, or about Her Majesty's ideals. Those, I can answer freely and without reservation.\"\nArlecchino did not wholly trust The Jester's open honesty.\n\"Then let me also state that I reject any deliberate mystifications or obfuscations, as well as word games and lies.\"\n\"Most prudent. In that case, allow me to answer the first question weighing on you. Why did we choose you, and why did you accept? 'The naive will die for their ideals, but we are willing to endure even the meanest existence to accomplish our goals.'\"\n...\n\"Question three. What do my constant dreams of a crimson moon and my powers mean?\"\n\"I once served the final dynasty of an ancient underground kingdom. Its dynastic name was 'Eclipse,' and before them came the 'Crimson Moon.' As for the secrets from before your birth... I suggest you purchase a book named 'Hleobranto Innamorato.' I read no such tales in the days when I pursued academic attainment and saw it only by chance. The circumstances depicted are specious, but the key details are accurate.\"\n...\n\"Question five. What will become of me and the others in the House of the Hearth once everything is finished?\"\n\"I will be frank. None of you have any place in my ideals, for I plan only to uphold 'the virtue of folly.' But I can guarantee that our Tsaritsa will once again be a god who loves all humans, and in her ideals shall all human wishes be granted.\"\nThis \"virtue of folly\" was, of course, left enigmatic, but she accepted this answer nonetheless. The Fool had given five answers to her five questions, and the mist that covered her eyes was beginning to part.\n\"Arlecchino.\"\nPierro called out to her as she departed, and she turned around.\n\"Rather than dwelling on how the world is now, you should consider to where it should go.\"\nThe sounds of her departing footsteps as she spun on her heel and kept walking were the only reply.",
            "\"Marelle\"\tThe House of the Hearth uses many codewords to maintain operational security and secrecy, and of these, \"Marelle\" was personally selected by The Knave herself.\n\"Marelle\" takes its meaning from a popular Fontainian children's game. Boxes sequentially marked with numbers are drawn out on the ground, a sandbag is thrown into one of the boxes, and the player will jump from box to box in a specific order.\nNo one knows when this game began to spread, nor who created the rules, but all young children of the Hearth have experienced being taken by older children to play the game.\nLight-footed leaps, boisterous laughter... The memories married to \"Marelle\" were always wonderful, like the kiss of radiant sunshine.\nAs such, at first the children were perplexed when their \"Father\" was torn between assigning \"At Ease\" or \"Danger\" to that codeword.\nLittle did they know that in the House that came before, Marelle was no game.\nIn those days, each and every child would leap into the boxes one by one under the vigilant eyes of the adults. Stepping out of the lines or breaking the rhythm was not allowed.\nThere was never a need to ask the punishment for making a bad jump, for the area outside of the boxes was lined with upturned blades.\nThose who lost their balance, whose stamina failed, or simply made an error out of fear... So, so many fell beyond the bounds, and the dark-red soil mourned that painful past.\nNone would have associated it with being \"at ease\" — indeed, few could speak of it without blanching.\nYet, after her hesitation, Arlecchino chose \"at ease\" as the codeword's meaning that day.\nMarelle was by then no longer associated with \"danger.\" Now, all that came to mind when this game was mentioned were smiling faces.\nIn which case, she thought, let those unhappy memories dwell in her heart alone. Let the blood and dust be wiped away, for should children not see a broader future?",
            "Vision\tArlecchino has many sources of power.\nThe ancient Balemoon Bloodfire burns within her, the noble blood serving as both curse and blessing — this was her first support.\nThe merciful Tsaritsa pardoned her matricide and granted her a Delusion, proof of royal favor and a badge of honor. That was the third time she obtained a source of power.\nBetween these two, the girl who still called herself \"Peruere\" received a Vision.\nWhile Clervie yet lived, Peruere had mooted the idea of assassinating \"Mother\" to her. Perhaps she lacked confidence, or perhaps it was their familial bond that yet shackled her, but Clervie refused.\nClervie's destiny concluded when the cold blade pierced her. But as she slipped away towards death, she was truly happy, for she had finally found her freedom.\nBut for the living Peruere, fate's gears had only begun to turn.\nThe experiment to select a \"king\" was over, but \"Mother\"'s ambitions were far from fulfilled.\nPeruere thus decided to undertake the plan that had once been shelved solo.\nFrom that day on, she silently calculated the gap between herself and \"Mother.\" Her martial skills were the fruit of her \"Mother\"'s tutelage, and the strength flowing through her bloodline was laid bare before \"Mother.\"\nAnd what was a child before adults but a nestling — even one who had emerged as ruler of the roost?\nBut what her life of suffering up till now had not taught her was how to give up.\nThus Peruere constantly honed herself, though her body became riddled with scars from constant battle, though her arms should be burned black from baleful blood-fire she could not completely control.\nThen, on one moonlit night, a Vision came to her without warning or portent.\nThe round Vision lined up perfectly with the moon, and the glimmering gem tinted the latter crimson—\nWas this her wish?\nWas this merely the fruit of hundreds of days and nights of ceaseless thought?\nSuch a question was doomed to remain unanswered, and so she did not obsess over it.\nShe merely concealed the Vision in the place closest to her heart before sending \"Mother\" a \"pleasant little surprise.\"\nAs a Fatui Harbinger, Arlecchino bows before no god. Yet though it represents the institution of The Seven, she always takes meticulous care of this Vision.\nTo her, this is proof of her defiance of fate, wresting from it command over her future."

You don't require medical attention? Oh, so you came to see me... Ah, then I'm sorry, I'm afraid I must ask you to wait. I'd like to see the other patients first before discussing things any further.",
            "Chat: Let's Slow Down\tBaizhu: *huffing* When on the road, one should take ample time to pause and appreciate the wondrous scenery along the way.\nChangsheng: You're about to collapse, aren't you?",
            "Chat: Natural Laws\tLife, death... and the world around us all follow a set of laws... Hehe, but if you never test the limits, how can anyone know where the boundaries of these laws are?",
            "Chat: Physical Condition\t*coughing violently* Ah, it's just some chronic problem I have flaring up again, nothing to worry about.",

            "About Baizhu: Modern vs. Ancient Medicine\tYes, my master did entrust to me many medical formulas from the ancient era. However, although the ancient prescriptions were compiled by our ancestors and have stood the test of time, we mustn't also forget to look forward. Times have changed, and so have our surroundings and customs. Treatments that were effective in the bygone times may not prove to be as effective now. Clinging to the classic prescriptions of the past may not ultimately serve the best interest of the patients nowadays.",
            "About Baizhu: Bolstering Hope\tPeople who suffer from chronic illnesses are often mentally exhausted, and if their condition becomes critical, they may find themselves clinging to life with only a final, thin thread of hope. At such a moment, healing their body is not the priority; the doctor should focus on bolstering their faith in themselves. After all, if the patient believes they aren't going to make it and gives up on themselves, then no medical treatment will be able to help them, no matter how sophisticated the treatment may be.",

            "About Us: Medicine Testing\tA poison to one may be a boon to another. What may be considered to be a universally harmful substance to one group of people may prove to be the perfect medicine needed to save another room of patients. The mechanism behind this is easily understood by those well-versed in pharmacology. It's just that I can't ever tell my patients these kinds of details. If they were to find out that I gave them a poisonous substance as a prescription, it might scare them away for good.\nHehe, you're the first person who's never flinched at hearing this. You are the wise Traveler after all — I'm sure you've seen a lot on your adventures. So, ahem, I suppose you'll be fine with more... potent prescriptions in the future, then? I've been worried about finding people to test my medicine on, hehe.",
            "About the Vision\tHehe, the gods have somehow allowed a delusional person such as myself to explore the nature of life and death. This Vision was just the thing I need, and I'm most thankful.",
            "Something to Share: Candied Fruit\tIt might sound ironic, but even I don't like taking bitter medicine. You're aware of my weak physical condition... I've been routinely taking medicine for some years now. All I can really do is eat some candied fruit afterward to get rid of the bitter aftertaste.",
            "Something to Share: Secret Medication\tI've met some people who jump to conclusions and believe they've contracted some deadly disease the moment they experience even the slightest discomfort. Reasoning with them is useless. Eventually, I came up with some tasteless pills made of Sweet Flower and Qingxin, and prescribed them to these patients. After they calmed down and their \"symptoms\" subsided, they praised the effectiveness of my secret medication. But I suppose I can't fault them for prioritizing their health.",
            "Interesting Things\tIt's said that there are a wide variety of mushroom species native to Sumeru's rainforests, and that some species can even cause hallucinatory effects, which may have medicinal value. However, I've never had the opportunity to study these mushrooms in detail. I'm thinking to go and have a look for myself the next time I'm on vacation.",
            "About Qiqi\tYes, you've guessed correctly. The preservation of a thread of Qiqi's consciousness was in fact the work of the adepti. It's also thanks to Qiqi that I managed to come up with a way to save someone on the brink of death. Since the adepti took pity on this child and even used their arts to keep her on this side of existence, I thought I'd take the opportunity to keep her around the pharmacy. There's no harm in that, is there?",
            "About Hu Tao: Different Approach\tWe have some differences in ideology, that's all. I don't harbor any ill-will toward Director Hu. If anything, I think she's more wary of me.",
            "About Hu Tao: Exhausting Encounters\tBaizhu: If possible, I sincerely wish that Director Hu would be more sensible about her business practices.\nChangsheng: Oh, so you haven't forgotten about the time when she was disseminating flyers right outside of Bubu Pharmacy.\nBaizhu: *sigh* I just wish that she wouldn't be so concerned about Qiqi whenever she has nothing better to do.\nChangsheng: Sounds like you have something against her...\nBaizhu: It's not that I take issue with Director Hu... It's just that every time she kidnaps Qiqi, I have to go all the way to the Ministry of Civil Affairs to get someone to sort it all out. It's... quite exhausting.",
            "About Ganyu\tThose with the blood of the adepti have strong constitutions. Even when she is ill or injured, she does not require any medicine to recover. She isn't like your average mortal, who would be left with long-term residual issues if they did not receive medical treatment after a serious injury.",
            "About Keqing\tIf I were to hazard a guess about her health from a face reading, I would presume the Yuheng's frequent looks of exhaustion are due to her long-time habits of burning the midnight oil and never giving her mind a rest. If she wishes to maintain her health, she should stop working and relax from time to time. Unfortunately, she is overly ambitious, and seems to be completely willing to trade her health for her career. Even if I were to tell her this myself, I'm afraid she would not listen to me.",
            "About Yaoyao\tEvery time she comes to play with Qiqi, she complains about the taste of medicine and asks me if I have anything that isn't bitter. If the medicine will save someone's life, who cares how bitter it tastes, hmm?",
            "About Zhongli\tAh, Zhongli... Yes, I can tell he is very knowledgeable. He can carry a conversation even when discussing niche topics like ancient medicine. He must also have some habits and practices for himself when it comes to healthy living. The common headache or fever should pose no problem for him, so he doesn't need a prescription from me.",
            "About Xiao\tBaizhu: Only the most magnanimous soul could labor to preserve life by slaying evil spirits. I was once fortunate enough to see the Conqueror of Demons with my own eyes. We even brought him back to the pharmacy to take care of him for a day. Unfortunately, I did not know his true identity at the time, and didn't even have a chance to speak with him before he left on his own.\nChangsheng: But you've seen him since then, haven't you? There's no reason to be upset.\nBaizhu: Yes, you're right.",
            "About Tighnari\tAh, so you have an acquaintance from the Sumeru Akademiya? In that case, could I trouble you to introduce me to this Tighnari? I have many questions about herbal medicine that I would like to ask him.",
            "About Gaming\tGaming has quite a lot of scars and old injuries compared to other people his age. And every time he comes to see me, he always seems to have a new bruise here, and a new sprain there... *sigh* No matter how many times I insist that he needs to be more careful, it always goes in one ear and out the other. All I can do is teach him some useful techniques for dressing and treating his wounds. I hope he finds them useful.",
            "More About Baizhu: I\tI am merely a mortal doctor, so I'm afraid I don't have many interesting stories to share. If you're looking for legends, then you should go to the Heyu Tea House and listen to the storytellers there.",
            "More About Baizhu: II\tIf you're looking for some kind of thrilling story, I'm afraid I don't have one. Even when I was studying medicine under my late Master, I didn't experience any particularly dire situations. My master saw that I had a good head on my shoulders, had me swear a simple oath, and took me in... That's all there was to it.",
            "More About Baizhu: III\tThe oath wasn't complicated. I still remember some of it:\n\"...When a person comes seeking medical attention, I will not consider his status, nor will I be suspicious of or worry about any subsequent consequences. I shall strive to witness the patient's distress and feel it as if were my own, for this is the hallmark of a great physician.\"",
            "More About Baizhu: IV\tI understand my master's intentions. He hoped that I would be able to put myself more in the patients' shoes, and not ever be swayed by external factors. *sigh* He really did have a compassionate heart, and was always ready to sacrifice himself for others. It's unfortunate that he passed so early and never had the chance to live his years to their fullest.",
            "More About Baizhu: V\tWhile it is a doctor's duty to save others, the doctor is also themselves a person who deserves to be saved. If we wish to preserve lives, we should strive for an outcome where everyone will live to see another day. Those who willingly give themselves up for others are worthy of our respect, but we should not accept their sacrifice as predestined or an inevitable part of life.",
            "Baizhu's Hobbies\tI enjoy sorting medicinal ingredients and using each ingredient's unique properties to produce pills or ointments. I know this process like the back of my hand. People think that the process of making medicine is difficult and complicated, but to me, it brings endless enjoyment. Amazing, isn't it? That we can condense the bounties of heaven and earth into a tiny, unremarkable pill, and use it to bring people back from the verge of death.",
            "Baizhu's Troubles\tThe most difficult part of seeing patients isn't prescribing medication, but identifying the cause of the disease. *sigh* There could be a million reasons why someone may feel unwell. Maybe they were having a friendly Jueyun Chili-eating contest with someone, and ended up damaging their stomach without realizing it. Or maybe, circumstances led them to drink too much water, which caused them to start feeling nauseous. I just wish people would take better care of themselves, and find something better to do than repeatedly put their bodies through so much distress.",
            "Favorite Food\tYou shouldn't be a picky eater. Meat, eggs, milk, vegetables, fruit... they all have nutritional value and should be a regular part of your diet, but you should also avoid eating too much. Eating or drinking excessively can also be detrimental to your health. Take it from me. As a doctor, I know all too well that many health crises find their way into the body from the mouth.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tWhy would you ever purchase so much candy? *sigh* Just be sure not to eat it too quickly, and remember that too much candy can give you cavities. Me? I seldom indulge in sweets, and I don't often eat spicy food, either. After all, if I don't watch what I eat, then how can I expect that of my patients?",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tChangsheng: Superb! More please!\nBaizhu: It is good, isn't it?",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tWell done. Your culinary skills have improved.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tWell, at least it still tastes better than medicine.",
            "Birthday\tChangsheng: Sss. Refresh my memory, Baizhu. How do we say that again...?\nBaizhu: Hehe. You mean how to wish someone a happy birthday?\nChangsheng: Yes, precisely!\nBaizhu: I hope that this day will be one filled with joy every year, and that you would always keep these times near. Happy Birthday, Traveler!\nChangsheng: Hey, so what should I say now? Let me think... Um, uh... *sigh* I can't think of anything. I sincerely wish you a happy birthday, too.\nChangsheng: What are you laughing at? People are so bothersome, with more traditions and twists than even a snake.",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tBaizhu, the owner of \"Bubu Pharmacy,\" is a master of the medicinal arts. He is benevolent and kind, yet also shrouded in mystery and other contradictions.\nDespite having countless admiring physicians begging for his attention, he has insisted on choosing a zombie who can barely sort medicinal ingredients to be his apprentice.\nAnd though only a mortal, a talking snake with powerful spiritual energy is always wrapped around his shoulders.\nMaladies major and minor may all be mitigated with his medicine, but the physician seems unable to cure himself.\nSuch a person does not go unnoticed in Liyue, for the greater a person's capabilities, the greater the calamity they could cause should their heart harbor any evil intent.\nYet both public observation and private investigation have not only found no trace of any hidden wickedness, but have seemed to confirm time and time again that his unimpeachable reputation as a benevolent doctor was, in fact, the unvarnished truth.\nAs for all those inscrutable secrets, Baizhu simply smiles and laughs:\n\"Good medicine is so bitter, so it shouldn't be a problem to let a good doctor keep a few secrets, no?\"",
            "Character Story 1\tThough he was widely known by the moniker \"Mr. Bai,\" Baizhu's last name isn't \"Bai.\" The origins of this misnomer can be traced back to his apprentice at Bubu Pharmacy, Qiqi, and her sieve-like memory. \nWhen she first arrived at Bubu, her memory was even worse than it is now, and she would even forget to return to the Pharmacy at night after going out to gather herbs and ingredients during the day.\nFortunately, Baizhu is always patient when dealing with patients, and doubly so when dealing with Qiqi. At first, he attempted to have her stay at the Pharmacy and rest, but Qiqi was always resolute and could not be dissuaded from harvesting materials, saying: \"My responsibility.\" Helpless to stop her, Baizhu would personally go out to find her each and every time, and remind her of the fact she lived with him at Bubu Pharmacy over and over and over and...\nWith a memory like what Qiqi sported then, remembering anyone's full name was beyond the realm of possibility. So for a long time, the names \"Baizhu\" and \"Changsheng\" were simply replaced with \"that person\" and \"that snake.\"\nEver one to prescribe just the right medicine for the disease, Baizhu prepared a notebook for Qiqi to write in and review whenever she had time. Finally, there came a morning when Qiqi saw Baizhu and did not cock her head and ask who he was, but said:\n\"Good, morning. Bai... Bai...\" \nChangsheng was ecstatic, and immediately extended her body outward, even more excited than Baizhu: \"Yes, yes, Bai-what now? And how about me? Don't forget about me—\"\n\"Mr. Bai.\" Qiqi answered earnestly. \"And, long... long, snake.\"\n\"—Outrageous! My name isn't 'long snake'—\"\n\"Remembering things is like curing an illness. One cannot be too greedy for progress, but be satisfied with gradual improvement.\" Baizhu smiled slightly and nodded, as though having accepted the name \"Mr. Bai.\"\nIn the days that followed, the phrases \"Mr. Bai said\" and \"Mr. Bai won't allow it\" were never far from her lips, and the endless stream of customers asking after medicine soon brought the name \"Mr. Bai\" out of Bubu Pharmacy to every corner of Liyue Harbor.\nQiqi's notebook has been filled to bursting and then some, and today she no longer needs to consult it before recalling Baizhu and Changsheng's names. \nBut \"Mr. Bai\" had already found its home in the hearts of some, and it was too late to change it.",
            "Character Story 2\tBaizhu is not only a brilliant physician, but possesses considerable business acumen.\nThis should not come as a surprise — it would be impossible to operate a such a large pharmacy on the strength of one's medical skills alone.\nThe prices at Bubu Pharmacy are generally fair, and the pricing strategy for most products is one of high sales with low margins on each transaction. But there is some merchandise priced at a curious premium — such as the \"Everlasting Incense,\" which was 2,990,000 Mora even after a discount.\nUsually, the customers for goods like these aren't picky about price, and only care about the quality and effectiveness.\nSo why head to the market to haggle and search, when you can get everything you need at Bubu Pharmacy? Even if it's a bit more expensive, the peace of mind provided by Mr. Bai's reputation is worth it.\nNaturally, price is not Bubu Pharmacy's only competitive advantage. Many of the customers are businesspeople who have become \"partners,\" bringing Baizhu rare herbs from across the land and exporting the medicines he develops to every corner of the world. As the pockets of Bubu's business partners began to bulge, so too did the Pharmacy's ledgers.\nBut the objectives of Baizhu's plans do not seem to revolve solely around Mora itself. If they did, why would Bubu Pharmacy take care of someone with no positive impact on income flow like Qiqi? It makes no sense from a business perspective.\nWhen encountering unusual or novel diseases, Baizhu often accepts only a token fee, saying \"It is difficult to assess a fee for such a rare ailment.\"\nAs this practice has persisted, clients from far beyond Liyue have come to seek treatment at Bubu Pharmacy. Baizhu never refuses a patient, and is very willing to treat people from all walks of life, regardless of the disease that afflicts them. Thus has the good doctor cultivated a reputation as a selfless and benevolent healer who makes money elsewhere, presumably so that he can continue to perform acts of kindness far into the future.\nBut only Baizhu himself understands the truth: Bubu Pharmacy never engages in unprofitable transactions.\nSome goals are impossible to even think about without massive financial backing and a reliable network supplying resources from across the world. Even with sufficient wealth, those goals would have little chance of success without the right opportunities and a bit of luck.\nAs for the chance to research the secret arts of the adepti and strange diseases... these are opportunities no amount of Mora could ever buy.",
            "Character Story 3\tBaizhu habitually has a pot of water before boiling a pot of tea after waking up early in the morning. There is never a shortage of pastries at the Pharmacy, both sweet and salty, delivered from nearby shops and from around the neighborhood. This routine has never ceased, and is unchanged through all four seasons.\nThe snacks are divided into three portions, two large and one small. The large plates are for Baizhu and Herbalist Gui, and the small plate is for Qiqi and Changsheng. Whichever of them so desires can take a bite, and this counts as having had breakfast with everyone.\nIn addition, the doors of the Pharmacy are always lined with fresh supplies when it opens in the morning: vegetables, rice, fresh fish, melons and fruits... there is always an abundance of food at Bubu Pharmacy.\nBaizhu has repeatedly attempted to persuade the community not to give him such gifts, as he does not like to take things from others for free. But the public knows that Dr. Baizhu doesn't always charge for his consultations, and offers steep discounts upon already reduced prices to the people. The child of this family, the grandfather of that household... The number of people who have benefited from his care is beyond count. Of course, since cheaper healthcare means more Mora in the pocket, using the savings to give gifts by way of thanks is a perfectly sensible thing to do. Baizhu's attempts to dissuade his well-wishers were defeated by this logic, and his only remaining response was to ask Herbalist Gui to bring all the gifts from the door into the shop.\nAfter breakfast, the clinic opens for consultations. Baizhu remains in the shop to see patients, and Herbalist Gui delivers medicines wrapped and prepared the previous night to elderly patients who have difficulty walking. Each package comes with a detailed note explaining clearly both the frequency and quantity of medicine to be taken for the convenience of the patient.\nWhen patients begin arriving at the clinic, Changsheng takes leave of her perch on Baizhu's body and wanders about the clinic. If she catches Qiqi performing her calisthenics in the courtyard, she will wind about Qiqi's shoulders and help her keep time with a \"one two three one two three,\" and so on. If she runs into Herbalist Gui delivering medicine in the corridor, she will rest on his arm and ask after the latest neighborhood gossip.\nAfter the talking is done, the medicine weighted and packaged, and the tea has cooled, it is time for lunch. At this time, Baizhu is at leisure to personally prepare a nutritious meal and sweet soup that are both healthy and tasty for all who come to call.\nAfternoons in Liyue Harbor are a leisurely affair, with studying children, tottering old grandparents, Millelith carrying spears... An endless patter of footfalls. Changsheng and Qiqi lie by the pharmacy door, basking in the sun and watching the flow of people. They idly observe that the one on the left has let their hair grow too long and needs a haircut, while that one on the right has a rash on their face, and might be suffering from an internal imbalance. The sound of their chatter reaches Herbalist Gui's ears, and fearing disturbing others, he brings over a bench and moves Changsheng and Qiqi back inside the pharmacy.\nThe commotion reaches Baizhu's clinic, and he listens to their exchange as he writes a prescription. Time is like boiling water in a copper kettle: at once both a turbulent tumult but also sitting quietly beside you.\nAs night falls, Bubu Pharmacy closes for the day. Herbalist Gui sometimes stays for dinner, and sometimes goes home to eat with his family. Then only Baizhu, Qiqi, and Changsheng remain, and the two people and one snake may eat and drink to their hearts' content, returning to their rooms to rest by the light of the moon.\nOne cannot call such a day anything out of the ordinary. It is simply a day at Bubu Pharmacy. Though, if Herbalist Gui suddenly had the thought to come back and take a peek before going to bed, more likely than not he would happen upon Baizhu teaching Qiqi new exercises in the courtyard to keep her limber.\nOne-two-three, one-two-three... Morning, noon, and night, spring, summer, and fall — oh, and also winter... Calisthenics and life both have their rhythm.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe storyteller rapped the wooden table, opened his mouth, and began to tell a tale of ghosts and demons. Though the public loves to hear these stories, they get old after too many tellings, and so people asked, \"is there anything else? You've told the one about the jewel-seller and the one about the thief, what else is there?\"\nAt that moment, Baizhu came down the stairs, and the audience saw him and thought to themselves: Dr. Baizhu has many stories, surely, but putting them into a book might be far too difficult. Other than discussing his exemplary behavior and medical ethics, if one wishes to say a few words about him over tea or after dinner, the most that can be talked about is the Doctor's private pursuit of the adeptal arts and the like, a matter that Baizhu has never intended to conceal.\nThere are a multitude of visitors to Bubu Pharmacy, and those with sharp eyes cannot avoid noticing the books Baizhu reads in his spare time. In addition to medical treatises are ancient tomes which record the ways in which the adepti may be sought out. In addition, the medicine chests at Bubu Pharmacy contain a multitude of rare herbs and ingredients which are of no use in treating common illnesses, but are constantly used and replenished in an endless cycle. Though the average patient may not understand the arcane implications, those from families which practice alchemy or thaumaturgical arts can instantly recognize that all of these are ingredients used to refine various \"Elixirs of Immortality\" spoken of in legend.\nFor most ordinary people, \"immortality\" is simply too strange a concept. But there are people whose curiosity will be aroused, and who will seek to know just how Baizhu wishes to attain immortality and how far along the road he has come... But this has proved akin to walking on a tightrope at night — it is difficult to take even a single step.\nEventually, news of Baizhu's quest spread. Once the news was leaked, people formed an opinion. Some coveted his knowledge, some opposed this pursuit, and others didn't particularly care about his goal of immortality, but were concerned about the trouble his methods might cause.\nBaizhu himself was in his clinic, but his fingers were on the pulse of the street, and he had anticipated this would happen. In the vast land of Liyue, the concerns of the third group of people would be the most difficult to assuage. He had initially planned to quietly dispel any doubts, but the name \"Baizhu\" had already appeared on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' persons of special interest list. Fortunately, Baizhu always conducted himself impeccably in his daily life, and is amiable and willing to chat with his patients during their consultations. From these visits, he learned that the Ministry of Civil Affairs was keeping a close eye on him. He saw through their methods, and turned the ears and mouths of the people to his own ends, letting them spread the word on his behalf that his research and approach had no ill intent and would cause no trouble.\nRumors spread more quickly than the most infectious pathogen, and soon the fact his quest was benign had spread to every corner. This push and pull between Baizhu and Ministry continued for some time, but eventually he was able to avoid unwanted attention and his name avoided appearing in the top secret intelligence reports of the owner of Yanshang Teahouse, Yelan.\nAs for the aforementioned second group of people, their beliefs are already a known quantity, and set in stone. Many are the descendants of a clan that believes firmly in the principle that some things are divinely ordained, and that the impermanence of life and permanence of death are among those immutable truths. It must be pure coincidence that the representative of this second group lives but a street away at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.\nAs the saying goes, neighbors are like relatives and friends, and Bubu Pharmacy and Wangsheng Funeral Parlor have had many interactions over the years, and both parties greet each other with a smile when their paths cross in the street. As for those questions of life and death, death and life, the opinion of the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Hu Tao is as follows: If the matter cannot be explained or settled in a couple words, it's better to have Baizhu over for dinner! And as for a sensible person like Baizhu? Of course one should attend the banquet! Season after season, year after year, without going into too much detail, the two households with very different views have spent many a day together, and could be considered close friends, albeit with each keeping their secrets.\nWhen two parties do not align closely, they merely speak of etiquette. But when they align, one may speak of duty. For Bubu Pharmacy is in the business of healing the sick, and in the course of business it is inevitable that there will be those beyond saving or at the end of their lives. Those with good fortune are cared for by their family, but those less lucky will breathe their last in Bubu Pharmacy. When this happens, Bubu Pharmacy and Wangsheng Funeral Parlor will jointly ensure their final rest is peaceful.\nThe last rites and journey of the deceased is of great importance, and Director Hu Tao entrusts this to her most dependable consultant, Zhongli. For Bubu Pharmacy, Baizhu cares greatly for those patients who pass away under his care, and personally sees to their arrangements. The two parties hold a ceremony in a secluded thatched cottage in the dead of night. Baizhu sends the deceased there, and the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor consultant holds the ceremony and performs the final rites, carrying out each step in an orderly manner. Even if it is simply going through the motions, the departed may rest in peace.\nIt is a pity that though the soul has passed on, no living soul will ever thank Bubu Pharmacy or Wangsheng Funeral Parlor on the deceased's behalf. But the heavens wheel ever onward, and so too does the cycle of life and death continue unceasingly. Doctor and Funeral Director and consultant are neighbors by coincidence, friends over the dinner table, but only truly meet heart-to-heart when conducting the solemn duty of seeing off the souls of the deceased. Once they walk out of that thatched cottage, they return to their former selves.\nAs for the aforementioned first type of people, those who covet the secret of immortality, though they are many in number, their methods are crude, and they are easy to deal with.\nBandits are common in the wilderness and in the mountains, and a few particularly stupid and shortsighted ones once ran into Baizhu alone on a mountain road. Baizhu was refining medicine, and the bandits, having heard rumors of Baizhu's quest, came to the conclusion that he had made something of value here in this remote location. They struck, expecting to plunder the secret medicine Baizhu had created. A few hours later, the Millelith arrived at the scene of the crime, having received a report. It was difficult to tell who was the real victim, with the ruffians laid out upon the ground and Baizhu standing beside them with a smile.\n\"The facts of the case come first, so forgive me for asking,\" the Millelith soldier began hesitantly, \"but did you really come to place this remote just to make cold medicine?\"\n\"If I was refining some special medicine...\" Baizhu laughed and shook his head. \"Would they ever have found me?\"\nThese stories traveled round and round, eventually returning to the ears of the storyteller. He thought for a moment, then shook his head and sighed: \"Forget it. At the end of the day, Dr. Baizhu is just a doctor. What fascinating tales could there be?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tEvery time the weather turns cold, the threshold of Bubu Pharmacy is crowded with patients seeking a consultation. But today, Baizhu's silhouette was nowhere to be seen. Only his assistant Herbalist Gui was at the counter, prescribing medicine and dispensing medicine. Those with recurring illnesses who visited frequently knew what this meant. It was \"one of those days\" again, and so they took the medicine carefully wrapped by Herbalist Gui. They offered their best wishes, such as \"Please tell Dr. Baizhu to care of himself,\" and shuffled out the door.\nAt that moment, Qiqi came in from the doorway and bumped into an old man's calf. Holding her hat tight, she nodded and hurried to the back room with her stiff steps as quickly as she could.\n\"It's one of those days\" isn't a particular time or place, but rather is shorthand for an oft-used statement: The Doctor is ill, and cannot see patients today, so we are sorry you came all the way here for nothing, please come back some other time.\nIt is hard for physicians to cure themselves, and this is true for Baizhu as well. Baizhu claims that it is simply a chill, but he knows that he has a weak constitution, and all of his internal organs are diseased. Though his life is not in imminent danger, nine out of ten doctors would be dumbstruck, only able to gape in wonder at the nature of this rare and incurable disease. Therefore, whenever his symptoms flare up, all Herbalist Gui and Qiqi can do is bring him hot water, cloth towels, and plates of fruit to show their concern. Baizhu does not wish others to worry on his behalf, and insists on being alone in his room with only Changsheng for company.\nWith the curtains pulled over the tightly closed windows, the room was dark and gloomy. Baizhu lay down, tormented by the chills and following hot flashes, occasional breathing problems, and intermittent yet intense full-body pains that often came whenever his symptoms flared up. After a bout of agony, he joked to Changsheng, \"If I don't make it one of these days, it'll be a giant hassle, won't it?\"\nChangsheng slithered up the head of the bed and looked down at Baizhu's sweat-soaked visage with human-like pupils. \"Oh you, oh you, you may lie, but you may not die. Who is it that wishes to live forever? You are not yet old, and haven't yet experienced a full life.\"\nA man and a snake, the snake with human eyes and the man with snake eyes. A strange phenomenon indeed. Few know the truth behind such an enigmatic anomaly. In fact, the pupils in their eyes are proof of their greatest secret — the contract between them. The result of this contract is the Baizhu of today — practicing medicine to save lives and alleviate the pains and aches of humanity, but also embedding illness deep into his own bones, where they reside forever with no hope of relief.\nAnd in the land of Rex Lapis, God of Contracts, the law is supreme and contracts must be abided by. Liyue is an ancient country with a multitude of spiritual beings and magic, and the contents and types of contracts are equally varied. But Baizhu and Changsheng never discuss the contents of their own contract, and always share the same response: Contract? It's just an agreement, you could say it's just a secret technique with a couple of restrictions on how it can be passed down. Those too old or young, those who are insincere of heart, the inhuman, all of these cannot inherit this technique... What else is there? Oh, yes. \"Those not fated to cannot inherit it!\"\nQiqi put down the tea tray and hot water, closing the door behind her as she left. Baizhu watched her leave before let out a long sigh, as though he had a thousand worries caught in his throat, but was unable to give voice to a single one. All he could do was shift the conversation to a distant rumor—\nIn ancient times, there was once a Mt. Yaojun, and the master of the mountain and their tea-loving friend once made a pact to wait until the tea trees on the mountain had grown, then hold a tea banquet, inviting all the adepti to partake of their tea. What a beautiful thing that might have been! But alas, of the two Adepti who made the agreement, one sank into the water like the residual remnants of tea leaves, and the other lost all ten of their fingers for picking tea, and even their memories of the past faded and were forgotten.\nChangsheng hissed an impatient reply: \"What's so strange about that? The adepti are gone, but don't their tea trees remain? The tree and tea leaves will remember their ancient agreement in their stead. You should worry more about yourself, for if you and I leave, only Herbalist Gui, Qiqi, and the wood of the house and bricks on the floor will remember the two of us.\"\nThe name of the contract with Changsheng is known as \"Way of the Dragon-Dragging Jade Snake.\" Only the name of contract is known, and not even Changsheng can explain the details, only that she learned it long ago. If you ask who she learned it from, she cannot recall even a bit of tangential information. Talking about the distant past with Changsheng is often like this. Baizhu is used to listening to her advice, though, and understands she has good intentions. Thus did he vomit up the blood stuck in his throat before sitting up straight against the head of the bed.\nChangsheng glanced over: \"What're you looking at me for? I don't have hands to support you with.\"\nCradling the soup made for him by Herbalist Gui and Qiqi, Baizhu slowly drank it. He got through it one spoonful at a time, his eyes never leaving the soup for a moment, as though there was an entrancing scene of spring flowers and autumn leaves at the bottom of the bowl.\nThe small things, one at a time. The basic essentials of daily life. Life is like soup, boiling and cooking.",
            "Bubu\tIn Liyue, a form of divination is often used to predict fortune and peril or ask the gods for guidance. The people of Liyue call their particular art \"Zhanbu.\"\nIt is said that in ancient times, medicine and \"Zhanbu\" were tightly linked and often confused. With no scientific understanding of birth, old age, sickness, or death, the ancestors could do naught but pray to the gods for wellness and take medicinal herbs for comfort.\nOver time, countless generations experiencing sickness and recovering upon taking different herbs were able to distill their knowledge into a set of rules, making breakthroughs in their understanding of medicine. Thus was medicine born, with trained physicians curing the sick.\nAfter becoming an heir to this medical tradition, Baizhu brought Changsheng to Liyue Harbor to open a pharmacy and practice medicine in the bustling port city. At that time, the following story took place:\nAccording to the traditions of Liyue, new businesses must divine an auspicious time for their grand opening using the art of \"Zhanbu.\" By sticking to the preordained opening day, the business will prosper and enjoy fame and fortune.\nBut Baizhu did not wait until the day of good fortune. One night, a mother brought her fever-stricken daughter to the door of the pharmacy, frantically pounding on the door.\n...\nEarly the next morning, the neighbors were shocked to discover that the pharmacy had opened several days early, with no fanfare or celebration.\n\"Aren't you afraid of going bankrupt and losing everything?\" Changsheng's voice was full of regret. \"All you did was treat an emergency case last night, why would you need to open up shop early?\"\nBaizhu replied as he wrote a prescription: \"Every day delayed is another day the patients must wait for their consultation. Besides, what pharmacy wants business to boom? We aren't hoping for more people to get sick, are we?\"\n\"That doesn't mean you should just throw open the doors without even thinking of a name for our shop! And what about a celebratory message for the grand opening?\"\n\"A name and a message... Then let us send the message that no matter the fortunes of this shop, or the diseases afflicting our patients...\" Baizhu picked up the prescription note and faced the rising sun framed through the door. \"...Or our fates, we don't need to ask the gods or use divination any longer.\"\nIn the language of Liyue, \"Zhanbu\" is divination, but \"bu\" can also be the word for a refusal or negation. Thus, he chose a name that enshrined his beliefs.\nThe rays of sunlight were shining through the door and the thin paper in his hand, with the words written by his hand clear and confident—\n\"Bubu Pharmacy, Baizhu.\"",
            "Vision\tWhen Baizhu was young, his hometown was struck by a horrific plague.\nFortunately, his master was practicing medicine there, and was able to contain the spread.\nBut no miracle could bring back the lives that had already been lost. Having lost both his parents, Baizhu began to follow in the footsteps of his master, learning the physician's art.\nThe world is full of strange and complicated diseases, but Baizhu's master was always able to provide treatment. Studying with his master, Baizhu learned a simple truth: Disease is dangerous, but it can ultimately be overcome with human intellect.\n...Until the day finally came that Baizhu's master was completely exhausted by the maladies brought on by a contract, and could hold on no longer.\nThough Baizhu had learned much in those years, he was still unable to do anything in the face of such a complicated and serious affliction.\nThat most intractable disease in the world, the one with no cure or answer — death — had finally come for his master.\nWas there really no escape from sickness and death for mortals?\nThe memories of his parents coughing blood from his youth had grown hazier over the years, but the scene of the cold tombstone of his master was crystal clear before his eyes.\nStanding before his master's grave, Changsheng's normally playful words were tinged with an imperceptible sense of melancholy.\n\"Who knows how many more people will take on this contract...\"\nBaizhu did not want to see yet another precious life slip away before his eyes.\n\"No. This contract will end with me.\"\nWhen he next opened his eyes, they shone with a golden light, as though they were unquenchable candles.\nThe first thing reflected in his now vertical pupils was a Vision, appearing briefly like a firefly on his master's tombstone.\nThe Vision was like the gaze of a god who had witness to everything, but it was also like those of his master, gentle and full of expectation."

            "Character Story 4\tBarbara has never once considered giving up.\nHer determination and resilience even surprised her father, Seamus Pegg, the Cardinal of Daybreak.\nBarbara only allows herself to be depressed for 30 seconds.\nAfter that, she forces herself to brighten up, no matter what.\n\"I'm not so good in combat, so I'll be sure to support those who are.\"\nUnder her father's counsel, Barbara became a healer.\nShe is as radiant as the sick and injured are pained.\nHer desire to be recognized gradually transformed into a simple desire to help others.",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Thank you\" are the two words that Barbara hears most often.\nWhen she feels lost, she will suddenly find that there is someone wanting to hold her hand.\n\"Thanks for being here with me. I feel so much better.\"\nTo Barbara, the greatest reward is seeing the smiles on people's faces.\nTherefore, whenever she is massaging her swollen calves or drinking tea to care for her sore throat, Barbara recalls all those who have been kind to her.\n\"It's the encouragement I receive from others that keeps me going.\"\nJust maybe, the smiles she receives are proof that her songs really can heal people.\nHer ambition to surpass her sister and become the most popular person in all of Mondstadt hasn't been abandoned by Barbara, it is simply buried deep inside her heart.\n\"If only I excelled more, perhaps I could be of help to Jean.\"\nThis is what she believes.\n\"Okay... Go Barbara, go!\"",
            "Alice's Idol Magazine\t\"...Idol?\"\nThe first time that Barbara heard this strange word, she was visibly confused.\n\"But... aren't The Seven the ones that people are supposed to worship?\"\n\"Yes, but not exclusively...\" replied Alice, an elder of the Hexenzirkel, as she groomed the young girl for stardom. \"Read this, it contains everything you will need to know.\"\n\"Idol Magazine\" was the name of the assigned reading material. Barbara had no idea what world this magazine had come from, but by reading it she found out that there was indeed such thing as an \"idol,\" and that it mainly involved working hard at getting everyone to like you.\nShe also discovered that an outstanding idol is capable of not just bringing joy to themselves, but also bringing spiritual healing to others through the power of song and dance.\nBarbara set about learning one new song after another, dancing to the beat as she went. Finally, she found happiness, and she found it in the smiling faces of others.\nSome time later, when Alice anxiously relayed to Barbara that plans for \"Teyvat Idols!\" were falling through, Barbara was starting to make a name for herself through her performances in Mondstadt.\n\"Hmm... Well, if I'm the only one left... I guess you can leave it to me to define what it really means to be an idol!\"\nDriven by this ever so slightly selfish ambition to spread joy and healing to others, Barbara is slyly swotting up on new tunes behind the scenes to this very day.",
            "Vision\tThe story of how Barbara obtained her Vision is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.\nShe had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever.\nNothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.\nSomeone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family.\nAnother suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.\nBarbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?\n\"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need,\" Barbara thought to herself.\nAnd so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew.\nIt was an unceremonious beginning to her singing career. After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.\nNevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.\nEarly the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.\nBarbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.\nBarbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tBeidou is the leader of The Crux — an armed crew based in Liyue Harbor.\nAn armed crew means exactly what it sounds like: a crew of sailors armed to the teeth.\nWithout getting into too many details, everything The Crux does is approved by the Qixing... more or less.\nBeidou is a trusted leader, so much so that her crew believes her capable of taming the storms and billows on the sea.\n\"It's Beidou! Even the mightiest of storms must bow its head to her might!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tBeidou is something of a cultural icon in Liyue.\nThough her fame does not quite reach the same lofty heights as that of the Liyue Qixing, one can be certain that every merchant in the city knows her name — and that of her crew, The Crux.\nNaturally, there are rumors abound regarding someone of her status. People love to tell epic tales of her earth-shattering (or rather, sea-splitting) feats. Tales in which her abilities are exaggerated to almost superhuman levels.\nOne rumor is that she can channel Electro energy with her sword. It is said that she once used it to cut a formidable sea monster from the depths of the ocean abyss in half with just one hit.\nBystanders who overhear such tales generally dismiss them as drunken ramblings. But to anyone who has ever voyaged with Beidou themselves, these stories are no joke. In their view, if this world really were home to a giant sea monster from the ocean abyss... Beidou would certainly be capable of cutting it in half.\nIn summary, Beidou's abilities are every bit as impressive as her reputation in business circles. So if you hear her lauded as the Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean — suffice to say that there is no smoke without fire.",
            "Character Story 2\tBusiness people tend to put profit before their humanity. This is just accepted as the way of the world. At most, it makes for some light verbal sparring at the dinner table.\nBut things are different in Liyue, where everyone is involved in business. They reject the notion entirely, claiming that Liyue Harbor is a special place where humanity is sacred.\nForeign merchants will retort that the only thing special about Liyue is that \"They've managed to commodify humanity, too!\" To this, Liyue locals respond, \"Then how do you explain The Crux?\"\nWith The Crux having made a name for itself over many years, its services are extremely expensive to charter. And yet, on one voyage when The Crux encountered a strong storm, Beidou noticed a small private boat nearby. Seeing the way it was tossed about by the waves, she ordered her crew to tow the boat to safety — despite the risk that her ship's keel might give way. What little food and water the fleet had left, Beidou shared with the rescued crew as she navigated her vessel onward through the raging storm.\nFinally, after several days, The Crux delivered the rescued boat to a safe mooring spot. Grateful to Beidou for saving their lives, the crew of the rescued boat became her loyal trade partners thereafter.\nAfter Liyue locals recount this story, they smile and insist, \"When you have someone risking their life like that, you can be sure that it takes far more than commodification to explain their actions! Would you really dare to look Beidou in the eyes and talk about the commodification of humanity?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tWord has it that The Crux's boss behind the curtains is none other than the Qixing's Tianquan, Ningguang, herself.\nBoth of the people involved deny this outright, though they do so for different reasons.\nAs a member of the Qixing, Ningguang often needs someone else to do her dirty work for her. Of the many candidates available, she picked Beidou.\nNingguang would emphasize that she picked Beidou, not The Crux. Ningguang's collaboration with The Crux is, therefore, purely incidental.\nMeanwhile, when Beidou hears the rumors about her dealings with Ningguang, she furiously insists that she collaborates with Ningguang on an equal footing: Beidou is her own boss and no one, not even Ningguang, is sitting in the background pulling the strings for her.\nBeidou is certainly unique among Ningguang's collaborators.\nShe does not tread carefully or show reverence in the way that most of them do. In fact, one could even say Beidou is sometimes at odds with Ningguang.\nNingguang's advisers worry constantly that Beidou is too unpredictable and too much of a maverick. But Ningguang simply smiles and dismisses their concerns.\n\"On the contrary, Beidou is the most reliable person in Liyue,\" she replies. \"Just tell her the truth, as well as what's in it for her, and she'll come around in her own time.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tOnce, after disembarking from a long voyage, The Crux held its customary three-day celebratory banquet. The autumn was like any other before it — except for the new chef in town. This was Xiangling, the head chef-to-be of the Wanmin Restaurant.\nLooking to keep costs down, they lured Xiangling onboard after meeting her on the streets, by hook and by crook. When she saw Beidou, Xiangling was dismayed, and let Beidou know this in no uncertain terms: \"If you want to have Yue-style seafood, then I can't agree to help you. I'll have you know that I intend to transcend Liyue's two warring culinary styles with my cooking...\"\nBeidou merely smiled and gestured to the chest of gold coins beside her: \"Just do what you're good at. We made quite a bit on our last run. How does a retainer of fifty thousand Mora sound?\"\nNot one to shy away for a chance to prove the worth of her cooking, Xiangling took the job.\nWhen the day was done, Beidou was indeed won over by Xiangling's skill. She declared in front of her crew that Xiangling would soon be a renowned chef throughout Liyue. She also insisted that they refer to her as \"Madam Xiangling.\"\nHaving only begun to make her name, Xiangling admired Beidou for her generosity with money and her direct personality. Thereafter, Xiangling would sail with Beidou often, looking for new and exotic seafood ingredients. She found herself surprised by Beidou's vast knowledge of seafood and their culinary preparation, given how far she usually was from any kitchen.\nOf course, that didn't mean Xiangling would necessarily heed Beidou's advice on whether something was edible or not...but that is a story for another time.",
            "Character Story 5\tSome say an object takes after its master.\nThough it may not be a suitable description, The Crux crew does indeed take after Beidou, exhibiting the same qualities.\nHowever, there are still secrets among the crew, spreading in places unnoticed by Beidou.\nHer First Mate always takes new sailors out after their first safe return for drinks and fills them in on the details of an old story:\nIn the past, the crew went on a journey to brave the unknown seas and found itself at death's door in a horrific storm.\nAt that time, Beidou stood on the deck behind the wheel, singing a Liyue fishermen's song in the storm.\n\"...all the way until the waves died down and dawn broke on the far horizon...\"\nThe First Mate often ends the story with this final line and a look of longing on his face.\nAs business grew and the crew expanded, more and more outrageously incredible details were added to the story, making the rookies worship Beidou like a goddess.",
            "Pier Laborers' Gossip\t1. Facing a three-headed hydra of unrivaled girth, Beidou hurled forth her greatsword. Spinning in the air, it sliced clean through all three of the hydra's vertebrae, before returning to her waiting hand.\n2. Beidou has beaten Ningguang at chess. Twice. The important part is not so much that she did win Ningguang's money, but more that she dared to.\n3. Since the day she slew the sea monster Haishan, Beidou has never sung a fishermen's shanty ever again.\n4. Yes, Beidou knows shanties. But don't you dare ask her that to her face. I mean, you know how that hydra ended up, don't you...",
            "Vision\tLiyue and Inazuma share a common saying: \"Its fins formed the ocean deep, its tail the mountains high.\" The fishermen learned this phrase while ashore long ago, and sang it over and over, spreading the tune far and wide till it became the much-loved song people know today. Whenever the mists gather over the sea's surface, one can hear the distant song of the fishermen hidden in the white shroud: \"its fins formed the oceans deep, its tail the mountains high...\"\nThis was Beidou's childhood lullaby. The tale of Rex Lapis smiting the sea monsters had become legendary among the people of Liyue. As a child, Beidou loved tales like this, and in her dreams, she thought: One day, I want to see this big fish too.\nThis day, however, she sang this song with a different emotion in her heart. Her entire crew sang along as they sailed.\nHaishan was in the waters with them — at once like a dragon and a fish, it was larger than any could have imagined in their worst nightmares, and mighty as a deity, raising waves dozens of meters high with ease.\nAll who ply their trade on the high seas are destined to meet Haishan eventually. Beidou had longed to do so since she was nine, dreaming of slicing its head off in a single blow.\nMany times she had challenged the creature, and many times she had failed. But this day was different. This day she charged at Haishan with her best greatsword in hand, and crack sailors at her back.\nThe battle would rage fiercely for four days. With cannons and harpoons, arrows and ropes the fleet would assail Haishan, while Beidou battled the thusly tied-down creature for ten hours, well into the night.\nNow, nighttime was when Haishan was in its element, and in their vigilance not a single member of the fleet dared sleep a wink. Beidou stood upon the prow, listening to the wind.\nOne strike. Just one strike. That was all she needed. And so she waited, unmoving, in the freezing wind.\nThen, at the crack of dawn, having neither eaten nor drank throughout the night, Beidou heard a change in the sound of the waves.\nWith one almighty strike that sounded as if it could have sliced the moon in two or ripped a mountain from the face of the world, she chopped the leviathan's head clean off!\nThe sound of thunder filled the heavens, and a single bolt of purple lightning struck the ocean right in front of Beidou, even as she bathed in the blood of her nemesis.\nThus descended a Vision to the slayer of the sea monster, its violet glow as stunning as lightning, and its immaculate, jeweled form a treasure more precious than dragon blood. A suitably divine gift for the hero who subdued Haishan."

            "Good Afternoon\tI brought a sandwich. You want some? I'll give you hal- *choking* *spluttering* ...Phew. Sorry, nearly choked to death there!",
            "Good Evening\tHey, wanna go talk to my dads for a bit? They tell the best adventure stories!",
            "Good Night\tYou're headed off? Cool. It was awesome adventuring with you. We should totally do it again!",
            "About Bennett: Adventure Team\tI'm the leader of Benny's Adventure Team — a rising star in the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild! ...Where are the others? Ah, haha, they're all on leave right now.",
            "About Bennett: Bad Luck\tEh, it's not as bad as you've heard! Everyone falls into a trapper's pit or gets hit on the head by a falling tree now and then, right?",
            "About Us: Teammates\tHahaha, you wish! Benny's Adventure Team has had no vacancies in ages... I mean, you must be spoiled for choice, right? Why'd you wanna join the unluckiest adventurer alive, anyway?",
            "About Us: Division of Labor\tFrom now on, I'll distract the monsters and set off the traps while you grab the treasure. Sound good? ...You don't like it? Oh — don't worry about me getting injured! It's what I'm best at... And for you, it would be my pleasure!",
            "About Us: Dangerous Places\tI think I get why you teamed up with me now. It's 'cause we're the same, you and I — we both like that adrenaline rush you get from being in dangerous situations. That's what makes adventuring so addictive!",
            "About the Vision\tGetting recognized by the gods was the last thing I expected, seeing as how I'm so unlucky all the time. But if the gods haven't given up on me, I guess that means I shouldn't give up on me either.",
            "Something to Share\tDo you wanna come and see the view of Mondstadt from above some time? It's real pretty at night, when the city's all lit up and you can see the moon reflected on Cider Lake... Huh? From where? Haha, well, there was this one time when I got picked up by a tornado and ended up on this cliff way up high— Not interested? Oh, okay then, never mind.",
            "Interesting Things\tI actually quite like cabbage. It's not much to look at, but you can't imagine a world without it. You can grow it anywhere, it goes with everything, and the flavor never gets in the way. I dunno, there's something... nice about being ordinary.",
            "About Barbara\tShe's the best singer and dancer out there! I always go to watch her in concert after an adventure goes south — it really lifts my mood, chanting along with all the other fans, cheering her on. It's really kinda magical! It's no wonder she's so popular... Boy, if I had even half her popularity as leader of my adventure team...",
            "About Klee\tShe's a cute kid... but I have to keep my distance. Whenever she plays with me, her bombs always end up going off... It's not so much me I'm worried about, it would just be awful if something happened to Klee. The Knights of Favonius would never forgive me, that's for sure.",
            "About Fischl\tOh yeah, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung from the world beyond! She's amazing. I keep asking her if we can go adventuring in her home world together, but each time I bring it up she sort of avoids the topic... She's probably just worried about my safety. Her home world sounds like a dangerous place, for sure.",
            "About Jean\tI keep meaning to ask Master Jean for some help with the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild, but I don't know how to go about it. The Guild doesn't have as many rules and regulations as the Knights of Favonius, the dads and I are pretty laid back about everything. Pretty sure that attitude wouldn't fly with Jean though... I guess I should read up on the Knights' etiquette or something?",
            "About Varka\tHe's my role model! Talk about team leaders — he's the Grand Master! Leads the whole darn Knights of Favonius! How incredible do you have to be to do that!? Recently, though, I've been thinking that having a smaller Adventure Team isn't such a bad thing after all. I mean, if things got too busy in the team, I'd have no time to look after all my dads in the guild, would I? Yeah... Yeah, things are fine the way they are.",
            "About Razor\tWolvendom guy! Looks a little on the feral side... doesn't talk much... but he's alright! We both love eating meat, so we got that in common. I sometimes cook some meat for him, and he teaches me how wolves communicate in return. Haha! You should join us next time!",
            "About Amber\tOh, I know who you mean. The girl who's always charging around all over the place. She's always off adventuring in the wild, just like me... But if you ever see her near a cooking pot, you'll soon find a cloud of thick black smoke blowing in your direction, followed by the smell of burnt steak... Huh, maybe she was born unlucky too?",
            "About Noelle\tNoelle's someone I've been watching for a while. She's really talented, and extremely hardworking. But somehow she's still a maid — the Knights of Favonius still haven't made her a knight. It's a shame, don't you think? Boy, if she switched to the Adventurers' Guild, she'd easily be one of the best there is.",
            "More About Bennett: I\tOh... you wanna know about me? Haha, I'm just your average adventurer. 'Cept I'm more unlucky than average. Anyway, I'm nothing compared to you — you're the star of all those legendary tales. What do I got to show for myself?",
            "More About Bennett: II\t\"The dads...\" That's how I refer to all the older adventurers in Mondstadt. Apparently, I was an orphan kid that they rescued from the most perilous situation ever. How cool is that? I have such terrible luck all the time, and yet I was rescued against the odds and survived all this time. It's a miracle if you ask me.",
            "More About Bennett: III\tYou've, uh, noticed then... Heh. Yeah, Benny's Adventure Team has been me on my own for a long time now. Reason is, I have such bad luck that even the most benign of adventures end up turning into the adventure from hell, and no one wants to come with me... Do you feel the same way?",
            "More About Bennett: IV\tI was born unlucky. That's just the way it is, and I've lived with it so long now that I'm just used to it. But you know what? Maybe it's a good thing. It means I know that whatever luck I do have left is gonna run out sooner rather than later... so I'd better make the most of my life while it lasts. You know, go on plenty of adventures, meet loads of people... I mean, if I didn't live like that, I may never have even met you! Can you imagine? Haha!",
            "More About Bennett: V\tTime flies! We've been a team for a while now, haven't we? Anyway, I have a dream I wanna tell you about. Once the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild becomes the biggest branch in Teyvat, I wanna go adventuring all over the whole world! Benny's Adventure Team will be the greatest adventure team there ever was, because you and me are the greatest adventurers! ...\"Since when?\" Uh... I don't remember exactly when you signed onto Benny's Adventure Team. But whatever, it's just details, right?",
            "Bennett's Hobbies\tI like all kinds of things, but most of all, I like adventures! One day, I'm gonna find the most valuable treasure in the whole world, and then my dads can have a better life... and the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild will be back in business!",
            "Bennett's Troubles\tHmm... Well, if you really wanna know... When I have a bad day, I feel a bit glum. Like, it sucks when I come back empty-handed from an adventure, or when one of my dads' old injuries starts acting up. But... they're just small things, really. After a good night's sleep, I forget all about them. New day, new start! Haha!",
            "Favorite Food\tMeat! Meat is the best sustenance there is. Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, Steaks, and Sweet Madames are all my specialties. You won't go hungry if you come adventuring with me, that's for sure!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tYou can't really afford to be picky as an adventurer. That said, I can't really handle spicy food. I find it hard to breathe after eating Jueyun Chilis, like the spice went right into my lungs. And there's no avoiding the diarrhea afterward... It's the devil's fruit, I say. Who knows where it came from?",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tWhoa, lucky me! Haha... Oh wait! Does that mean I just used all of my good luck for today...?",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tLiterally everything you cook ends up tasting amazing. Hehe, you're awesome!",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tOh no... my stomach hurts...",
            "Birthday\tHappy birthday! Best of luck in the year ahead. Don't worry, bad luck isn't contagious! As long as I'm around, it'll be drawn to me and not you, so you're safe.",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tThanks to your help, I should finally be able to keep everyone safe now. Hopefully, people's opinions of me will start to change. Once the unluckiest guy alive, with a million cuts and bruises to show it. Now, a dependable adventurer at long last! ...Heh, well, I—I can hope.",

            "Character Details\tBenny's Adventure Team is an exception to the norm in the Adventurers' Guild, Mondstadt Branch.\nInitially, the team mechanism requiring at least 3 or 4 regulars in each team was set up to promote mutual support and prevent accidents.\nAs for Benny's Adventure Team, however, its only regular member has been Bennett himself.\nThe lack of team members essentially has everything to do with Bennett's infamous bad luck.\nHowever, being the passionate adventurer he is, Bennett never feels lonely.\nWell, maybe once or twice, sometimes...",
            "Character Story 1\tThe adventurer Jack was the first victim of Benny's Adventure Team.\nJust a few feet away from the treasure, an extremely rare Geo Turbulence occurred, tearing the ground apart and opening a bottomless chasm right before everyone's eyes.\n\"So close, yet so far... like love.\"\nJack only suffered minor injuries, but he was never the same as an adventurer thereafter. The event seemed to have left him with a broken heart.\nAnother member, Royce, heard someone shout \"Heyo!\" before losing consciousness in a huge explosion. The culprit, Klee, was sent to the confinement room for seven days for mistaking the cave the adventurers were still exploring in for a giant rabbit hole and blowing it up.\nHeckler suffered from a severe bout of diarrhea for a week after joining the team. Although it turned out to be food poisoning, he insisted it was because of Bennett's bad luck.\n\"They'll be back! They're just... on leave. Please don't invalidate my team's registration with the Guild...\"\nSeeing Bennett beg and plead before her eyes, Katheryne sighed and decided to spare him the truth that his \"teammates\" had long jumped ship.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere was once a predicament of incomparable despair.\nA predicament that had all but swallowed an old adventurer.\nThe scorching flames scalded his skin, the deafening thunder almost ruptured his eardrums, and the hollering winds threatened to rip his soul from him.\nAt the end of his hellish journey, what awaited him was... a baby.\nThe old adventurer thought he was the first living thing to pass through this arduous ordeal. But how could he explain that which lay before him?\nIn that moment, it hit him, and he believed it to be true.\n\"This baby must be... a child abandoned by the world itself.\"\nThough there were no mighty artifacts, jewelry, or gold, the old man's face did not seem disappointed in the slightest, for he regarded this baby, whose life hung by a mere thread, to be his treasure.\n\"This child is what I was meant to find on this journey,\" he thought as he took the baby into his arms.\nEven if what he was about to do opposed the will of the world itself, he was unafraid.",
            "Character Story 3\tThe old adventurer died from severe injuries before being able to tell this story, leaving only the child he had saved.\nOn his deathbed, he only managed four final words: \"will,\" \"adventure,\" and \"final treasure.\"\nSeveral single, childless, old adventurers in the Adventurers' Guild in Mondstadt raised the child as their own and named him Bennett.\nBeing raised by the Guild, Bennett referred to everyone as \"Dad.\"\n\"Dad, your dentures fell into the bowl!\" \"Dad, you should stop wearing that old leather armor. Where are the undergarments I bought you?\" \"Dad, it's raining, better keep your distance from me so you don't get struck by lightning!\"\nTaking care of all his aging dads who have no family has taken up most of his time outside of adventuring.\n\"The dads certainly have found a treasure, haha!\"\nCyrus, the current Guild Master, laughed, giving Bennett a pat on the back.\nThough he is unlucky himself, he can at least try to bring luck to those he cares about. At least, that's how Bennett feels.\nBennett the Unlucky still strives to find his own lucky treasure through his series of unfortunate events.",
            "Character Story 4\tOz the Raven, Fischl's familiar, said Bennett is \"the most tenacious young man in the world.\"\nIndeed, Bennett's share of bad luck throughout his life can be seen from his scars, old and new.\nAttacked by monsters, buried in collapsed ruins, falling from cliffs... A wealth of \"unfortunate events\" has taught Bennett how to deal with more of them in the future.\nBarbara, the Deaconess at the Church of Favonius, was once surprised by how skilled Bennett is at treating dislocated joints.\nAnother gift from his ordeals is his jaw-dropping talent for combat.\n\"Look at his moves... Doesn't that hurt?\" Grand Master Varka of the Knights was extremely intrigued after seeing Bennett in combat.\nIt's not that Bennett doesn't feel pain — he has simply gotten used to it. He adapted to the pain as others would to pungent smells or blinding light.\nTherefore, the way Bennett dives into battles head-on without reservation has become a signature of his.",
            "Character Story 5\tWhat does death mean, exactly? Always walking the thin line between life and death, Bennett can't help but wonder.\nBennett knows that the old adventurer who saved him has left many praiseworthy stories and legends after his death.\nHe knows that adventurers will not have weeping at their funerals, only toasts made in their names by old comrades.\nHe knows, to the adventurers of Mondstadt, a \"good death\" comes at the end of a life given to the pursuit of treasure and the secrets of the world. Once over, their souls are brought back to their homeland by Barbatos.\nHe once feared death.\nHowever, after pondering on this matter some more, he now feels death may be something fortunate for an adventurer...\nNot that fortune has anything to do with him.\n\"Onto the next treasure!\" And with that, Bennett puts this thinking business behind him.",
            "Adhesive Bandage\tWhenever he suffers severe injuries such as fractures or excessive loss of blood, Bennett will go to the Cathedral to seek treatment from Deaconess Barbara.\n\"Sorry, it's me again...\" Bennett will say, scratching the back of his head.\nBarbara, however, will just shake her head, and with a \"let's deal with those scratches as well,\" she will toss him some adhesive bandages.\nSuch displays of concern may be inadvertent, but they have a special place in Bennett's heart. He sticks those bandages on his wounds with the care of one pinning a medal to their chest, before thanking her wholeheartedly.\nBennett keeps many such bandages in his utility pouch when he goes on adventures. Ones he gets from his dads, from Barbara, from Katheryne... and from adventurers he sometimes meets by chance after getting injured.\nThese tiny tokens of goodwill form a tangible collection of fair fortune unique to Bennett.\n\"Well, since everyone's by my side, I guess I'm not that unlucky after all.\"",
            "Vision\tBennett's passion for adventure is unstoppable.\nHe wants to constantly explore, challenge, sweat it out, and eventually grow old on the adventurer's path.\nBut there was once when he met with a true crisis.\nJust as that old adventurer had so long ago, Bennett was in a predicament that would cause any other person to despair.\n\"Losing this much blood... Not good.\"\nBut Bennett did not stop. \"There's no reason to turn back,\" he thought.\nSomehow, he just knew that all the agonizing misfortune he had suffered up till this point was for the sake of overcoming this precarious position.\nBut at the end of his hellish journey, what he found at the end was — nothing at all.\n\"Ha, returning empty-handed is... part of an adventure. I... don't mind...\"\nAt last, his tightly-wound emotions came loose, allowing his many injuries to rob him of his consciousness, and he collapsed.\nWhen he reawakened, he found that his wounds had been cauterized by a mysterious flame, stopping both the bleeding and the pain.\nA jewel pulsed warmly in the palm of his hand, its rhythm in time with the heartbeat in his chest — the beating heart of an adventurer.\nThis was not the mercy of the world, or that fate took pity on him. Rather, this was his \"final reward,\" one befitting a person with Bennett's burning passion."

            "Candace's Hobbies\tI always love taking walks in the village. Seeing that all is still well gives me a sense that... if today is just like yesterday, and yesterday is just like all the days before it... things have always been pleasant here, throughout history.",
            "Candace's Troubles\tEvery now and then, a few violent thugs make the mistake of trying to disrupt the peace and tranquility of Aaru Village. I do wonder... is chasing them into a monster-infested valley perhaps a little too... merciful? What do you think, do you have any better ideas on how they should be dealt with?",
            "Favorite Food\tTo me... quantity is more important than taste when it comes to food. Life in the desert uses up more energy than you might think. After a day's work, there's nothing more satisfying than having a filling meal.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI don't hate it, but compared to regular meat, eating fish is a real nuisance... Maybe it's because we don't really eat fish here in the desert, but for whatever reason, I'm just not very good at removing all those prickly little bones... This must sound ridiculous to you.",

If it involves going somewhere dangerous, let me join you — I'll be your guard. Or if you're looking to rest and revitalize, come to Aaru Village, and I'll serve you the finest meats and drinks we have.",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tI learned to wield the spear and shield knowing that I would one day need them, and today I use these skills to protect the village. So perhaps this new strength I now gain in the present is preparing me for trials that lie ahead in the future.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tI am now capable of venturing ahead of you, and fending off all dangers that would seek to come your way. If you trust me, then I invite you to close your eyes and leave the enemies to me.",

            "Character Details\tCandace, who has heterochromatic eyes, serves as the guardian of Aaru Village.\nCandace always shows the greatest kindness to all travelers visiting the village, and she will not pursue an inadvertent faux pas so long as that person corrects themselves in time. In Candace's view, the village rules are the most important thing. So long as these boundaries are respected, anyone can be allowed to rest in Aaru Village.\nBut woe betide those who regard this tolerance as weakness. Those who try to do anything illegal in Aaru Village will definitely pay the price.\nBy then, they will find that Candace's lance and shield truly are the most frightening of weapons.\nThe scion of Al-Ahmar, a member of desert folk, the Guardian... Candace, burdened as she is with multiple identities, also bears the eternal responsibility of guarding Aaru Village.\n\"This village only welcomes those who can follow the rules.\"",
            "Character Story 1\t\"Aaru Village is the final refuge for King Deshret's descendants.\" \n\"The mission of the Aaru Village's Guardian is to guard the village till the last of King Deshret's people fade away.\"\nWhen Candace was officially appointed as the new \"Guardian\" at the tender age of eight, the one who handed the position over to her admonished her as such.\nWith King Deshret's death, it was already a blessing that his descendants might have such a refuge from the world.\nAnd so, generation after generation, the Guardians take up their duties in silence, defending countless villagers until they pass on as the \"descendants of King Deshret\" and gain eternal peace.\nIt was once the common wish of the residents of Aaru Village to fade away in peace, sequestered in their village.\nHowever, when new life emerges in this ancient village... Everything that they used to know might just have to change a bit.",
            "Character Story 2\tWhen Uncle Anpu, the village head, announced that a caravan from Sumeru City was about to arrive in the village for trade, the former Guardians could hardly believe their ears.\nThey indignantly accused Uncle Anpu of undermining tradition and requested that Candace, the current Guardian, do her duty by summoning guards to drive the merchants out.\nHowever, Candace refused the request, for she had already reached an agreement with the village head that the village must make changes for the future of its residents.\nThey kept explaining, but the former keepers did not relent, and it was even suggested that if Candace was unwilling to do her duty, they would take up arms again and carry out a Guardian's work themselves. At last, a clang of lance against shield silenced all the quarrels. With lance and shield in her hand, Candace stood up and looked around with a smile, before announcing to the stunned elderly folks around her:\n\"It is good to see you all in such good spirits.\"\n\"But I am the current Guardian of Aaru Village, so please, go and rest, as you should.\"\nThe persuasive power of weapons trumped words at this moment, and it seemed that it would be enough to end the fracas.\nAfter a moment's preparation, Candace accompanied the village head in her station as Guardian to formally receive the caravan and hold trade negotiations with them, before personally escorting them out of the village.\nA few days later, the merchants visited again and completed this seemingly humble transaction regarding cloths.\nThis batch of merchants returned to Sumeru City with news of the success of the deal. Soon after, a new topic cropped up among the business-folk of Sumeru, one which had been rarely heard of in the past:\n\"Hey, you know what? Someone went to Aaru Village to do business — and they made a good sum of Mora, too. Think we should give it a shot next time...?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tIn truth, Candace doesn't often use her lance and shield as debating tools.\nThe children in Aaru Village have always believed that \"Big Sis Candace\" will only frown no matter how angry she is — at most, she might ask the children in trouble to copy the calligraphy prepared for them by Grandma Kulsoom several times.\nThe other guards in Aaru Village believe that although Candace's requirements are strict, she will not give out corporal punishment to those who slack off or whose physical abilities are not up to par, and that she will simply guide them with more care instead.\nThe older folks in the village, for their period, note that Candace is a person who will not let negative emotions show on her face, and indeed, she has never once looked sad in front of them.\nEven the merchants who visit the village will be received by Candace with the utmost hospitality. From introductions to accommodations, she arranges everything in good order.\nPerhaps she might even be too gentle for the merchants' comfort.\nAfter all, this village is next to Great Red Sand. Leaving the monsters aside, lawless bandits must have long had this village in their sights.\nIs the Guardian truly capable of protecting everyone... and their business as well?\nOne night, a drunken merchant dared to ask:\n\"Guardian, we can do business in this village, no problem. But as you know, this desert is a real den of outlaws...\"\n\"You need not worry about this. Only those who obey the rules shall be guests in Aaru Village. As for those who don't...\"",
            "Character Story 4\tThose who do not respect the rules shall be the \"enemies\" of Aaru Village.\nWhether they be Eremites hiding in the sands, bandits disguised as adventurers, or Treasure Hoarders attempting to steal goods... Anyone who dares to invade the village, no matter how they may try to hide and escape, will eventually receive the punishment they deserve.\nThose who sincerely confess their guilt will be forgiven and given enough supplies to cross the sands, but never again will they be permitted to show their faces around Aaru Village.\nAs for the more recalcitrant sort... Their despicable souls shall find company only with the desert sands.\nA former member of the Eremites once warned his companions that Candace, the terrifying Guardian of the village, is a true descendant of King Deshret.\nThe shield in her hand possesses the blessing of Al-Ahmar, such that as long as its wielder holds it tightly, every grain in the great desert will heed her call. So if Candace so wishes, she could even send forth a huge sandstorm to engulf all her foes.\nNot only that, her amber left eye can also perceive the future and read the fates of others. Indeed, such is her terrible might that none can ever escape her pursuit.\nSuch are people's beliefs concerning Candace, that she has swept all of Aaru Village's enemies away by virtue of these divine powers.",
            "Character Story 5\tOnly Candace herself knows that she has never really felt the blessing of Al-Ahmar.\n\"The Guardians have never been blessed by the grace of god\" — this is a secret handed down from Guardian to Guardian.\nOnly when a new Guardian takes up their shield will they be told the truth.\nThe effects of the truth on those now in the know has varied. Some gave up and became so despondent that they stopped practicing martial arts. Some came to believe that since they were not being watched, they didn't have to obey the rules either, and so acted recklessly, even in violation of the law.\nBut Candace was not depressed.\n\"My lance and shield are not wielded as a prayer for a god's blessing.\"\n\"My duty will not change, regardless of whether any god favors us or not.\"\nShe practices diligently day after day and through this has forged both an extraordinary will and martial skills.\nMany who have visited Aaru Village have extended invitations to Candace, wondering why someone as capable as her would choose to live in such an inconspicuous place. If she was willing to leave, they often say, she may yet be able to start a new career...\nYet Candace always answers them thusly:\n\"A Guardian will not leave what they have purposed to protect.\"",
            "Candace's Trinkets\tCandace often buys all kinds of trinkets from merchants who visit Aaru Village.\nHairpins adorned with aquamarine beads, headbands made of silk and satin, gilded necklaces, metal bracelets engraved with Kalpalata Lotus patterns, pendants with the emblems of the Akademiya's Darshans drawn upon them...\nWhile Dehya has encouraged her to dress up more often and use the Mora she spends on herself, Candace feels that some things are too fragile to survive her daily work environment, and so she puts them deep in her wardrobe.\nSo it seems that these trinkets will come in handy only when Candace temporarily puts her duties aside and changes into other clothes to have a rest in the shade — or perhaps she might just give it to a friend as a gift.",
            "Vision\tWith outsiders pouring in, Aaru Village was faced with a variety of unprecedented circumstances.\nThey now had Treasure Hoarders pretending to be businessmen within the village, mercenary groups hijacking trade caravans, unscrupulous vendors engaged in charlatanry...\nMoreover, after seeing people who came from abroad, the residents of Aaru Village gradually began to yearn for life outside. Gradually, people tried to go out to make a living, and fewer and fewer young people were willing to stay in the village.\nThe former Guardians had long been dissatisfied with Candace, who, as they saw it, had \"abandoned\" their traditions. Seeing that the village was in such a situation, they again held a meeting and prepared to challenge her.\n\"What we Guardians must do is maintain order in the village!\"\n\"Candace! What you have done will only cost this village its peace!\"\n\"Candace! Go and fulfill your duties now!\"\nAs the war of words swayed back and forth, the lance-wielding female warrior suddenly shot up to her full height.\n\"That's enough!\"\n\"If you only wish to protect the 'past' of this village, then do it yourself! Whether you wish to just remain in your homes or leave Aaru Village, that is up to you!\"\n\"I will not let the people of Aaru Village be bound by the past forever.\"\n\"If you can't move forward, then it's up to me to protect our future!\"\nThe old Guardians were intimidated by her, her young, fiery eyes making it impossible for them to come forward and question her further.\nBurning with rare anger, Candace hefted her long spear and stormed out of the dispute-ridden hut.\nAnd, as if in response to her convictions, a shining \"jewel\" had appeared at the tip of that lance, though she knew not when it had done so.\nThe eyes of the gods had found her, and they had given her their approval.\nA \"Vision\" is also a resolute heart — and no finer ornament than it may be found anywhere."

            "Chat: News\tIf you keep your eyes peeled and your mind engaged, you'll find there's always a news story nearby just waiting to be discovered.",
            "Chat: Journalists\tThere are lots of journalists in the Court of Fontaine, but not all of them hold themselves to a high professional standard. If you're ever looking to do an interview... I'm your best choice.",
            "Chat: The Steambird\tThe Steambird is an excellent publication. They have many outstanding journalists and the Editor-in-Chief is always open to new ideas. But most importantly, they pay their writers on time.",
            "When It Rains\tUh-oh, I better find a way to keep my Kamera dry!",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tDrat! Missed it again. I never quite manage to get a shot of the lightning strike...",

            "Good Evening\tTime for an evening chat. Any stories you're willing to share? I'd love to hear them. ...Oh, don't worry, I won't print any of them without your permission. You have my word.",
            "Good Night\tGood night. You go get some rest — I gotta head to The Steambird offices to do some final proofreading of some articles. See you tomorrow!",
            "About Charlotte: Career\tPeople aren't always very fond of journalists. You know what they say — lies are soft and malleable, but the truth is sharp and inflexible.",
            "About Charlotte: Photography\tI can't take a good photograph without an interesting subject. I really have to force myself to press the shutter button if I'm not excited by what I'm snapping.",
            "About Us: Exclusive Feature\tAlright, the time has come for your interview. Ready to be a star? Just follow my lead and try to look good for the Kamera! You too, Paimon — you have the power of flight! Could you try to make it look a little more exciting?",
            "About Us: Headliners\tGood news — I've convinced Euphrasie to make you the next headliners of The Steambird! You'll be right up there on the front cover, there'll be a whole feature about you that I wrote myself, and— Huh? What do you mean, \"no need\"? C'mon, I've been pushing Euphrasie for ages on this! Can't you reconsider? I'll make it up to you, I promise! I'll treat you to a huge meal, pleeease?",
            "About the Vision\tTo be honest... I'd prefer to have an Anemo Vision. Being able to fly around freely would make getting to interviews sooo much easier! A Cryo Vision's not too bad, though. At least I don't need to worry about my Kamera overheating.",
            "Something to Share\t\"Your credible source of the unbelievable truth!\" That's my journalistic motto. Hmm? ...Haha, yep, exactly — \"credible\" and \"incredible\" at the same time!

So we have to focus on the most incredible true stories to keep our readers engaged.",
            "Interesting Things\tAllow me to introduce the one and only Monsieur Verite. He's not just any Kamera — he's my trusty companion and assistant. See his little hat and bow tie? I had those custom made by Chiori. Pretty neat, huh? I've got loads of other outfits for him too, all in different styles. He comes dressed to impress for every interview, whatever the occasion!",
            "About Navia\tNow that her father's name's been cleared, and the case of the serial disappearances of young women is resolved, I guess Navia must be able to finally breathe a little easier. I don't know why, but somehow, she's found herself at the epicenter of all sorts of bad news lately... Luckily for her, I've been snatching up all the articles that mention her and doing whatever damage control I can before they get published. Heh, and uh... then getting told off constantly by Euphrasie for interfering... But y'know, I think Navia deserves a break, so I'm happy to take one for the team. Also, she agreed to do an in-depth exclusive interview, which definitely sweetens the deal!",
            "About Lyney\tSurprise, surprise — Lyney refused an interview with me once again. Do you know how many times that is now? ...Uh, actually, I've lost count. But never mind! Evading me only further confirms my suspicion that he's hiding the news story of a lifetime! As long as I keep digging, I'll find it — and when I do, it will shake the world like no other news report in history!",
            "About Lynette\tNo matter what question you pose to her, Lynette just calmly lowers her eyes with an expressionless look on her face. It's like she's some sort of... clockwork doll. I'm really tempted to write an article titled something like: \"The Genius Magician's Puppet Assistant: Magic's Best-Kept Secret\"... but I have a sneaking suspicion that even that wouldn't get a reaction out of her.",
            "About Clorinde\tClorinde is the most well-known Champion Duelist in Fontaine, but she's also the most mysterious. I have a source who tells me that she uses some sort of mystical ritual to keep her weapon as good as new... Could this be the secret behind her famously undefeated track record in the Duelists' Ring? Ah, I'd love to spring that question on her one day... but I don't think I'll get the chance. She's publicly stated that she doesn't accept interviews.",
            "About Wriothesley\tSo... Did you get to meet the Duke in person? Yeah? Any nuggets of information that I should know about? Never mind the Credit Coupons, the Coupon Cafeteria, \"If a man will not work, he shall not eat\"... That's all just generic filler. I'm talking about personal anecdotes about the man of Meropide himself... What do you mean, \"confidentiality\"? Aw, not you, too! We had a deal! That does it — remember that gigantic feast I treated you to? I want my money back! Get your butts back to prison and do your time, you swindlers, you!",
            "About Emilie\tEmilie makes the best perfume in the whole Court of Fontaine. She introduced me to this amazing one the other day that works as an insect repellent, anti-perspirant, and deodorant all in one! It's a total life-saver for someone like me who spends so much time zooming around all over the place. I actually sprayed some on my wrist today... Go on, take a whiff, it's heavenly!",
            "About Chiori\tI did a little snooping around at Chioriya Boutique once. Aside from the wealthy housewives of Fontaine and the box-ticking tourists from overseas, some of the regular customers there look like really rough characters! Big muscly types with scars on their face, guys in masks and hats with their swords drawn... But they always come bearing gifts and acting like humble servants. Uh... Well, mostly. Anyone with a bad attitude is literally sent flying back out the door. Seriously! I snapped a photo of a guy being thrown out once, he was like four feet in the air!",
            "About Freminet\tI've met Freminet a few times since being introduced. He quickly took an interest in Monsieur Verite — that's my Kamera-slash-assistant — and even made a few improvements to my lenses. I gotta say, though, my heart was in my mouth watching him completely dismantle Monsieur Verite in a matter of seconds... Amazing he managed to reassemble it just as swiftly. He seems very experienced — I was convinced he must have graduated from the Fontaine Research Institute, but he denied it.",
            "About Neuvillette\tIf you want to interview the Iudex, you have to provide all the interview questions in advance and get them reviewed by the relevant department at the Palais Mermonia, who decide which questions to approve and which ones you're not allowed to ask... It's their way of making sure the interview goes off without a hitch. It's such a rigmarole. I'm losing the will to live just talking about it.",
            "About Furina\tLady Furina has a very captivating presence. She was born to be a star. Euphrasie once assigned a journalist to shadow her, but he quit not long into the assignment... From what I've heard, the reason he left was that Furina insisted on seeing every photo he took of her right away, and she'd make him redo it if she wasn't happy with how it turned out. Apparently, she was so picky that the poor guy once had to take 127 shots of her in the same pose before she was content...",
            "More About Charlotte: I\tI'm well aware that following the truth wherever it leads is risky business. But buried truths make exclusive news, so good luck trying to keep secrets from me when we need a good story... telling journalist like me in this world with a strong sense of journalistic integrity! Ahem! I make it my goal to provide the public with only the best exclusive news, through powerful, engaging, and honest reporting!",
            "More About Charlotte: II\tWhen I first started working as a journalist, I didn't know anything about how to write the news, so I had to figure it all out for myself by reading articles by other people. As well as The Steambird, I also looked at some other independent publications out there, which tend to be more specialized. For example, there's \"The Observer\" for celebrity gossip, \"Leisure Weekly,\" which focuses on competitive sport and other entertainment news, \"Top Chef\" for those who like to read... all the food critiques in one place, and \"Bedazzled!\" which is just sort of a glorified rumor and speculation mill. I learned a whole lot from reading all those papers. Or... Well, I at least learned how to master a bunch of different writing styles.",
            "More About Charlotte: III\tI once spent six months working undercover for an exposé piece about a merchant who was selling shoddy food products. I disguised myself as a vagrant, infiltrated the back kitchen, took a job as a kitchen hand, and stuck around until I'd gathered enough solid evidence about their misdeeds. Then, I put it all in an article and had it published in the paper. The backlash was intense. They were punished for their crimes, sure, but that didn't stop them from launching a vicious campaign of vengeance against me almost immediately. I was coming home to threat letters sitting on my bedside table on a daily basis, and we'd also find mud slung on the front door to our office... The Steambird quickly filed a report to the Gardes, and I was sent to Mondstadt to report on Genius Invokation TCG. It took a while before I could safely return to Fontaine. These kind of things happen all the time. I honestly don't know Euphrasie deals with it...",
            "More About Charlotte: IV\tI've always been a very curious person. Even as a kid, long before I ever thought about going into journalism, I was always convinced that secrets and mysteries were lurking in every corner... To me, the world is a giant hoard of hidden treasure, with countless stories waiting to be uncovered. Every time I see something where I think a secret might be hiding, I snap a photo with my Kamera and add it to my collection. These photos are like my own personal treasure map... and I'm constantly going back to them, trying new ways to decipher them and expose the truth.",
            "More About Charlotte: V\tI don't really care whether these hidden truths are significant, what they mean, or what the wider ramifications are... I just want to bring them into the light of day. To put it in adventurer terms, I guess for me... it's all about the thrill of the chase, and not the treasure at the end. I've also met a lot of people along the way: all my Fontaine friends, Euphrasie, who believes I was born to be a journalist, and people like you, who join me in the search for the truth. Without everyone's help, I'd probably still be that nosy kid who runs around furiously snapping photos like a lunatic... Anywho... It's not often that I get to be the interviewee, but... this has been a real pleasure.",
            "Charlotte's Hobbies\tI love collecting different Kamera lenses. They all have different strengths — some might have an incredible range of focal lengths, others might have a really wide field of view. Oh, and there's also more novelty ones that can apply special effects to the image. Take this one, for example — when you take a portrait photo with this, it turns their face all chubby... C'mon, I'll take one of you! And you, Paimon!",
            "Charlotte's Troubles\tI've ended up with a less-than-favorable reputation in some people's eyes — I think it's because I can sometimes be a little bit, um... intense in interviews. Now, whenever I show up to interview someone, they're always really wary of me... *sigh* But in my defense, with some people, you really have to put the pressure on or they won't open up...",
            "Favorite Food\tHehe, sweet things are my weakness. However big the main meal, I can always manage a dessert or several. Or as my mother puts it... There's always a special place reserved in my stomach for dessert!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tSpicy food doesn't agree with me at all. It's like my stomach is fitted with a super-sensitive spice detector or something, 'cause even the mildest hint of chili will set it off. One small bite and the stomachache begins... and it always lasts for like an entire day, ugh...",

            "Character Details\tIn the Court of Fontaine, a new \"story\" is born every minute.\nFor example, Romaritime Harbor might suddenly swell with new ships, crewed by sailors of obviously non-Fontainian origin. Some fishmonger in Poisson might suddenly buy three months' worth of fish in a single month, or countless flyers boasting of a certain place where especially delicious fish can be found might suddenly appear in the Court...\nIn the eyes of a mediocre reporter or ordinary city folk, these are \"independent\" tales, just like there will always be waves rippling across the sea's surface — such ordinary events are barely worth paying attention to at all.\nClumsier journalists might even chase these waves, and dispiritedly end up merely following the wave's patterns, constantly pumping out \"surface-level stories\" of little interest.\nBut in Charlotte's eyes, these waves are but the superficial representation of other forces. What is causing them to crest and break? That is the story she seeks.\nPerhaps it is the wild winds wailing over the surface, or perhaps they are due to the Thalatta Submarine Canyon's complex seabed topography. Of course, you can't rule out the possibility of tremors from the Elton Trench either...\nThese stories are the \"deep dives\" Charlotte desires.\nA reporter should be an agile \"seeker\" — not a mere gauche \"recorder.\"\nThis, then, is Charlotte's \"work doctrine.\"\nAs to how she avoids being swept up in her \"deep dives\"... well, that's up to Euphrasie and her fellow citizens!",
            "Character Story 1\tCharlotte was fascinated with the world around her from a young age.\nThe first Rainbow Rose that bloomed in the yard come spring, exceeding all others in vibrance. The children gladly padding about in puddles on the leaf-strewn streets after a storm and their hapless laughing families. The beauty of a solitary shell on the seashore, and the tiny crab surveying the world from underneath. The Blubber Profiterole she had with her family on her birthday, and the ever-so-slightly-too-deep color of the cream...\nTo most, a flower is a flower, a shell is a shell, and a Profiterole is still a Profiterole even if it is a bit too sweet — that's just how the world is.\nBut to Charlotte, these hidden \"details\" — only visible out of the corners of her eyes — are essential to understanding the world.\nCharlotte's father, a seasoned reporter and professional nature photographer, noticed his daughter's interest in and knack for \"observation.\" Thus, on her tenth birthday, he gave her a custom-made Kamera, its dimensions and the positions of its buttons built specially for her.\n\"Not all people are attentive enough to seek out and observe subtle differences, but this, Charlotte, is your unique talent.\"\nThose were the words of her father, the \"Reporter of the Idylls,\" Galanopoulo.\nFrom then on, there was a little junior reporter by the senior reporter's side. This father-daughter tag team could be found on streets wide and narrow, forests and rivers alike, raising two Kameras, one large and one small, taking countless still images of moving beauty.\nEven though their \"interviews\" always caused the gentle yet strict Mrs. Gagnepetit to nag them incessantly, Charlotte's laughter never failed to be the quickest way to make her mother stop. And as for her soiled clothes and dirtied hat, those were left to the ever-capable Mr. Galanopoulo.\nTo her, the whole world is a giant treasure trove.\nAnd those pictures, for their part, are her special treasure maps.",
            "Character Story 2\tGalanopoulo always emphasized one thing to Charlotte:\n\"A picture of sufficiently great beauty cannot be ignored.\"\nWith her consent, he sent the photos they'd taken to The Steambird. The editors were quickly taken with their photos — especially Charlotte's — and profusely praised Galanopoulo's ever-improving photography skills, reserving, just as before, prime placement for them in their publication.\nThose pictures caused quite a stir in the Fontainian photography space when they were published, with critics stumbling over each other to flatter them, and newspaper hobbyists fighting to get copies to make their clipping collections yet more colorful and vivid.\nBut when both critics or fellow journalists came calling and asked how Galanopoulo advanced his aesthetic sensibilities by leaps and bounds...\nThe veteran reporter lightly pushed Charlotte forward, saying calmly: \"Ah, such pictures are beyond me. It's all my daughter's handiwork!\"\nThe experienced, learned ladies and gentlemen who had come knocking could not but fall silent first, before expressing surprise, and then beginning to whisper amongst themselves and even venturing a few questions.\nCharlotte blinked. The bewildered adults before her seemed every bit like little insects searching for shelter in a storm, waving their antennae this way and that, crying \"Where are the leaves? Where are the leaves?\"\n\"Hey, everyone, look this way!\"\nThe young child's cry caused them to collectively leap out of their worn skins, and everyone turned to look, only to be greeted by a custom-made Kamera and the click of a shutter.\nIn that moment, all of it was captured on film — the furrowed brows, quirked lips, red faces, tangled hair, and waving arms, perfectly encapsulating those panicked bugs in the storm.\nThe little reporter patted her Kamera and smiled toothily.\n\"I'll call this one... 'No, No, That Won't Do!'\"",
            "Character Story 3\tAfter Charlotte's extraordinary photography skills had made her famous, she began receiving frequent visits from manuscript writers, magazine editors, news clipping collectors, and her father's reporter colleagues. Even Euphrasie, the Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird, was amongst them.\nEuphrasie was straightforward about her intent. She hoped that Charlotte would agree to become a \"special correspondent\" — someone who would conduct interviews and write articles in addition to taking photographs.\n...However, her father, despite his usual mild temperament, was strongly against it. He did not wish for his daughter to associate with those kinds of people, either full of ulterior motives or hypocrites.\n\"Nature is fierce, but it is honest. Storms don't loose their fury without reason, nor do beasts bare their fangs without cause.\"\n\"But people lie — they always do. A Kamera can only capture their faces, but the lens cannot target their hearts.\"\nHe would respect Charlotte's decision, of course, but he preferred that Charlotte live a simpler, happier life, without sinking into the morass of humanity.\nTo Charlotte, this world was a treasure trove, and pictures her treasure maps.\nBut for the first time, she came to realize that this trove still harbored undiscovered \"truths.\"\nThese truths were not themselves treasures, but were more akin to a procession of dark memories. Intentionally hidden, discarded, disguised, and then abandoned, with those having done so wishing that they would never be discovered, and that all events connected to them would simply end right there.\nCharlotte knew that she could find them. She could dig up these truths, like digging tulip bulbs in a garden, like leading hermit crabs out of their shells, like finding pinecones hidden by squirrels.\n...But she also felt like a bird glimpsing an onrushing flash flood, a cave rat foreseeing an earthquake, or a fish sensing a coming tsunami.\nWith great ability comes great responsibility.\nOne with the talent for uncovering \"truth\" was also responsible for bringing the \"truth\" to light.\nThe only question was, did she have the courage to do so?\nHer parents responded with silence, for they knew that their daughter had already made her choice. Charlotte was old enough, and all birds are destined to spread their wings and leave the nest someday.\nThe next morning, Euphrasie went to work as usual, and there, waiting for her at the entrance to The Steambird, she saw Charlotte, ready with her Kamera and notepad.\n\"Welcome to The Steambird, Charlotte.\"\nEuphrasie extended a hand.\n\"I believe the next La Verite Prize is yours to win.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tThe La Verite Prize, established and funded by The Steambird, is the most prestigious prize a Fontainian reporter can win.\nOnly the best of the best have ever won it: Hirailles and her tireless reporting on the investigative work of the Maison Gardiennage, the solitary Hobereau and his marine life photography honed over decades living by the sea, and of course, Dieuleveux, famed for his unbending, straight-talking nature, to the point where all threats and criticism simply bounced off his hide, never causing his quill to waver in the slightest.\nAnd of course, the renowned genius reporter, Charlotte, has long since joined their storied number. In fact, her reporting stands out so far above the rest that she has won the prize several times in a row.\nCritics have lavished her with praise, lauding her \"unequaled sense of composition,\" \"incomparably fresh angles,\" \"unquestionable impartiality,\" and \"unparalleled flair\"...\nDetractors, on the other hand, believe that her successive triumphs are the result of collusion between The Steambird and the prize selection committee. How could such a young and unorthodox reporter be showered with glory, if not so the newspaper employing her could also bask in that glow? And why else would she be so close to the committee members, anyway?\nEven so, her talents are beyond doubt. As another round of selection for the La Verite prize drew near, all her colleagues believed that she was guaranteed to emerge victorious once again.\nThey'd seen how she infiltrated the haunts of criminal rings alone and secretly visited illegal sweatshops... For report after report, Charlotte had braved unspeakable dangers and endured unimaginable hardships to bring the truth to readers... Whether it be in her professional dedication to the profession, her masterful manuscripts, or her attitude toward reporting, Charlotte was worthy of the committee's favor.\nThe question on everyone's minds, really — especially those of the sponsors — was \"Which one of her reports will she submit to the committee?\"\nIt would, after all, be her ticket to the La Verite Prize, and that would make it a collectors' item of... considerable value, surely.\nBut to everyone's astonishment, Charlotte unexpectedly declared that her submission would be a brand-new, never-before-published report, one that would reveal some heretofore unrivaled \"truth.\"\nDear readers, to find out, please subscribe to The Steambird and look out for tomorrow's headline!",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Prestige Prize Proved Perniciously Partial — The Real La Verite.\"\nThis was the headline on the day the award was to be announced.\nIn it, Charlotte detailed the various monetary dealings that the long-serving members of the La Verite Award selection committee had engaged in over the previous decade, various inequities in their judgments, and provided an exhaustive list of reporters and reports who had been done dirty in the process.\nHer report caused an uproar in the Court of Fontaine, with countless reporters surging to the committee offices — Charlotte, of course, among them.\nAmidst a broadside of shutter clicks, Charlotte unleashed a barrage of meticulously-prepared questions from a thick notebook at the dumbstruck committee members, one after another. Red and shame-faced, the gentlemen flapped their clumsy lips as best they could, only to produce explications akin to porous cheese. In the end, they had to declare the questions out of order and in violation of normal procedure, before fleeing right before the gathered reporters' eyes.\nCharlotte's \"report\" had barely begun, though.\nShe continued publishing articles concerning the La Verite Award in The Steambird, even directing her pen against certain figures in the newspaper itself who had been connected to the La Verite selection committee, laying out the manner in which they had recommended reporters with whom they shared beneficial arrangements for awards, and how those reporters had returned the favors...\nCharlotte's articles swept through the Fontainian media world like a tidal wave, and in response to public outcry, the Maison Gardiennage declared an official inquiry into the Award, suspending its activities and investigating all suspicious awardees.\nCharlotte, for her part, temporarily lived inside The Steambird's offices, with all prospective visitors \"wanting a word with her\" being turned away by Euphrasie with extreme prejudice. It reached the point where the Maison Gardiennage even dispatched a guard detail to the newspaper's office entrance.\nWith her own hand Charlotte had lifted a huge stone that none had wanted to peek under, and the creepy crawlies that had lurked in its cracks and crevices now had to face the searing sunlight of the \"truth.\"\nThe Maison Gardiennage's investigation concluded three months later. Judges who had given unjust judgment, contestants who had contended to win glory undeserved, and editors who sought to edify themselves all received their just deserts.\nThe La Verite Award selection committee was also wholly reorganized, now under various forms of new oversight. Once this was complete, the first thing they did was to give Charlotte the now utterly discredited award.\nOf course, the trophy was but dead dross to her.\nThe real honor she had received was that the \"truth\" she had revealed in her report — and the ones that followed in its wake, of course — now shone in the sun.",
            "\"Monsieur Verite\"\tA gift to Charlotte from her father that she carries with her to this day.\nThough he still didn't wish for her to take on such complicated work, her father respected her decision to formally accept the job of being a special correspondent for The Steambird.\nHe commissioned a friend skilled with machinery and modifying Kameras, and made extensive modifications to that small Kamera.\nFor example: Making it easier to switch out the film canisters such that Charlotte could swap film with only one hand, or making the photographic compartment water, fire, impact, and explosion-proof, to the point that the Kamera's exterior casing could be utterly destroyed, yet the compartment containing the film would remain intact and unharmed...\nHer father insisted on numerous modifications to which his friend initially opined, \"This isn't necessary, is it...?\" with a bitter smile. Nevertheless, in the end they agreed to make the modifications, including a high-powered loudspeaker that, when activated, unleashed an ear-splitting alarm, as well as a hidden self-defense system on the Kamera's side that ejected a concealed knife outward at high speed when the right button was pressed...\nThey also included \"a shutter delay device,\" a \"lens self-coupling setup,\" and more...\nAll the concerns and worries of her father were installed into the device along with all manner of contraptions, transforming it into an ever-reliable, unequaled super Kamera that reflected its owner perfectly.\nAnd when the modifications were finished, Charlotte gave it a new name — \"Verite.\"\nMeaning, of course, \"truth.\"",
            "Vision\tCharlotte does not, in fact, really know just when she obtained her Vision.\nPreviously, she had been penning a new piece about problems in how salvage divers were treated, and had gone to interview Dollander, who employed a great number of said divers. The chubby-faced man did not seem keen on speaking the truth, and indeed was only interested in answering any questions insofar as he might redirect them. The divers he employed, too, proved quite tight-lipped.\nDespite the serious damage that had been done to their lungs and eardrums, the long work hours exhausting them utterly, the decrepit divesuits they used, and the inedible food, they held their silence in front of Dollander. Their smug boss smiled triumphantly at her lack of progress.\nBy the next day, Charlotte had procured a divesuit through personal connections and was ready to get close to the divers in secret as they worked, and use her Kamera to capture Dollander's ill-treatment of them firsthand. They were in a titanic undersea rift, a place where it was completely forbidden to work according to Fontainian diving regulations.\nAfter that, Charlotte did not appear at work for a good long while. All the other Steambird reporters saw was a stream of Maison Gardiennage officers coming in and out of the office, with Euphrasie uncharacteristically ruffled, working late into the night every day.\nSome reporters said that they saw someone dressed in outmoded clothes, drenched and shivering as they squatted at the office entrance.\nSome said that an undersea earthquake had occurred in the Thalatta Submarine Canyon, where divers employed by some fellow named Dollander had been working, and that they had avoided injury by the skin of their teeth.\nSome other reporters even said that this Dollander had secretly put out a bounty for a Kamera that was said to contain pictures important to him.\nStill, Charlotte did not emerge.\nBut reporters are most certainly not a passive lot. The Steambird's reporters began to act quietly and surreptitiously. Some utilized their personal connections to look into Dollander's business, while others followed the divers, and others still wrote pieces implicating Dollander...\nWith The Steambird working at full steam, it was fearsomely quick indeed, and before long an extensive report on Dollander's illicit employment practices was complete.\nHowever, without any photographic evidence to corroborate the article, the reporters felt it was...\nJust then, the doors to the main entrance were suddenly flung wide open, and in strode Charlotte, clad in rags and sans spectacles and shoes. Placing Monsieur Verite on the table, she grinned.\n\"I have the pictures right here!\"\nNo questions were asked about what she'd been through. Instead, all worked as one, focusing on slotting each image into the report.\nThe next day, The Steambird headline was this — \"Dollander: Undersea Scrooge,\" detailing his illegal employment practices, salary deductions, the harm done to the health of his employees, and other vile conduct. As for the article's author, it was listed as \"The Steambird Reporters.\"\nThe night before that edition was to be published, Charlotte was, as always, in the printing room doing some final proofreading work.\nWhen she finished reading the final word and put the manuscript down, she suddenly noticed that an icy-blue Vision had appeared beside her hand.\nScrutinizing it, all she could manage was to mumble a few words:\n\"I think we'll have to leave out this little detail...\""

I heard that an author actually used that case as the basis for their mystery novel about a magician who used their craft to commit crimes.\nUnfortunately... the author ended up going a little overboard on the graphic detail, and since the crime is still fresh in everyone's minds, it'll be a while before they're able to get it published.",

            "Character Details\tIn the Court of Fontaine, where the corpus juris is exceedingly well-developed — some might even say convoluted — there are many odd ordinances that can confound and confuse foreign tourists.\nFor example, fruit tarts may not be placed directly on unheated platters, unfinished Fonta may not be intentionally placed in the middle of roads, and one must not forget to trim the claws of pet felines...\nViolations are thus difficult to avoid. But Fontainians are quite familiar with such matters, quickly ascertaining the gravity of an offense and deciding on a course of action based on the identity of the one sent to deal with the matter.\nIf it is only a member of the establishment's staff, then perhaps a simple debate will be sufficient to resolve the issue; who doesn't enjoy a lively atmosphere? If it is a uniformed Gestionnaire, then all onlookers will have to suffer through an insufferably long-winded admonishment, and it's best to vacate the premises. If it is an officer of the Maison Gardiennage, then the parties involved won't get off scot-free, and may even have to pay fines. In this case, it's best to immediately clarify that you are an innocent bystander, and are in no way involved with the case.\nHowever, if the one to come calling is the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol with her tall cap and musket slung across her back, along with a squad of Special Patrol officers...\nWell, that means a particularly vicious case is unfolding, or perhaps a hoodlum is to be violently apprehended, or some fiendish felon has kidnapped a hostage... In any case, the only thing to do in such a situation is to quickly evacuate in accordance with the instructions given by the Special Patrol and give these \"Felon Management Specialists\" room to work their magic. At the same time, keep a tight leash on your curiosity and do not attempt to conceal yourself in a nearby hidey-hole. seeking to observe their law-enforcement activities from a close distance. Even if you wish to interview them, then wait until their work is done.\nMost importantly, there's no need to feel unsafe, and even less cause for fear.\nFor as all Fontainians know, any hope criminals have to escape the long arm of the law flees whenever Captain Chevreuse is on the scene.",
            "Character Story 1\t\"If you don't behave, the Special Patrol's going to take you away!\"\nSuch is the start of many a scolding given by Fontainian parents to a troublemaking child.\nChildren who have grown up with such threats from their parents, understand very clearly that the Special Patrol will never take action because a child didn't brush their teeth, slept in, broke a window, or swiped a slice of cake. Still, though they have long since matured into adults, they cannot help but stand up a bit straighter when they see Captain Chevreuse, averting their gaze and instinctually wringing their hands, mortally afraid that they might have committed some offense worthy of arrest without having even been aware of the nature of their crime. Yet despite being crystal clear that these fine officers are fighting crime, and regardless of their reverence for such upstanding upholders of the law, it is truly difficult to suppress the urge to tense up...\nAs for this \"fearsome, infamous reputation,\" the Special Patrol themselves are quite exasperated. A member once suggested to Chevreuse that allowing such an \"infamous reputation\" to circulate is damaging to the Special Patrol's image: \"The Special Patrol is an official law enforcement office under the Maison Gardiennage, after all, and if our methods of enforcing the law are more forceful, and the process thereof more intense, it's only because the criminals we deal with are the most vile and violent of them all. So to use the Special Patrol's good name to frighten children really is a bit...\"\n\"Why not let Chevreuse give The Steambird an interview? Let our Captain stress that the Special Patrol is a law enforcement organization only focused on dealing with the worst offenders, and everything it does is to safeguard Fontaine's safety and stability, in pursuit of which it would never accost citizens without good cause...\"\nYet Chevreuse vetoed this suggestion.\n\"If such a reputation has really become so deeply embedded in the minds of the people, and it sticks with them for a lifetime, then there's a chance that when someone considers taking things a step too far, fear inspired by our 'infamous reputation' may pull them back from the edge.\"\n\"...If so, then there'll be no need for us to actually take them away someday.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tAs one of the departments central to upholding the binding nature of Fontaine's laws and decrees, the \"Court of Fontaine Grand Maison Gardiennage\" is a solemn and dignified institution, and all law enforcement personnel must undergo rigorous examinations and instruction. Their every word and action reflects on the Maison Gardiennage, and represents the laws of the Court of Fontaine, so there is zero room for errors or negligence.\nHowever, the way the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol of the Court of Fontaine does things is markedly different from other law enforcement agencies. Members are not required to use standardized weapons, nor must they wear uniforms outside of formal occasions... Additionally, after Chevreuse took command of the Special Patrol, many of its members began using muskets as part of their law enforcement arsenals, and some even began to refuse to go on missions with Gardemeks on the basis that not only can an immobile meka block their line of fire, but there's a distinct danger of criminals taking control of said meka and turning them against the squad. Furthermore, when selecting recruits, the Special Patrol will even accept the descendants of criminals whose households had been stripped of all honor...\nFor the sake of quickly solving the most heinous of cases, the Maison Gardiennage is willing to overlook all those issues, displaying great forbearance towards Chevreuse and the Special Patrol. But what they simply cannot abide is how Chevreuse is willing to invite serious felons to participate in cases she is handling as \"special consultants.\"\nThough Chevreuse stridently maintains that this is purely to catch vicious criminals as soon as possible, many colleagues still believe that relying on lawbreakers to help arrest lawbreakers is an insult to both the laws of Fontaine and those who enforce them. Should such humiliations continue, what dignity would remain for the Maison Gardiennage and the law itself?\nFaced with such pointed questions, Chevreuse always gives the same simple response:\n\"The greatest insult to the law is a criminal roaming free and unpunished.\"\n\"And as for the 'dignity' of the Maison Gardiennage, it isn't even worthy of comparison with the safety of the Court of Fontaine.\"\nThis, too, is one of her father's teachings.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"Monsieur Donatello is an upstanding officer of the law.\"\nWhen Chevreuse discusses her father with others, she always offers this simple, curt evaluation. This is also one of the only two impressions she has of her father from her childhood.\nDonatello was always busy, leaving hurriedly in the mornings and returning exhausted at night before giving Chevreuse and her mother a hug, gently apologizing for making them wait so long. Sometimes he would return exceptionally late, bringing his daughter sweet treats. Alas, having long since already brushed her teeth, it was also too late for her to have any more sugar.\nSuch gifts were a rare treat, and yet their luster would fade by morning, and so Chevreuse's mother would allow little Chevreuse to lick a bit of cream off before sending said dessert to her father's bedroom along with a cup of coffee.\nAt this time, her father would always be facing a wall covered in pictures and thumbtacks, at times staring blankly at it, at others pacing in circles, smoking, tousling his hair, and sometimes raising his fists in sudden triumph, before slowly lowering them and helplessly pounding the table— Chevreuse bore silent witness to all this, peeping in from behind the door.\nSometimes, when she ran into her father on the street, she would excitedly wave, but at most he would return a slight smile before throwing himself back into his myriad tasks.\n\"He's an upright, good man.\"\nHer mother, neighbors, his colleagues, and even the kids next door all praised her father thusly.\nBut one day, those colleagues who were always praising her father as an upstanding man suddenly came knocking at her door.\nHer mother was at a complete loss as she watched them come and go from her home. Though Chevreuse stayed in her room, from the commotion outside her door, she had already vaguely guessed that her father had become a \"sinner\" like those he had once pursued, and was at that moment awaiting sentencing, and might even be banished to the Fortress of Meropide.\n\"Did Papa... do something wrong?\"\nThis was the question she asked the strange adults beside her. After much choking back of tears, the reply finally came:\n\"...Nonetheless, he is an upstanding officer of the law.\"\nAn upstanding sinner.\nThis became Chevreuse's second impression of her father from her childhood.",
            "Character Story 4\tEven the most acclaimed authors of Fontaine would struggle to explain to a child why a suspect to whom all the evidence clearly pointed could not be convicted. Why everyone maintained their silence as an innocent officer of the law was falsely accused. Why many who witnessed the crime refused to speak the truth. And why the victim of the miscarriage of justice must pay with their own reputation and future for justice to finally make an appearance.\nEven harder to explain is why the path to justice must be paved with crime.\nBut for Chevreuse, what was most concrete were the changes in her life wrought by her entire family moving to the Fleuve Cendre.\nA narrow room, the food less tasty, friends who now never contacted her, and a mother growing more fatigued by the day... Her father's colleagues often came by in plainclothes, bringing all kinds of gifts with them. In addition to their presents, they brought news as well. They told her mother of the appeal they were all working so hard on — not just the Gardes and the members of the Special Patrol, but even several Gestionnaires who oft worked with them — and how despite the fact Donatello had broken the law was indisputable and established fact, and legally speaking his sentence could not be commuted or shortened, they at least could ensure he didn't need to endure further castigation. It was all of scant comfort to her mother, whose worries did not subside.\nTo take care of her mother, Chevreuse didn't hesitate to take up burdens that one as young as she should never have had to shoulder, stepping into the dark currents that swirled through the Fleuve Cendre.\nPerhaps it was because the residents of the Fleuve Cendre had heard tell of or been on the receiving end of her upright father's care that so many helping hands were extended to her. A well-meaning shop owner gave her a job, and the couple next door often took care of her infirm mother.\nAnd when the children of the Fleuve Cendre heard that the child of a Garde had come to live among them, they flocked to her like plaintiffs and defendants, seeking her arbitration on all manner of quarrels and disputes.\n\"Chevreuse! You gotta uphold justice, y'know!\"\nSo cried the children with one voice, before laughing as one. They did not truly intend to allow Chevreuse to determine who was at fault, but rather saw it all as merely another game.\nYet the next day, Chevreuse brought a thick stack of legal materials when she went to see them, along with a notebook newly opened to the first page, and began speaking to the chortling children in a tone most serious.\n\"Very well. Let both sides present their evidence.\"\nAnd from that day forward, the Fleuve Cendre had one more enforcer of the law — the littlest one around. But unlike the law enforcement officers aboveground, all judgments rendered by Chevreuse were executed under her personal supervision.\nThere in the sewers, she learned many ways to ensure that \"justice\" would be upheld.",
            "Character Story 5\t\"...Then, Ms. Chevreuse, in accordance with the findings of this court, your father did indeed violate the regulations of the Gardes, leaking secret intelligence regarding a serious case, and for this reason, he was exiled to the Fortress of Meropide.\"\n\"From that moment onward, you followed your mother and moved to the Fleuve Cendre... As for your father's charges, and your experiences while living in the Fleuve Cendre, please provide a supplementary statement for this court.\"\n\"Regarding my experiences living in the Fleuve Cendre, my statement is as follows...\"\nHer father, Donatello, exiled for violating the law. Her poverty-stricken family forced to move to the Fleuve Cendre. A child of a sinner, unable to work for the Maison Gardiennage, and thus seeking to fight crime as a member of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol...\nAs the Captain of the Special Patrol was hearing her case, Chevreuse found herself explaining herself and reading her statement over and over. Having finished serving his sentence, her father Donatello was now serving in the Special Patrol. He had pored over her statement, and it had nary a single mistake or blemish.\nThough it had been a long time since he was ousted from his former post, Donatello still understood the Maison Gardiennage's thinking. If Chevreuse was to take up the post of Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol without issue, she would need to provide the good folks at the Maison Gardiennage with a sufficiently \"decent\" statement, such that they might clearly and firmly — yet with a bit of wiggle room — announce her appointment.\nChevreuse was no longer a child. She knew full well that her father had leaked classified intelligence regarding a major case to utilize the resulting interest from the press to assist in investigating that criminal. After her family moved to the Fleuve Cendre, the Gardes who visited — ranking officers among them — had surreptitiously provided aid, so their situation could not be considered too dire. Furthermore, the officers and members of the Special Patrol had made preparations ahead of time for Chevreuse to learn from them in the field, learning all about the relevant work in advance...\nBut saying all of that would be of no help to Chevreuse in taking over as Captain.\nThough Donatello was still uneasy about his daughter following in his footsteps, she had completed all the training he had prepared for her. Chevreuse had given it her all, passing even those trials designed expressly to frustrate and vex her.\nAs Chevreuse plunged forward in the bone-chillingly freezing winter seas, it seemed to take every last ounce of Donatello's willpower to stand still and watch instead of running forth to cradle her in his embrace. As Chevreuse swam back to his side, trembling and shivering, Donatello knew that his daughter was stronger than he was, and even more suited to uphold \"justice.\"\nBut today, let all of that be washed away into eternal silence amid the waters of the Fleuve Cendre.\nFor this father and daughter who long ago had swum together in the icy winter seas, it was now time to take a step forward.\n\"...My father violated Gardes regulations. The evidence of his guilt is conclusive, and the results of the hearing were correct.\"\nWith her final assertion of the facts of the case, Chevreuse folded up the draft of her speech.\nHereafter, justice would make its appearance, all in good time.",
            "The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol Type-II Standard Musket\tCompared to the initial configuration, the improved version of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol's standard musket features a modified butt stock that better fits human shoulders, as well as a longer barrel. Some specialized Type-II muskets feature all-purpose rails attached below the barrel and to the stock. Scopes, grenade launchers, smokescreen launchers, sonic boom launchers, and all kinds of melee weapons are among the various accessories that can be attached to the mounts, allowing them to be adapted for virtually any kind of combat mission.\nHowever, while she was modifying muskets to improve the team's combat capabilities, Chevreuse also raised the evaluation standards for firearms proficiency, adding several requirements not related to firearms themselves, such as unarmed combat.\n\"The raison d'etre for the Special Patrol is capturing criminals, not strutting around showing off your gun!\"\n\"What are you gonna do, refuse a mission if you can't bring your musket?\"\nAnd thus, thanks to the Type-II Standard Musket, the amount of training required vastly increased once more.\nNaturally, Chevreuse herself completed 100% of every single training program.\nSeeing their captain standing strong like an ironwoman in the middle of the practice field, the members of the patrol spoke out spontaneously, yet with one heart and one voice:\n\"Captain, please have mercy on us...!\"",
            "Vision\tThe Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse, rarely discusses how she obtained her Vision of her own accord. To others, she says the reason is because the authority and prestige of the Special Patrol comes from the law and justice. By focusing too much on \"Visions,\" it would only create misunderstandings. To preserve the law's standing, it is better not to discuss such things.\nBut those close to Chevreuse know that this Vision is much more akin to a heavy burden for her.\nAfter Chevreuse joined the Special Patrol, she used her extraordinary talent and perseverance to complete all kinds of internal training programs, memorizing every rule, regulation, and standard for Special Patrol operations along with the related statutes. Without question, she was first in her class, and her pursuit of \"justice\" was widely admired by other members.\nBut the officer in charge of them, Vice Captain Grizzetti, disagreed, and he never selected Chevreuse for field missions. Other members could only guess why: Perhaps it was to protect her? After all, he was once close with her father Donatello, and had taken care of her. They were so close that Chevreuse was said to call him \"Uncle Grizzetti.\" Or maybe he was planning to groom her to take on some particularly important job?\nChevreuse didn't think about such complicated matters. After the sixth time she was excluded from a mission, she could bear it no longer and finally asked the usually amiable Uncle Grizzetti why he never chose her for fieldwork.\n\"You're not ready.\"\nCame the reply.\n\"Fix your conception of justice first, Chevreuse. If your understanding of it is limited to an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, then it would be best for you to leave this place. This is not some lynching site. This is where the voice of justice must ring true.\"\nAt the time, Chevreuse had not yet grasped this, nor did she even know just when she would be ready. Perhaps she would spend her entire life trying to understand. Or perhaps she would have to be ready the very next second.\nSoon, Grizzetti found himself shorthanded during an urgent mission hunting down a gang of notorious criminals. With no choice but to call on Chevreuse, he repeatedly warned her to stay close, follow orders, and not act without permission. And then it was time to move out, and the various members filed out into the howling tempest to close off every possible route the gang of criminals could take.\nChevreuse and Grizzetti concealed themselves behind some shrubbery, but the criminals did not appear. Just as the two of them began to think their intelligence was mistaken and were preparing to withdraw quietly, a shot rang out from a hidden position, and Grizzetti was struck. Chevreuse counterattacked nearly instantly, using the muzzle flash in the darkness to sight the criminal's position before hitting them with a single precise bullet. But Uncle Grizzetti had already sunk into eternal silence.\nNow, only Chevreuse and the killer remained. The howling wind and torrential downpour would conceal the sound of another gunshot, and the Special Patrol... They might not inquire too closely in the case of how this fiend who had murdered one of their colleagues had been shot dead.\nBut more importantly, the killer was right in front of her. If she wished to carry out justice, now was the time. She lifted her musket, aimed right between his eyes... and then lowered the gun.\nThe Special Security and Surveillance Patrol speaks only in the name of justice, and true \"justice\" can only be decided by the courts. Perhaps this was what it meant to be \"ready\" to become a member of the Special Patrol.\n\"This is the Court of Fontaine Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. You are under arrest.\"\nNo sooner had she finished speaking than the killer began to hobble away, seeking to flee without the slightest hesitation. With the crack of a musket, the man was struck squarely in his right leg. He cried out in agony, cursing as he rolled on the ground, finally coming to a stop before the feet of the other Patrol members who had rushed over.\nThe \"justice\" of the law is meted out by the courts, but as for Chevreuse's own personal justice, that is carried out by her alone.\nAs Chevreuse finally completely lowered her musket, she had yet to notice a Vision was now hanging from the stock.\nIn the lashing wind and rain, its glow was not readily apparent, much like justice yet to be revealed — pale and dark."

But after some time, I suddenly felt that a dual wielding technique was really strong and impressive. It wasn't long before the instructor approached me and told me to stop practicing using that technique. When I asked him why, all he said was that it wasn't the standard sword technique, and that it was \"improper.\" After that, I never attended his class again. Now that I think about it, it's fortunate that I insisted on following the way I preferred. Perhaps I'm just the sort who needs to keep both my hands busy.",
            "Interesting Things\tTamoto is my first masterpiece. At the time, I was just thinking to stitch together a puppet girl who looked like me to be my model and assistant. Huh? What about a companion? No, I have no need for that.",
            "About Navia\tShe used to beg me to help her design all kinds of strange things. For example, little crowns for every handle on a ship's helm... I couldn't help but roll my eyes at her request, and tell her that the most I would do is design her hat like a boat.\nThose who say I'm ahead of my time have clearly never spoken to her.",
            "About Lyney\tI can't make a hat that could hide secrets, but it seems Lyney can enchant his hat to do just that... I'm a little curious about how it feels to wear a hat full of so many tricks and secrets like his. As for me, I don't need the burden of all that, it's easiest to just say what's on my mind.",
            "About Lynette\tThe magician's assistant sure doesn't say much, but I know she trusts me. You know, I sure get a lot of love from cats...",
            "About Charlotte\tOne time, Charlotte came into the shop, hoping to do an interview with me. I told her there was no point, because there was nothing new to talk about. But just as she was leaving, a drunkard came stumbling into the shop and started causing trouble. She recorded the whole thing... What a fiasco. I've heard of journalists chasing leads, but now it seems news chases the journalists.",
            "About Chevreuse\tWorking with Chevreuse and talking with her are a cinch. So easy, in fact, that whenever I say goodbye to her and return to tending to my customers again, it takes me a moment to shift gears mentally.",
            "About Emilie\tEmilie's perfumes are very popular. We have a business agreement where I ask her to deliver small quantities of perfume she's working on to Chioriya Boutique. I let Eloffe secretly spray the perfume in the fitting room, and then I'll let her know any feedback I get from the customers. Even after all this time, I've never once had a customer ever say that my fitting room smelled strange. In fact, they usually come one after another to ask where they can buy the fragrance. Out of curiosity, I always buy a bottle when she brings them to sell in her shop. I have to say that such fragrances which can always bring a sense of refreshment are truly works of art.",
            "About Wriothesley\tYes. Some of my friends and partners have mentioned him to me before. I admire his skills at management and diplomacy, but I certainly have no intention of changing my way of doing things.",
            "About Kirara\tWhile I was still in Inazuma, there was a cat with green eyes that always liked to follow me whenever I went out into the wild in search of inspiration. The kitty seemed to be very interested in the colors and patterns of the fabric I was carrying. She would even come up and rub her head against my legs when she was in a good mood.\nLater, I recognized those green eyes again, but on a girl with two tails. The way she gazed at new and intriguing things still had not changed after so many years.",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tIf I wasn't always slipping away to go play when I was a child, I probably would never have had the chance to meet the young lady of the Kamisato Clan. There was one time when I climbed my way into the Kamisato Clan's courtyard, and her Temari just happened to roll over towards the wall. I could tell that she was both surprised and happy to see me. We played together and chatted for quite some time, but I was discovered in the end. And so, our brief friendship came to an end as I was kicked off the premises.",
            "More about Chiori: I\tI don't think my temper is as bad as people make it out to be. I just don't like wasting my time on trivial matters, that's all. But for some reason, it's always those trivial things that come back to haunt me. So, over time, I've ended up with a bad reputation. I would say that's completely unjust!",
            "More about Chiori: II\tEver since I was a kid, I've always had a problem with authority. There was a period when I hated the rules, and would always insist on going against the grain. Thanks to this headstrong character of mine, I've had to go through a lot of suffering. But eventually, I came to understand that rules aren't completely a bad thing. What I really can't stand is the feeling that I can't make decisions based on what I truly think.",
            "More about Chiori: III\tWhen I was little, I used to always look forward to the summer festival in my hometown. Every year, people would take out the most vibrant and beautiful clothes, and carefully put them on before joining the crowd...\nEvery time the festival came around, there'd be all of these brightly colored spheres hanging from people's belts, goldfish that you couldn't scoop up from the bowl no matter how hard you tried, apple candy so sweet that even the children couldn't finish them all, and fireworks so beautiful that they could have only come from the Naganohara house... I always had a lot of fun at such festivals, but even then, I would always feel like something was \"missing\" when I went home at the end of the night. It was only after I got much older that I realized I must have wanted to become more than just a spectator at such a wonderful event.\n...It's just like how people will always associate the house of \"Naganohara\" with fireworks. I hope that one day, people will also associate festivals with Chioriya clothes.\nHehe, just thinking about the prospect of that gets me really fired up. Alright, time to go back to the shop and churn out a few more designs.",
            "More about Chiori: IV\tAlthough I can get quite immersed in my work, I also enjoy living in the moment. When I have some free time, I would often pack some food and find a lovely place in nature to take a cozy midday nap, before returning home, relaxing some more, and then finally falling asleep to my favorite music. Oh, and other times, I like to go out for food with my friends, talk about everything that's happening in the world, and party until everyone's completely hammered. Honestly, it all just depends on what I feel like doing in the moment. Just as fashion only exists in the moment, I also love living in the moment. So, what do you think? Want to go out with me tonight and enjoy a whole night of fun?",
            "More about Chiori: V\tI love Inazuma's petite desserts, as well as all culinary dishes subtle and light. Similarly, I also like the feel of my homeland's fabrics, as well as the practice of taking a bath after a long working day. But on the flip side, I also adore the soft waves of Fontaine's seas, as well as the beautiful scenery underneath the waters.\nSometimes, I wonder if everything is in fact predestined, and if I'm still living in the shadow of my past. But then, another question always follows — would the answer to that really change anything? In any case, I'm still me, living in my present. Even if I'm only the way I am due to what has happened in my past, my future is still in my own hands, and no one in this world can really change that.",
            "Chiori's Hobbies\tI'm pursuing my dream through my work, and exploring the meaning of freedom through my art. What's the point of spending years and years of your life over something that's not near and dear to your heart?",
            "Chiori's Troubles\tSometimes, I worry that I haven't made as much progress as I'd hoped, and thus, it'd be hard to know when I would actually realize my dream of making Chioriya renowned throughout the world. Still, that's no reason to question or abandon the dream. Rather than worrying or doubting myself, my time would be better spent creating a few more designs.",
            "Favorite Food\tI can never forget the Inazuman desserts I used to indulge in as a child. But rather than the joy of tasting them, I've always been more interested in the process of making them. Had I been less drawn to the fascinating world of fabrics and color, the world would have gained another dessert chef.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI can't handle food with particularly strong flavors, like Haggis, for example. The experience of eating it is kind of like... suddenly getting hit with a faceful of Geo Specter out of nowhere. Does that make sense to you?",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tMm, I do love this dish. Why don't you bring me some more next time. Don't worry, I'll also bring a gift for you in return.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tNot bad. I think this would be most enjoyable after a hard day's work in the shop.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tUgh, I'm not fond of this flavor. Bring me something lighter on the palette next time.",
            "Birthday\tYeah, yeah... Happy birthday, or whatever. Just tell me if there's a gift you like — I can't be bothered to try and guess what you want. Hm? Too direct? Alright then, why don't you grab Navia, Kirara, and the others, and maybe a few of your friends as well. We can have a party tonight at my place. I'll take some notes on the gifts that the others have prepared for you, and make you an accessory right then and there. Ten thousand mora that you'd like it.

            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tOf course, as a master of my craft, my hands will never shake while cutting fabric, but I'll admit, the excitement and anticipation has my heart really beating right now.

            "Character Details\tYou push open the doors to the boutique. Situated on one of Fontaine's busiest thoroughfares, it is named for its designer.\nThe crisp ringing of a bell chimes from above as if wishing luck to all customers who step through the door. If the rumors swirling about have even a grain of truth to them, then perhaps such blessings will come in handy.\n\"Welcome to the Chioriya Boutique, how may I help you?\" The greeting that reaches your ears, while perhaps lacking somewhat in enthusiasm, is filled with assurance.\nThe owner of the voice shoots you a glance from behind the counter. A striking foreigner with captivating eyes — just like they said.\n\"A personalized, custom job? Or something off the shelf?\" Her second question. The tone fills you with a certain feeling — as though the second someone steps through the door, even the highest-ranking aristocrat becomes merely a guest in her kingdom, while she sits high upon her throne, allowing supplicants to choose from among the blessings she offers.\n\"I'd like tailor-made formal attire.\" You say. Her expression softens a little. It appears that in this kingdom, customizing the cut of the cloth to the customer and designing a personalized outfit in the Kingdom's name is something worth a smile.\nPerhaps this is the best possible outcome, you muse to yourself. After all, those who recommended the shop to you not only all praised the exquisite handiwork of this designer, but some nearly couldn't stop themselves from opening wide their wardrobes to show off the dazzling contents within, as though they wished nothing more than to shove you inside to bask in the clothes' glory for a day. They even say that the owner of the shop is rarely found within, and if she is on the premises, that means she is in a good mood.\nBut you quietly swallow all the same, for you know when fortune does not hold you in her fickle favor, then all manner of unimaginable and outrageous things may occur when the owner is in, such as...\nBefore you can even get a handle on your thoughts and feelings, the bell above the door screams a metallic protest. The boutique's door has been kicked wide open by a man swaying and rocking, foul breath reeking of alcohol and language yet more foul spilling out of his mouth.\n\"I—I won! I won the bet, the Boss is in toda—\" Though you could not clearly see just what happened, before he even finished speaking, he suddenly flew out the window, drawing an elegant arc through the air.\nChiori brushes her hands and closes the window, before saying to you, as if nothing had happened, \"Apologies, the weather has been somewhat inclement of late. All kinds of trash have come blowing into my shop. It's been taken care of, so pay it no heed.\"\nIt appears this kingdom does not welcome all unconditionally.",
            "Character Story 1\t\"Ms. Chiori, what past experiences did you have that forged the success you now enjoy?\" — A reporter once asked her this question.\nChiori had hesitated as she searched for an appropriate response in her memories, but simply could not find a good answer. After all, in her own estimation, there was nothing special at all about her past.\nChiori was born into a family of merchants. Though not well-off by any means, she had lacked for nothing in her childhood. Busy with their business, her parents had not been overly strict with her. This, her parents joked, is what had created her carefree and unbridled nature.\nAt the age when many young girls began to study the art of tea or of flowers, Chiori was climbing trees and catching fish with other children... It wasn't that her parents never tried to get her to learn. But making Chiori sit quietly in front of a tea table for an entire day? Why, that would be the death of her (and of her teacher).\n—Alright, then let's just have her study the art of the sword, said her father.\nBefore long, Chiori was carrying two swords with her to class. \"Two is obviously better,\" she declared, boldly and confidently, dual blades in hand.\nHer teacher had never seen a student with — his words to her father were tactfully chosen — such personality. And thus a seething Chiori was sent back home.\nSimilar scenes played out many times, yet Chiori's parents were never too harsh with her, only believing \"That's just how she is.\"\nUntil one day, Chiori's mother came home to discover her sitting quietly before the table, staring entranced at a bolt of high-quality fabric. The Chiori that was normally bouncing off the walls was nowhere to be found.\n\"Do you like it?\" Asked her mother. \"It feels so smooth,\" came little Chiori's blunt answer, \"And it's so pretty, how was it made?\"\nAnd thus, in the days that followed, Chiori sent tailoring teacher after teacher storming off in frustration, just as before. But at the same time, she also learned many tailoring techniques.\nAlso, in all fairness, it should be mentioned that Chiori was already far more well-behaved with the tailors than she had been with all those other teachers.",
            "Character Story 2\tWhen the news of Inazuma's Sakoku policy reached Fontaine, the topics of tea-table discussions centered around the \"Raiden Shogun\" over there, that \"Vision Hunt Decree,\" and those ceaseless thunderstorms on the islands, as though discussing some sort of fantastical anecdotes.\nAfter all, even the loudest thunderclap cannot be heard across the vastness of the sea to the dome of the sky above their heads.\nBut the people of Fontaine could never have imagined that a storm that would imminently engulf Fontaine had at that time already left the shores of Inazuma, and was quietly heading for them. And the name of that storm was \"Chiori.\"\nThe storm took shape on the journey out of Inazuma. From the very beginning, it had decided to let loose its thunder upon the streets of Fontaine — the capital of fashion and the City of the Arts.\nAt first, it was only a few rumblings from the diverse firmament of the fashion world that nobody paid much heed to.\n\"It's just a fad, that's all,\" \"It'll be forgotten in a few days\"... That's what they all said at first, as though they were discussing nothing more than a cat of unusual coloration that had appeared on the streets.\nYet after this storm named \"Chiori\" struck that year's Fontaine Fashion Week, nearly all could hear the echoes of its thunderous fury reverberating throughout Fontaine.\nIn a flash, the headlines of Fontaine's papers were completely occupied with a foreign name.\nSome critics have opined that quality clothes are not just for looking at, but can also be \"heard.\" In this aspect, Chiori had succeeded. Every stitch and thread of her clothes told a story: the echoes of waves, the breathing of a forest, a sweet spring gushing forth in the desert...\nNaturally, the \"old guard\" of the fashion world could not tolerate this foreign interloper encroaching upon their territory, and thus raised their banners and declared war upon this \"invader,\" using various methods.\nYet everyone can see how it ended. Not only did they taste the bitterness of defeat, but some of them — for the first time in their lives — tasted the feeling of falling butt-first into the gutter.",
            "Character Story 3\tIt is unclear when the Chioriya Boutique gained the nickname of \"intelligence boutique.\" Even Chiori herself is at a bit of a loss as to how this occurred. It's almost as if all she needs to do is share some of the information she has overheard in her shop with her friends, and it will have a tremendous impact on certain matters.\nLater, she came to understand that rather than the Chioriya Boutique being the source of reams of intelligence, it was better to say that rivers of intelligence flowed of their own accord through her doors.\nThose impeccably dressed merchants and government dignitaries were a kaleidoscopic flock of butterflies, each scattering the pollen known as \"intelligence\" from their fluttering wings onto that gorgeous flower called the Chioriya Boutique. Their actual intention was not to pollinate this flower, but rather to flaunt just how much pollen they had to the other butterflies. They consider the amount of information one had on them to be far more worthy of taking pride in than the quantity of gems sewn into one's garments.\n—Have you heard? So-and-so has yet another new flame!\n—Oh, and that one, they seem to have sealed a huge deal with the one from the Maison Gardiennage!\n—You mean the one in charge of transportation? Now I've heard that what he's really transporting is...\n—Shh! You can't say that out loud!\n...\nIf she really had to choose, Chiori would rather not listen to all this. She feels allergic to this sort of pollen, with the primary symptom being difficulty in quietly and wholeheartedly focusing on clothing. Thus, when designing new styles and products, she generally does not show up in her shop.\nBut after realizing the value of such intelligence, she began to take a certain amount of notice on behalf of others. Should the interests of friends or the safety of Fontaine be involved, she would kindly send a letter to give a friendly reminder, or do so to their face. For her, this is no different from tailoring clothes — sewing each element into its proper place.\nIn accordance with a businessperson's principles, Chiori naturally collects some small tokens of \"repayment.\" After all, as she is wont to say: It's only business if there's an exchange.",
            "Character Story 4\tIf you truly wish to understand Chiori's designs, then you must witness Chiori fashioning clothes with your own eyes.\nThe first time people see said designs, it's as if they cannot comprehend what is before them. Does this designer not know what \"rules\" are? How can women's clothes be tailored like men's? How can men's formalwear use women's fabrics?\nYet there is some quality within that attracts them, and halts them in their tracks. It's as if all of this rejection and resistance to the \"rules\" is so eminently reasonable that it is plainly saying: You are the ones who are wrong.\nIt is the same for Chiori as she tailors the clothes. From the way she treats the fabric, it is as if she has never seen the material before. Her cuts come from unexpected angles, ignoring the direction of the thread, and sometimes suddenly seizing upon adding a completely new structure halfway through, before upending her own work once again...\nSometimes, she will even draw her sword and swiftly cut the first-rate fabric before her with a clean slash, as though she were not making clothes, but rather dueling — as though she were fighting with the fabric in her hands, vying for authority, with her emerging as the ultimate victor.\nNo one makes clothes as she does, much less converses so with the fabric. Her workstation becomes an operating table, and she knows just what the perfect form of the fabric is, with each stroke of her blade excising lesions and sores from her patient...\nAn employee once complained to Chiori that it was too difficult to cut the style she requested.\n—\"Why? Are your scissors not sharp enough?\"\n—\"No, that's not it... It's just...\"\n—\"Then you can cut it.\"\nShe will make you feel that if you cannot cut and trim clothes exactly as you please, then that is because you're simply too foolish to do so. Yet when you see the clothes she tailors, you will feel that if you cannot live exactly as you please, then that is yet more foolish still.\n\"Ms. Chiori, I would like to ask, just how do you design your clothes?\" —Came the reporter's question.\n—\"However I want.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tDreams. Such an ephemeral word, far flimsier than even the thinnest silks Chiori has laid hands on. Yet when worn, they can be heavier and more suffocating than the thickest fabric.\nShe chased her dream all the way to Fontaine, and yet when she finally managed to catch up to it, she discovered that it had once more run even farther away of its own accord.\nSo, what next? Take up the burden of her dream and forge ahead, or just be content with what she had?\n—No. Chiori firmly told herself. I choose neither.\nShe enjoyed the sweet aftertaste dreams left, the satisfaction that filled her. Yet she hated using dreams of the future to urge herself onward. That was itself a kind of shackle.\nShe chooses to live in the present.\nShe will work tirelessly day and night on a piece of clothing, just so that it might grace the stage of Fashion Week. She will also disappear for weeks on a whim, enjoying every sight along the way, the starry sky overhead every night, until finally setting off on the road back home once tired. It all depends on her mood.\nNone can dictate any aspect of her life to her, no one can tell her what she \"should\" do; not even her own dreams. It is almost as if she would toss life itself out the window without a moment's hesitation, should it prove an obstacle to her.\n\"Never give up\" is Chiori's true brand. She has said so herself.\nStrangely, it's as though it is in fact her \"dream\" that has begun actively trying to draw close to her out of fright. As opposed to her chasing it, her dream is attempting to curry favor with her, like a once-wild tamed beast attempting to cozy up to its new master's side.\n—Ms. Chiori, you've said that you want your brand to become fashionable across Teyvat. May I ask when you expect to achieve this goal?\n—Hard to say. Perhaps when I feel like it.",
            "Chiori's Drafts\tWhen a Snow-Winged Goose chasing the reflection of the moon leapt into the lake, Chiori awoke. She blinked and yawned, gazing at the black evening dress glittering like the star-studded heavens. The shadows of her dream were melting in her mind, leaving inky traces of sadness.\n\"Scissors, please.\" She pushed herself into a sitting position as her loyal assistant appeared by her side, handing Chiori the tool in her hand.\n\"And a pencil.\" She added, and \"Tamoto\" pulled out a pencil that seemed to have seen quite some use from who knows where.\nWhen seeking inspiration, Chiori prefers solitude to company, and often sets off on her own with little more than the clothes on her back, disliking burdening herself with this and that.\nA notebook is something that nags at her, as though begging her to write something down. A map is too confining, as though seeking to draw lines and boundaries through her empire of fashion without her say-so.\nHer drafts are harder to understand than those of any other designer in the business, for they are often drawn on menus, leaves, or even her own clothing...\nYet her finished products are also more breathtaking than those of any other designer, as they are the distillation of the scenery she has seen, the characters she has met, and even those melted remnants of dreams...\n\"Done.\" She looked at the newspaper before her — or more precisely, the tattered remnants thereof — and nodded in satisfaction. She didn't even remember how she had picked it up today, but that was irrelevant.\nHer drafts are born with such spontaneity, and completed with the same free and easy spirit: They are brought back to the Chioriya Boutique, copied out onto the toile, and then turned into tea-stained taiyaki wrapping paper before finally being laid to rest in the garbage.\nAnd as for the essence of the drafts... They are for customers to admire and acclaim, and for being enshrined on the front page of fashion magazines.",
            "Vision\tNo way forward. Nothing left to do.\nChiori lay prone before the table, eyebrows knitting at her first work. \"Tamoto\" said nothing, as though sleeping — or perhaps it was that she had simply never awoken. Chiori's habit was to use a small amount of cloth to try out her designs on Tamoto before making an outfit. Should the result prove satisfactory, she would then copy the design onto a full-size model. Yet none of her designs had been able to gain the approval of her teacher.\nNot long before, yet another teacher had expelled her. She had gradually come to understand that sometimes, it wasn't that her teachers disliked her designs, but that they simply didn't dare to be the first to adopt such designs. The judgmental gaze of others were threads far harder to snip than the stitches of any clothes.\n\"And what do you think?\" She asked the puppet in front of her. \"Tamoto\" had never complained about her designs, and would happily try on any clothes without protest. But if she could open her mouth, would she say those three words, \"I like it\"?\nNot long before, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos had extended an invitation to Chiori, asking her to work in the shop. Chiori appreciated Ogura Mio's intentions, for among the children studying tailoring, she was one who seemed to admire Chiori's designs.\nBut no. Chiori shook her head, rejecting the idea.\nWhen all was said and done, that was someone's else shop, someone else's name. She didn't like the feeling of dwelling within the home of another.\n\"Fontaine...\" She whispered softly. The word had been bubbling to the surface of her mind of late, as a hummed tune overheard may linger forever in the ear, unforgettable.\nThe books said that was the capital of fashion, a city of the arts. The merchants said it was a place that revered entertainment, and that anything interesting would be liked by everyone there.\nThen, Chiori had thought it too far away. It would take months of travel just to get there. Now, she felt that Inazuma was too far away. Her designs would reach few here.\n\"Fontaine... Fontaine...\" She murmured the name several more times, as though doing so could pull that faraway country closer to her.\nAs she thought of \"Ogura Textiles & Kimonos,\" she found herself speaking another name — \"Chioriya Boutique.\"\n—It was as though her heartstrings had suddenly been plucked and were now humming. The sounds of \"Fontaine\" and \"Chioriya Boutique\" were two notes that seemed to form a perfect harmonious chord.\n\"Fontaine's 'Chioriya Boutique'...\" She closed her eyes and imagined a sign emblazoned with her name appearing on Fontaine's vibrant avenues, and how the people there would sound speaking the strange name. It suddenly all seemed so real to her, as though, at that moment, the real her was already in Fontaine, and the \"her\" left here was merely a shadow she had carelessly left behind in Inazuma.\nShe swiftly sat up and left the house without so much as a word to her parents. They were shocked, and looked at each other in dismay, guessing that perhaps she was going out for a walk to unwind. Yet when she next returned, she had already said her goodbyes to some, and left a few others with no doubt as to what she really thought of them. Either way, the name \"Chiori\" would certainly return to Inazuma's shores long before she did. That was the oath she swore.\n\"I'm leaving tomorrow,\" She said to her parents. That melody humming internally was urging her forward, and she had to go chase the her that was in Fontaine.\nHer mother looked at her father reproachfully, as if to say \"Of all the traits she inherited, it had to have been your personality.\"\nNaturally, her parents didn't try to stop her, as they knew very well that once this child said something, it was already set in stone.\nAs Chiori returned to her room to pack her things, the items on her table suddenly shifted, startling her.\n\"Tamoto\" slowly turned in circles, as though showing off the clothes Chiori had made for her, before happily floating over to Chiori— and in the puppet's outstretched hands was a brilliant Vision."

            "About Xiangling\tXiangling's cooking is universally praised, but I personally don't touch any of her spicy dishes. Why? Oh, you know — just, uh... personal preference, that's all. I mean, come on, Mushroom Slime Stew... Does that sound appetizing to you?",
            "About Shenhe\tThe elders in my clan have mentioned her before. The fate of her family... *sigh* It's something we can all sympathize with. I originally thought we would be able to bring a long-lost relative back into our clan. The elders were overjoyed, too, when they heard she was still alive — they even prepared gifts for her, and picked an auspicious day for a grand reunion. What we hadn't counted on was that most of the time, she's extremely difficult to track down. Wait a minute, based on our relative positions in the family tree, does that mean that I... There's no way I'd have to call her \"Auntie Shenhe\"... right?",
            "About Yelan\tI met her once, back when I'd just become an exorcist. I'd taken a commission to perform an exorcism in someone's home, and was just leaving at the end when I ran into her. She wrote my name down in a booklet — I guess she just wanted to confirm I wasn't doing anything suspicious... Anyway, it was just that one time, I never saw her again after that.\nNow that I think about it, it's probably because the sight of me meditating motionless must be pretty boring to watch. Not exactly suspicious.",

            "More About Chongyun: II\tI was born with a pure yang spirit, meaning I have too much positive energy... Apparently it's so rare it only happens once every thousand generations or so. It means I repel all evil for miles around... *sigh* Actually, that's a bad thing. I must be the only exorcist in history who can't get within ten miles of an evil spirit.",
            "More About Chongyun: III\tOne of the main consequences of having a pure yang spirit is excess passion, something which has gotten me into many embarrassing situations. In an effort to alleviate these symptoms, I have to abstain from eating chilis and all hot food. I also have to take a parasol with me everywhere, and I avoid listening to rousing music. I wonder, will I ever find a way to work around my condition?",
            "More About Chongyun: IV\tWaiting for evil to show up at the doorstep will get you nowhere — you have to go out and hunt it down. By purging Liyue of evil spirits, I bring peace of mind to people and also broaden my horizons. If an evil spirit ever bothers you, just let me know. I'll come and help you out right away.",
            "More About Chongyun: V\tTo permanently banish the forces of evil from the world is my ultimate goal as an exorcist. If that grand day ever comes, I suppose I should be able to consider trying many new things, such as hot springs, Jueyun Chilis, and... partaking in other activities of a more passionate nature. Ugh, what am I doing... Ugh, I shouldn't be dwelling on these things, even thinking about them is too stimulating for me...",

            "Chongyun's Troubles\tAfter making numerous inquiries and putting in an enormous amount of effort, I finally tracked down the location of an old haunted temple. So I camped out there for four whole days, ready to exorcise the hell out of that place... and nothing happened. Not even the faintest glimpse of an evil spirit. *sigh* Sadly, this is a regular occurrence for me.",
            "Favorite Food\tNothing makes me happier than sitting down to an authentic Inazuman meal, ingredients imported of course. After training hard all day, the ice-cold freshness of Inazuman cuisine takes the exhaustion away.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tAnything piping hot and laden with chilis is an absolute no-go for me. The mere thought of a Jueyun Chili gives me hot flashes.",

            "Birthday\tOn the anniversary of your birth, please accept this gift of a flower, made of ice crystals. I carved it myself. If you ever encounter an evil spirit, cast this toward it — the spell I have cast upon it will immediately come into effect and hopefully get you out alive. Also... Happy birthday.",

            "Character Details\tThroughout its long history, Liyue has never had a lack of rumors and myths regarding all manner of evil spirits and demons. And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has to do something about them.\nChongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists, and has possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his pure-yang spirit. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to scatter evil spirits. \nHowever, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never come face-to-face with a single ghost or demon.\nChongyun believes in his heart that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has... is just not orthodox.\nTherefore, he has dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his unique physical condition.\nYet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his path to self-realization?",
            "Character Story 1\tWhen Chongyun first ventured out as an exorcist, there had been much talk of an evil spirit lurking inside Liyue Harbor.\nThe victim of these hauntings was a woman from a family with a high enough stature to even have a word or two with the Liyue Qixing.\nFrom a time she knew not when, her sleep began to be harassed by sounds that kept her awake, but every time she tried to follow the sound, it would suddenly shift behind her, and begin ringing again in her ears.\nThis shock caused her unspeakable distress, and she even lost weight for loss of appetite.\nHer wealth was enough to hire the best exorcists from all over, but no matter what they tried, they had to retreat empty-handed. And not only did the noises persist, they even grew in boldness.\nIt was then, just when she had given up all hope, that Chongyun walked through her door.\n\"I apologize for coming just now, it has been far too sunny lately... I heard that this place houses a very stubborn ghost. Please, leave it to me.\"\nThen Chongyun brought a chair over, and sat upon it in the middle of the house for a time.\nThat night, the strange sounds were no more.\nThe wealthy woman finally had a good night's sleep, and she came running to Chongyun the next morning with an overabundance of gold and jewelry as a reward.\nBut Chongyun, as was his wont, only accepted his usual fee of a few hundred Mora without an ounce of emotion on his face.\nEver since that incident, Chongyun has found that his reputation precedes him for miles around. He has become beloved in Liyue for his \"style and character,\" and indeed scholars have given him this appellation: \"a heart of clear water, and a face of ice.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tHowever, calling his mannerisms and style \"frosty\" couldn't be farther from the truth.\nDue to the abundance of yang energy in his constitution, he is constantly troubled by increased body temperature and sudden urges or impulses.\nHe has tried everything to alleviate the issues both physically and psychologically.\nHis methods include not drinking hot water, not eating hot or spicy food, wearing light clothes, not getting into arguments, keeping himself from being angered, staying indoors on sweltering days, and always bringing a parasol when on the job.\nIn short, he attempted to stay away from everything that might aggravate his condition.\nDespite all this, his yang energy did not subside a whit.\nA little depressed, Chongyun began to wrestle with his own body. When he heard about an evil spirit in Dragonspine, he made for the peak wearing only a shirt.\nThough it was hard enough to keep himself warm, he still felt this insufficient. Digging a hole in a frozen lake, he jumped in and soaked in the icy water while waiting for the evil spirit to show itself.\nAfter staying in the lake for half a day, he finally caught a glimpse of his target.\nHowever, after pursuing it down to the mountainside, he discovered it was only a snow rabbit that had been frightened off by his flying swords and floating charms.\nThe fever that he ran afterward lasted far longer than it would in a normal person.",
            "Character Story 3\tChongyun's pure-yang spirit is not only a huge obstacle in his path as an exorcist, but a constant daily hassle.\nHe must be extra careful to stay away from \"heaty\" things, to which he is very sensitive, or risk his yang energy and emotions going out of control.\nChongyun's clan once held a celebration party at Wanmin Restaurant. And though he waited until all the dishes had gone cold, he did not expect the tender rice balls to be stuffed with Jueyun Chili.\nAfter but a single bite... Chongyun had no recollection of what happened next.\nHowever, according to the victim, chef Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant, many unforgettable things happened.\nChongyun first jumped onto the reception desk and shouted, \"Everything's on me tonight!\" — never mind that he did not actually have any money on him.\nHe then began to chat with customers at other tables as if they were old pals, bragging to them of how incredible his clan's exorcist arts were, never forgetting to taste other people's dishes on the tables before he left.\nLastly, he claimed to have sensed an evil spirit in Wanmin Restaurant. This he did not find, but he did slap a charm on Xiangling's forehead and chase her around with his sword.\nAfterwards, Chongyun scrimped and saved for an entire month to pay Wanmin Restaurant back for the mess and any damages he might have caused; he also gave Xiangling an evil-warding talisman that he carved by hand.\nBut Xiangling, for her part, didn't mind Chongyun's \"transgressions\" at all. Instead, she felt that the crazy Chongyun was the real Chongyun, without any personal walls up.",
            "Character Story 4\tChongyun has had the privilege of meeting a true friend in his long journey as an exorcist: Xingqiu.\nIn contrast to the hard-working Chongyun, Xingqiu was naturally gifted, and had a more flexible way of looking at problems.\nAfter learning about Chongyun's troubles, Xingqiu came up with a possible solution.\n\"If you can't reduce the effects of your yang energy, what if you sought out an evil spirit that is immune to it?\"\nThis was a eureka moment for Chongyun. Since then, Chongyun has no longer sought to alleviate his condition. Instead, he now tries to get Xingqiu to come with him to find such a spirit.\n\"What? Sightings of the legendary Aoyin near the Sea of Clouds? Leave it to me!\"\n\"The old house at Feiyun Slope has been taken over by an evil spirit? My bad. I'll attend to it right away.\"\n\"A master exorcist is staying over at Wangshu Inn? I could learn a lot from him... Hmm, better go with a gift.\"\nXingqiu usually just makes these \"leads\" up as he goes, and thanks to his \"advice,\" Chongyun often comes back empty-handed, blaming his bad luck.\n\"I tried my best to look for it, and even spent quite a sum purchasing more intelligence on that evil spirit — but I wound up missing it by a hair anyway,\" Chongyun says, abashed.\nIf Xingqiu has time to spare when such an occasion arises, he will encourage Chongyun, treat him to some new cold dishes he has found and then set off to get Chongyun's swindled money back.\nA warm and reliable companion, indeed! — So Chongyun thinks at such moments. Who could he possibly trust, if not his fine friend Xingqiu?",
            "Character Story 5\tIn truth, Chongyun wishes that he could fit in more, but he is often forced to reject the invitations of others on account of his need to control his abundance of yang energy.\nOf these practices, he finds one particularly incomprehensible: hot springs.\nBathing and \"relaxing\" in steaming-hot water? Even the sound of that scares him a hundred times more than freezing in a lake on Dragonspine.\nHowever, he has also heard everyone sing yearning praises of these hot springs, praising their comfort, and asserting that they become more so the hotter they are, and that one is filled with energy for a whole week afterward.\nChongyun still doesn't know if this is true or if people are just teasing him.\nAnd he would have dared to try it out, if not for the ever-present problem of his pure-yang spirit.\nXingqiu once asked him this:\n\"If you were able to master your yang energy and rid the world of all evil spirits someday...what would you do after that?\"\nThis seemingly off-the-cuff remark troubled Chongyun deeply.\nPerhaps he had indeed missed out on a lot in life on account of his condition.\nBut he doesn't regret spending time. If one way of living doesn't work, he just needs to find himself another — and in any case, he already has his answer.\nIf that day comes, well, he'll go to the hot springs then.",
            "Field Guide to Demons and Beasts\tThe tomes that Chongyun's family has passed down from generation to generation detail every evil spirit they have ever subdued.\nFrom little critters to the monstrous demons found in tall tales of horror, their varieties are almost dazzling.\nIt was one such terrifying story that inspired Chongyun's vow to rid the world of evil spirits.\nBut as far as he is concerned, inheriting these books has... also proved inconvenient.\nOther than textual descriptions, the books also contain illustrations of said evil spirits that carefully detail their unique characteristics — even if the artist may not have been the greatest talent.\nBut Chongyun has never seen an evil spirit in his life. Unwilling to break with this artistic tradition, he was at a loss.\nUltimately, he would attempt to use his imagination to draw some suitably strange images.\n—Thus did the Field Guide to Demons and Beasts grow ever more exotic. Best not to think too deeply about that seven-winged, five-legged chicken-beast or that half-fish, half-hilichurl demon.",
            "Vision\t\"Those other exorcists at least have the courtesy to wave their swords or tack on some talismans. You just sat here for a while, and now you say you're done, and that I should pay you? Who are you trying to fool?\"\nChongyun faced a great deal of suspicion when he first took up the role of an exorcist.\nHe immediately faced one big hurdle: it was a lot easier to prove that \"evil spirits are present\" than not.\nOf course he would seem a charlatan even compared to \"exorcists\" who just went through the motions.\nWith all the ability in the world but no place to use it, looked on with suspicion, and needing to suppress any passionate impulses...\nThose who eventually apologized to him were also few.\nBut even so, Chongyun would not go with the flow, and use some fancy act to cover for his real method of conducting exorcism.\nEven with his unique composition posing countless obstacles for him, Chongyun has never once considered giving up.\nOne day, he will become the greatest exorcist in Liyue, control his abundance of yang energy, and rid the world of evil spirits.\nPerhaps it was this resolve that earned him the gods' favor — that said, the Vision granted to Chongyun was one of \"Cryo\" rather than \"Pyro.\"\nAs to which of his goals it was that the Vision responded to, that is also a mystery."

            "Clorinde's Hobbies\tUnlike my work as a duelist, being a Game Master in Tabletop Troupe gives me the freedom to stay outside of the story itself. and observe people's reactions without getting personally involved in all the drama.

            "Character Details\tDisputes are a Mora a dozen in Fontaine, day in and day out.\nA confectioner might accuse another of stealing their recipe — and not only that, but replacing Bulle Fruit peel with Mint, thus bringing disgrace not only upon themselves, but upon the very dessert itself! Or a playwright might accuse a fanatical reader of imitating their style and taking up a pen name too close to their own, to the point that even the newspapers could not distinguish the genuine article. A merchant might accuse a colleague of targeted, malicious, cutthroat competition, of not only constantly adjusting their prices, but of intentionally setting up shop directly opposite them...\nAlmost everyone claims to be wholly in the right, appealing incessantly for the support of passersby in the hope of swaying the crowd and winning their case in the court of public opinion.\nMost of the time, such disputes are settled with relative ease, either by Gardes or by Gestionnaires rushing onto the scene. But there will always be a minority of claimants who, acting with ulterior intentions, will obstinately press for court proceedings just to get their name out there.\n\"I'll see you in court!\" comes the challenge. When things reach this stage, any hope that the voice of reason might prevail starts to buckle under the unstoppable force of emotion, neither side willing to give an inch as they begin to square off for a legal showdown.\nUntil, that is, an exasperated Gestionnaire standing by — long since having given up any hope of successful mediation — interjects in a tone of despair:\n\"Alright, I respect your right to take this to the courts. But before you do, you must make the following preparations...\"\n\"...Once judgment is pronounced, if you believe the verdict to be unjust, you may propose that the matter be settled by a duel.\"\n\"To my knowledge, the most recently rostered Champion Duelist is Miss Clorinde...\"\nAs soon as the name of Clorinde is mentioned, all bickering comes to an abrupt halt.\nFor all are well-acquainted with the name of this undefeated Champion Duelist. Beneath her blade, all despicable deeds that aim to capitalize on mere fortune under the guise of decency will show their true colors — and she has never once known defeat in a duel.\n\"...Ahem. Oh, uh... I suppose there's no need to go that far, is there?\"\nThus are such marketplace altercations, undercut by ulteriority, temporarily dissipated. Watching the two self-seeking merchants leave the scene with their tails between their legs, the Gestionnaire lets out a knowing laugh, then gives the younger, still uncomprehending colleague beside them a pat on the arm, and says:\n\"You see, the sword is mightier than the pen, after all.\"",
            "Character Story 1\t\"If you find yourself facing Clorinde, you'd be better off accepting your verdict immediately.\" Whether you heard it from the mouth of one who had known the misfortune of facing Clorinde themselves, or someone who had merely watched her dueling from the safety of the stands, there's next to no chance that this would have been said in jest.\nTake some of those who lost their duels with her in under a minute, for instance. A young lady who sought to prepare by tightly wrapping lengths of cloth around her hand so that she would not lose her grip on the hilt of her sword. Before she knew it, the strips of cloth had been cut off one by one with pinpoint precision, and her weapon sent spinning up into the air with such ease that it resembled a sewing needle. Or those flustered \"gentlemen,\" somewhat of a recurring type, who turn up sporting all sorts of hidden gadgets from head to toe — pistolets stuffed into their hats, daggers in their shoes, powder bottles up their sleeves. Once their tricks have been spent, they end up being thrown on their backsides without exception, now facing the additional charge of \"contempt of court.\" And that's not even to mention those desperate individuals who, by leveraging all means available to them, seek to curry favor before the duel has even begun, painting themselves as victims in a vain attempt to win the people's sympathy. But this doesn't change the inevitability of their defeat in the dueling ring. After all, a sword tarnished by a sheath of lies is no use for cutting anything.\nBut there is a benefit to the existence of this motley crew of failed scoundrels and slapstick comedians — namely, they serve as counterexamples helping the crowds recognize those others who are willing to duel with real honor, and when there is indeed some truth in the \"justice\" that they proclaim. Even if such a person ends up losing, people will listen to what they have to say — for they see that this is someone who stands firmly by their beliefs, and has the courage to draw a sword in their defense.\nSome say that when Miss Clorinde fights such individuals, she holds back slightly and never uses her full strength. A member of the audience, having once witnessed such a duel up close, even swore up and down that he saw the corner of Miss Clorinde's mouth curl up very slightly in what must have been approval. And surely, it is only in facing such opponents that the true meaning of the word \"duel\" is given its full expression, no?\nBut Clorinde cares not whether the audience is moved by her duels, nor to hear the internal monologues they might inspire.\nAs far as this Champion Duelist is concerned, the only meaning to be taken from a duel comes from facing your opponent on fair terms to determine a winner, a loser, and the righteous cause.",
            "Character Story 2\tClorinde cuts a dashing figure during duels, and her bearing has won her many admirers.\nThese \"enthusiastic\" citizens have carefully analyzed every aspect of this Champion Duelist's being.\nWhere did she learn her skill with the blade? Was it passed down through her family, or acquired unexpectedly? Might the explanation for her outstanding swordsmanship be that she is the last in the line of some fallen dynasty that once practiced the art?\nIt is said that she performs a \"sword cleansing rite\" before each of her duels. But with what does she cleanse the body of her sword? Water of the highest purity, drawn directly from the Fountain of Lucine? Some kind of special cleansing ointment? Or could it be that, to strengthen her connection to her weapon, she even adds a touch of... her own blood?\nNo, no, no! The great power of this \"rite\" surely lies not in the mere cleansing of her sword, but rather in her calling upon the spirit of some master swordsman to possess her, thus explaining her unbroken streak!\nFor a time, the figure of this undefeated Champion Duelist became shrouded in all kinds of colorful stories, driving the citizens (mainly the journalists, to be precise) into a frenzy of gossip and curiosity.\nFinally, driven to exasperation by all the reporters hiding in the bushes and flower beds by their main entrance, the court authorities assembled the journalists and released an official statement:\n\"The weapons and methods employed by Miss Clorinde in her duels — and this goes for all our other Champion Duelists too — are entirely mundane, and not, as rumor would have it, imbued with exaggerated powers of any kind...\"\nA wave of indignation spread through the audience, their expressions making clear that they remained utterly unconvinced.\n\"If such unfounded rumors begin to exert a pernicious and malign influence on public opinion, the courts reserve the right to formally bring proceedings against those deemed responsible for fabricating and propagating said rumors...\"\nThis threat was met with disdain by the journalists, whose Kameras continued to shoot away without any sign of stopping.\n\"...Let it be known, responsibility for the execution of the duties of Champion Duelist for all relevant trials is hereby entrusted to... Miss Clorinde!\"\nWith this, the journalists fell silent all at once.\nTo this, Clorinde — who, having been forced to attend this farce of a press conference, was sitting off to one side — nodded and replied:\n\"Of course. That's my job.\"\nAnd so were the absurd rumors about Clorinde finally brought under control. Nowadays, the only traces of that storm of conjecture still to be found are contained within the pages of a few daring theater scripts and edgy novels.\nBut were you to confront any one of the playwrights or novelists concerned, they would, without exception, firmly deny any taking any inspiration whatsoever from those rumors.\nNope, absolutely no connection to those old fabrications whatsoever, none at all!",
            "Character Story 3\tIn truth, those rumors that Clorinde had been dabbling with supernatural forces were indeed completely unfounded.\nThe formidable fighting talent of this Champion Duelist had its origins instead in the legacy of a group that once hunted down phantoms throughout the land of Fontaine: the \"Marechaussee Hunters.\"\nLegend has it that at the time of Fontaine's founding, there was a hero who went by the name of \"Golden Hunter.\" To wipe out the monsters that threatened the peace of Fontaine, it was he who founded the Marechaussee Hunters, gathering a band of heroes — among them the descendants of the Lochknights — to hunt down monsters and villains across Fontaine, leaving behind countless heroic legends in their wake. Yet once peace had finally been restored throughout the land, the name of the \"Marechaussee Hunters\" gradually fell into obscurity.\nToday, when the people of Fontaine speak of the Marechaussee Hunters, most know only of the \"Hunter's Oath,\" having heard it mentioned in some play or novel.\n\"From this day, I pass the candle's shadow-veil.\"\n\"Now, as we face the perils of the long night...\"\n\"I pledge to remember the oath of daylight.\"\n\"To enshrine tears, life, and love.\"\n\"Holding dawn's coming as my votive.\"\n\"And so shall I never despair.\"\nFor most Fontainians, the story of the Marechaussee Hunters is now but a legend full of drama and excitement.\nBut to Clorinde, the deeds and oaths of the Hunters are her living, breathing inheritance.\nThe first thing she learned from her mentor, the Marechaussee Hunter Petronilla, was the swordsmanship required to slay monsters. The approach of the Hunter requires them to stay as close as possible to their prey so that they might plunge their blade into weak points with lightning-fast agility. To train her in this technique, Petronilla consigned Clorinde to a room filled with rotating pillars, each of which had been set up with many wooden swords protruding outwards, their tips covered with cloth bags.\n\"They might contain candy, or they might contain metallic sand. Or perhaps they'll contain all the hair I've lost while teaching you...\"\n\"You can chop open these bags or simply avoid them. I'll leave you to make that call.\"\n\"Seeing as you've already had lunch today, you might as well keep going all the way through to dinnertime. Remember, try to reserve enough strength to eat. Alright, begin!\"\nBy undergoing such training, Clorinde not only developed the Marechaussee Hunter's skills of marksmanship, tracking, camouflage, and footwork, but also learned their method of quickly revealing their identity when encountering fellow Hunters in order to avoid accidental injury.\nYet Clorinde has never mentioned the hardships she endured during her training to anyone else. After all, she is now a Champion Duelist of the Trial Court, not a Marechaussee Hunter from centuries past.\nShe trusts that her mentor, who left without so much as saying goodbye, would understand her decision. The Marechaussee Hunters once wielded their swords to slay fierce monsters in defense of Fontaine's peace and stability. It is only natural, then, that their inheritor should do so to strike down lawless villains.\nEven if her mentor had objected, Clorinde would not have minded settling their debate in the time-honored fashion of the Marechaussee Hunters.\nAfter all, as Ms. Petronilla once said herself, if Clorinde could defeat her, she'd be willing to listen to the latter's dissenting opinion.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen the boss of the \"Tabletop Troupe\" first saw Clorinde visiting his club, he was at a complete loss as to how to react.\nBefore him was the legendary Champion Duelist herself, complete with tricorne hat, impeccable uniform, even pistolet and sword hanging by her waist. For a time, memories of mistakes he'd made in his past (some of which were not even technically mistakes...) flashed before his eyes, interspersed with frightful fragments of duels he'd witnessed. With the \"Welcome!\" he'd normally have greeted a new face with stuck in his throat, all he could do was stand there, not knowing what to say.\nAfter much consideration, just as this \"Welcome!\" was about to come out as \"Please, have mercy!\" Navia, who had followed Clorinde in, laughed and began to speak.\n\"My friend here has expressed an interest in experiencing the Tabletop Troupe for herself! So, how about it? Any fun scripts you'd recommend?\"\n\"She's no beginner though. She can be very picky about script quality, so make sure it's the best one you've got!\"\nTo give the boss some credit, though he still failed to produce any semblance of a \"Welcome!\" he did manage to turn \"Please, have mercy!\" into something... Well, not quite as embarrassing, at least.\nNamely... \"Uh!?\"\nHe then proceeded to rush about like a headless chicken, gathering up nearly all the scripts in the store. He brought them everything from their most popular script, \"Era of the Bronze Oath,\" to their most complex story, \"Chronicle of the Spiral Ring,\" to the irreplaceable classic, \"Valley of the Gray Wolf: 3rd Edition: 2nd Expansion\"...\nAfter this somewhat unorthodox \"ice breaker,\" the Tabletop Troupe suddenly found it had a new regular: Clorinde. Following an initial period where they were likewise immobilized by astonishment, the other customers gradually mustered up the courage to invite her to play the latest scripts with them. Presented with such expectant invitations, she said yes to them all.\nThey were soon to find out that, regardless of which script they played, this \"new player\" invariably demonstrated an unparalleled aptitude for roleplaying. No matter how small, she never missed a single clue in the script, nor the chance to make the most of it, following up leads with precision so that the story would develop in the most natural way imaginable.\nOn top of this, everything that Clorinde did was always completely in line with all the rules. Many of those who have played with her have come away expressing sentiments along the lines of: \"Miss Clorinde's so in control, it feels like she's a Game Master rather than another player like us!\"\nHearing such things, Clorinde would only ever give a noncommittal smile in response. It's not like she could admit that the only reason she found it all so easy was that she'd been the Game Master for Navia's scripts all this time — and thanks to her friend's endless barrage of weird and wonderful ideas, had been thoroughly trained in the art of quick thinking — could she? It would be such a long, complicated thing to explain...\nBut after having enjoyed the experience of being just a regular player, Clorinde decided to take up the mantle as Game Master once more, if for no other reason than to save the Tabletop Troupe's own, entirely blameless Game Masters from being perpetually tormented by Navia's endlessly active imagination. And for the boss, the other customers, and even Navia herself... it turned out to be a critical success!\nAfter all, no one in the room could claim to understand the meaning of \"impartiality\" better than this Champion Duelist. No bribes could sway her when she was presiding over a script — not even cake, fries, or Bulle Fruit!\nIn the face of such temptations, she'd simply watch as the players racked their brains for a solution, then flip over the rulebook and reply: \"We've still got plenty of time. Keep thinking.\"\nWhen yet another script reached its conclusion under Clorinde's masterful guidance, a certain young Gestionnaire turned to their companions, laughed, and said:\n\"And to think, we all used to imagine that Miss Clorinde spent the entirety of her waking hours dealing with duel-related matters!\"\nAs she tidied up the table, Clorinde stopped to think for a moment, then with a slight shake of her head, responded:\n\"I don't tend to work evenings.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tAs Clorinde sees it, there is no difference between the duties of a Champion Duelist and a Marechaussee Hunter.\nMarechaussee Hunters fought to defend the peace of Fontaine by hunting down monsters that ravaged the land. As representatives of Fontainian law and order, Champion Duelists punish criminals who attempt to exploit its loopholes and shortcomings for personal gain. Moreover, their existence not only gives those who wish to defend their honor the chance of a fair duel, but also an opportunity to speak for themselves.\nBut once the dust has settled and the wrongdoers have all been punished, what are those who fight for justice to do with the swords they took up in its name?\nPetronilla once told Clorinde the tale of a Marechaussee Hunter who became obsessed with exterminating monsters. When the day came that the land had been cleansed of their shadow, it didn't take long before he began to feel lost. After a life spent hunting monsters, what purpose did his life have now that their mortal enemy had been vanquished? After giving the matter much thought, he decided to carry on living as he had, severing his connections with the Marechaussee Hunters so that he might continue hunting down monsters alone... Petronilla did not say what became of him in the end, only the following:\n\"When a sword has forsaken its scabbard, the most it can hope for is simply to rust away.\"\nThis seemed to confuse Clorinde, who was still a child at the time. Seeing this, Petronilla raised up the coffee spoon in her hand, then pointed it at a cube of sugar and asked:\n\"Clorinde, can you tell me what this is? This is an important question, now. You'll get a glass of Bulle Fruit Juice if you can answer it correctly.\"\nClorinde blinked, then with a slight hint of uncertainty in her voice, answered: \"It's... a sugar cube?\"\n\"So you are on the ball then... Remember your answer, Clorinde.\" replied the veteran Marechaussee Hunter. \"When someone points at a sugar cube with a coffee spoon, they want you to focus on the sugar, not the spoon they're using to point at it.\"\n\"The whole reason that the Marechaussee Hunters fight is to restore peace to everyone's lives. Of course, this 'everyone' includes themselves.\"\n\"The sugar cube you're after is a happy, peaceful life. Fighting is merely the spoon you use to get it.\"\n\"Remember what you're fighting for, and never let the means become the end.\"\n\"Otherwise, you'll turn into the fool who sees only the spoon, not the sugar — and your coffee will forevermore taste unbearably bitter.\"\nAs dusk fell, the first lights began to illuminate the Court of Fontaine. People rushed to and fro across the city, scenes of mirth and merriment all over.\nClorinde sat there finishing off the last drops of her coffee, Café Lutece's latest creation. She'd been intrigued when she heard that the base was made from fresh, in-season fruit juice instead of the usual syrup they use to neutralize the taste.\nTomorrow's my day off, she thought to herself. I'll get a good night's sleep, then head out early to buy some flowers and fruit. I'm meeting Navia in the afternoon over at the Tabletop Troupe to play through their latest script.\nLooks like it's going to be a busy day...\nSpearing her last crumb of cake, the undefeated Champion Duelist popped it into her mouth, savored its exquisite texture, then stood up and left.",
            "\"Marechaussee Hunter's Legacy\"\tIf you're looking for the most characteristic element of Clorinde's outfit, look no further than the coat-tail cape that hangs down behind her.\nFor Clorinde, this cape is a \"keepsake\" in the truest sense.\nWhen she was but ten years old, the mentor who had trained and looked after her, Petronilla, left without saying goodbye. Even Mr. Callas, who always seemed to know everything, hadn't the slightest idea where the Marechaussee Hunter had gone. Not only did Clorinde turn the whole room inside out; she also went back to all the places where she had once trained to search for clues; but in the end, there was nothing that might indicate where her mentor had gone. In all her searching, the only thing she found was a long, slim, dark blue cape hanging in the closet.\nClorinde had never seen her mentor wear this cape before; she always wore a black one. Even if Clorinde had somehow managed to forget this, the Gardes who Petronilla had often run rings around — combined with all the wanted posters pasted on walls throughout the city — would have reminded her anyway.\n...But on the inside of the cape, you could clearly make out the unmistakable imprint of the Marechaussee Hunter's insignia. There was also a necklace with a dagger-shaped pendant that had her name carved into it — a belated birthday gift, it seemed.\nBut this cape and the insignia upon it... Were they really a parting gift, or just another one of her mentor's tests?\nClorinde couldn't tell, but she kept the items nonetheless.\nIf it was a test, then she'd do everything in her power to prepare for the final trial that awaited her.\nEven if the trial should span the rest of her life.",
            "Vision\tWithin the first five minutes, Clorinde had disarmed the examiner. At first, he simply looked like his patience was wearing thin; but now, all that was left was shock. It wasn't long after before she'd left the three other duelists, who had rushed down upon hearing the news, speechless in the dueling ring. The normally cold and cheerless courts were soon bustling with excitement, almost to the point of becoming unbearably loud. The \"Duelist's Trial,\" which in theory was only supposed to last three rounds, was — thanks to the enthusiasm of the duelists — fast developing into a fully-fledged \"King of the Hill\" gauntlet. Clorinde had no objection to this, her only reply being expressed through the sword in her hand. From start to finish, there wasn't a single moment where it seemed to flag or lose its edge.\nFrom then on, all that Clorinde had to do was apply herself to learning the various rules and other ins and outs of being a Champion Duelist... whilst simultaneously taking part in all kinds of duels.\nThough Clorinde's reputation of being undefeatable soon became known by all, and many of her opponents would rather surrender immediately than face her, she still wasn't an official Champion Duelist.\n\"Your swordsmanship may well be flawless, but be that as it may, fighting a duel isn't always so simple.\" said those veteran Champion Duelists. \"You'll also need to undergo a special... or shall we say, less one-dimensional combat challenge to prove that you're up to the job.\"\nThough Clorinde didn't understand what this meant at the time, several days later, she was forced to take part in the first truly challenging fight of her life.\nHer opponent was a wealthy merchant who was known to her. This gentleman had been accused of employment abuses, not only arbitrarily cutting his laborers' wages, but completely ignoring their health. The divers he'd hired, being wracked with all sorts of unbearable illnesses, could stand it no longer — hence why they had teamed up to bring this merchant to the courts. And the verdict had already been pronounced: Guilty of exploitation, beyond a shadow of a doubt.\nBut the merchant demanded that the trial be settled by combat, insisting that the whole affair was an unprecedented slight toward his reputation:\n\"Who else but I would be willing to hire these people?\"\n\"If I'm put away, they'll all starve to death! Kind, merciful souls, surely you do not wish to see this happen?\"\n\"Who among us is not afflicted by physical ailments? I myself, after spending so much time poring over accounts and other documents, have nearly lost my eyesight! I even bought them medicine, found them doctors... They just won't admit it!\"\nWith countless articles containing these claims circulating throughout the Court of Fontaine, they soon became the talk of the town.\n\"Hmm... He does make a good point...\"\n\"Although... Hmm. Could it be that they really weren't telling the truth?\"\nOn the day of the duel, a vast crowd of citizens — some well-meaning, others simply curious — converged upon the dueling ring. When the wealthy merchant appeared, he waved to the stands as a sign to those in his pocket. Seeing this, they began to cry out:\n\"This gentleman has been falsely accused! Let us not stand for such slander!\"\nOthers muttered to those around them:\n\"If you ask me, there's no way those people were telling the truth...\"\nBeset on all sides by such shouts and murmurings, the ordinary citizens of the crowd began to waver, and like a landslide gaining momentum, before long they too had been infected by the mob mentality.\n\"Surely we can't just stand here and watch as a good person is unfairly persecuted?\"\nHearing what the audience was saying, the young Clorinde felt lost and confused, like she'd been plunged into the depths of the ocean. She hesitated, hand resting on the pommel of her sword, unsure whether she should draw it or not.\nHe's been tried, and the evidence was conclusive, she said to herself.\nBut everyone seems convinced that he is in the right.\nThe wealthy merchant had already drawn his sword, and was now walking towards her with a triumphant air.\n\"You can hear them, Miss Clorinde. I am a virtuous, generous, and kind-hearted man, just as they say.\"\n\"Without good people like me, the Court of Fontaine would cease to function.\"\nWhen the merchant raised up his sword, the gold ornamentation and the precious gems set upon its hilt gleamed brightly, bedazzling to behold. For a brief moment, Clorinde caught his gaze as it reflected off the shining body of this resplendent weapon.\nAll she saw there was pride, arrogance, and empty bravado.\nIn that moment, she knew that his sword-arm was no match for hers, nor could its wielder use it to persuade anyone. The sumptuous jewels with which it was encrusted were nothing more than a facade to hide his lies.\nIt was as if a stray dog had covered itself in branches and thorns in a vain attempt to disguise itself as a vicious beast — a pathetic sham indeed.\nWithin a split second, Clorinde had severed that magnificent sword in two, and when the sparks died out a moment later, it was clear to all that this fight was over. With this, the crowd was silenced.\n\"Justice revealed the truth to me, and I witnessed it with my own eyes.\"\n\"In this place, honor is proven by the sword alone.\"\nAs Clorinde raised her sword and spoke these words, the merchant simply stared back at her in disbelief, beholding his own horrified expression reflected upon the Vision which — having seemingly appeared out of nowhere — now hung by her collar.\n\"Or did you never have the courage to fight for your honor in the first place?\""

            "Chat: Status\tAh, I'm feeling alright today. I'll take the chance to try and get some more done than usual.",
            "Chat: Memory\tWhen I don't have much to keep me occupied, old thought patterns start to creep back in, and— Soon as I start talking about it, the flashbacks start...",
            "After the Rain\tEven though the rain has stopped, you still need to watch out for puddles. Just like how the past stays in the memory, long after... Ah, ahem, sorry!",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tWhen you hear thunder, it's best practice to stay away from tall trees. Rangers must also be on the lookout for any signs of a forest fire.",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tThe weather's not bad. Let's get some sun! Hehe, after all, it's excellent for your health.",
            "When the Wind Is Blowing\tAhh, the wind is perfect. Not too light, not too strong... Hehe, I bet Amber would be itching to test her limits in this weather.",
            "Good Morning\tGood morning! *yawn* Sorry, I was catching up on my studying again last night...",
            "Good Afternoon\tIt's quite normal to be out until midday on the longer patrol routes. I brought a few extra Pita Pockets — would you like one?",
            "Good Evening\tIt's getting dark out. You need to be extra careful if you're going through the forest at this hour.",
            "Good Night\tAre you ready to get some sleep? Okay. The campfire's lit — I'll keep watch tonight.",
            "About Collei: Forest Ranger\tI wandered the wilderness for quite a long time before arriving in Sumeru, and I've eaten everything out there countless times — edible or not. Since I'm familiar with the wilderness, the work of a Forest Ranger seemed a natural fit for me when I arrived here. If they did courses in wilderness survival, I'm pretty sure I could pass... well, as long as there was no written test.",
            "About Collei Herself: Cram\tHmm? You wanna know what it is that I'm studying every day? ...Y—Yes, my master is a brilliant intellectual, but no, he's not teaching me anything heavily academic at the moment. It's, um... heh, \"Basic Literacy in Teyvat\"...",
            "About Us: Old Friends\tAmber's mentioned you before in her letters. I can't believe how much has happened in Mondstadt since I was there. Too bad I had to skip the words I didn't know, so I missed out on a lot of details... Oh, but since you're here now, would you be willing to tell me the whole story?",
            "About Us: New Friends\tI used to think that I'd never make a single friend in my whole life, but things changed when I went to Mondstadt... Then after that, I met Master in Sumeru. Now I've met you, too. All in all, I think I've been really lucky.",
            "About the Vision\tI never thought there'd come a day where I get my own Vision. In the past, I used to think that the gods only cared about people who were born popular... Um, but I was in a bad place back then. Sorry.",
            "Something to Share: Skill Names\tMaster is always reminding me that practice makes perfect, so I sometimes try reading some light novels to improve my reading ability... Because they're at least easier to read than Master's essays. But recently, I was reading this book where the main character has loads of different skills. Each one has a name, and I didn't know a single word in any of them... Hmm? The title? I think it was, um... \"Onibudou\"? Have you read it before?",
            "Something to Share: Sealed Power\tUgh... Here we go again: \"The power sealed within me grows restless\"... and \"You'd be wise to stay away from me\"... Why are people in Inazuma casually coming out with lines like these all the time? Doesn't it embarrass them when they think back on it later? Aaah... no, it's too cringey. I can't read any more of this!",
            "Interesting Things\tWell, there's plants and animals, there's ones you can eat and ones you can't, but beyond that it's all much of a... uh, muchness really? ...Shh, don't tell Master I said that. Although... personally, I guess I quite like trees that have a hollow in it? Especially in those moments where I just want to curl up in a ball and hide away. Everyone must have moments like that, right? ...No?",
            "About Tighnari\tAlthough Master can be quite stern and is always criticizing adventurers for carelessly eating poisonous mushrooms, he is actually a gentle soul. He's so patient when he tutors me, and he even reads out letters from Mondstadt for me. I've always been very grateful to him.",
            "About Dori\tI ran into her once on forest ranger duty. She pulled out a bottle of fruit juice from her bag that looked really tasty, as if she somehow knew I was thirsty... Fortunately, Master was there, and he stopped me from spending all of my hard-earned Mora in a moment of weakness...",
            "About Lesser Lord Kusanali\tThe Dendro Archon... When I was a kid, there were so many times when I just wanted to scream out to the gods and ask them why, why did I have to go through so much pain...? *sigh* But, for all I know, maybe the gods feel just as helpless about everything they have to endure as I did back then.",
            "About Cyno\tUm... I'd rather not talk about him, if that's okay? Oh, no — the General Mahamatra isn't a bad guy or anything. Matter of fact, I have him to thank for bringing me back from Mondstadt to Sumeru and finding me a safe place to stay. It's just that... whenever I'm reminded of the sealing process just before leaving Mondstadt... ooh... the back of my neck starts hurting again...",
            "About Kaveh\tThe General Mahamatra once brought him to our place for a meal. From the moment the fruit arrived on the table, he ranted non-stop about his difficult and stubborn roommate for the entire meal. We didn't get a single word in the whole time. We just nodded along and tried to stifle our laughter. It took a lot of effort.",
            "About Nilou\tShe seems a little absent-minded. If she ever comes to perform around Gandharva Ville, I'm worried she'll end up wandering off into the forest and getting lost... So I'll have to watch out for her, as a responsible trainee forest ranger should.",
            "About Amber\tAmber is amazing. She's friendly and has tons of enthusiasm, plus she's really brave and always does the right thing... She's the person I admire most of all! She's like a cozy fire that makes everyone around her feel warm. There's no way I'd be where I am today without her... So much time has gone by — I bet she's even more cool and confident than ever these days! Who knows if I'll ever be able to match her.",
            "About Kaeya\tHow's everyone in Mondstadt, are they good? I caused so much trouble back then, I sometimes wonder if I should make some time to go back there and apologize... Hmm, but what if I ran into the Cavalry Captain, and he started teasing me? ...Yeah, there's no rush, maybe I'll leave it a while longer.",
            "About Lisa\tAfter all this time, Lisa still calls me \"Little Collei\" when she writes to me. I feel like by now she... hmm? She calls you \"cutie\"? Hahaha... Sorry, I don't mean to laugh, um... but I must say, that makes me feel a lot better.",
            "About Fischl\t...\"Prinzessin der Verurteilung\"? ...Mmm, nope, sorry. I wasn't in Mondstadt for very long, so I didn't hear of her. That name, though... *grimace*... Ahem, nothing.",
            "About Faruzan\tUm... To be honest, I don't really know how to handle people like Madam Faruzan... She's always saying that I'm a hardworking student and eager to learn, but that's because I have to be! I'm a slow learner, so I have to put in the extra effort. Oh, there was a time when I accidentally saw her research journal — only for a second, though. It was all written in old script, and I couldn't even make out half of it... Definitely the scariest book in Teyvat!",
            "More About Collei: I\tYou wanna know more about me? If you mean about before I came to Sumeru, then, um... M—Maybe you could write to Amber and ask her about it? Wait wait wait, no, not that. If Kaeya found out, that would be a disaster. What am I saying — of course he'd find out! O—Okay, I'll tell you myself, then. Whew... I'm sorry! Please give me a few days to work up to it...",
            "More About Collei: II\tWhen I ended up in Mondstadt, I said a lot of things to Amber and the others that I shouldn't have. I still feel ashamed whenever I think about it... How could I talk like that to people who were just trying to help me? I shudder to think what they must have thought of me back then... Uhh, sorry, maybe we can leave it there for today? If I go any further than that, I know I'll regret it tomorrow.",
            "More About Collei: III\tI was once taken to someone they call \"The Doctor\" for treatment for my Eleazar... well, actually \"treatment\" is the wrong word — it was more... experimentation. After so long in that place, I couldn't help but start to wonder, what have I done wrong to deserve this? Why won't anyone come to rescue me? Gradually, I went from hating just the Fatui to hating everyone in the world. Thinking about it now... it was quite childish.",
            "More About Collei: IV\tThanks to you guys, my Eleazar has disappeared without a trace. It's the miracle that I never dared to wish for. ...I never held out hope for a cure, I just figured I'd try and just do as much as I could before my body stops moving. First I was focused on revenge, then forest patrol... and now, finally, I am free to live my life.",
            "More About Collei: V\tAre you going to keep traveling? Let me do my part, please? I'll study hard... whether it's reading, medicine, combat, or assessing the danger... even something small, like checking the streetlights! I hope that many more people will get the help they need along the way... just like how you saved me.",
            "Collei's Hobbies\tMy hobbies? ...Sewing, practicing gliding, and helping people! Hmm? Sounds familiar? Well, that's because... I want to be someone that gives people that warm feeling, too.",
            "Collei's Troubles\t\"In response to the homo— homogenization of crop species... taken import measures... avoid long-term consumption of fungal foods...\" What is the point of all this... They're literally saying, \"I don't wanna eat mushrooms,\" but because they're from the Akademiya, they have to make it sound all complicated!",
            "Favorite Food\tPita pockets are travel-friendly and filling, so they're probably the food I eat the most. But if we're talking about more than just \"filling,\" my favorite food would be... mmm, Fried Radish Balls, I think.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tDuring my wandering days, there were times when I had to crack open Wolfhooks and force them down if I didn't want to go hungry, so there aren't really any foods that I especially hate. If I had to pick one thing that I won't touch, it would be mushrooms of any kind. Nothing to do with the flavor — I just don't want to ever be the one on the receiving end of one of Master's stern lectures...",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tMmm... It's delicious! Could you teach me?",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tWith skills like this, I bet you never go hungry when you're out in the wilderness, huh?",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tSorry, Master says I'm not supposed to eat anything that looks suspicious.",
            "Birthday\tUh, H—Happy Birthday! Here's the cake I made for you, and here are the candles, so yeah... Amber said in her letter that this would do the job... Oh! And, and here's the gift I got for you!\n...I'm sorry, I don't have much experience arranging birthday parties. I have no idea if you'll like it... Aah, I'm getting all flustered now. If anything's not how you like it, please say, and I'll make absolutely sure to plan a nicer birthday celebration for you next year!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tDoes this mean I'm making progress?",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tI'm starting to feel like... I'm finally a better person than I used to be.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tEven if it's a life-or-death situation, I'll never need to rely on their power again.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tIt probably wouldn't even matter if I unsealed that power now — I've come so far, I think I'd be able to control it, don't you? Well — only one way to find out! Hu-uh!\n...Just kidding. My real superpower is all about the adventure experience I've had with you.",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\t\"Helpful,\" \"bright and sunny,\" \"friendly and passionate\"... Just ask around Gandharva Ville, and you'll hear this Trainee Forest Ranger praised to the skies in such terms.\nAs long as her body allows, no matter how busy school gets, Collei will never slack off when it comes to her forest patrol work, and is always willing to lend a warm helping hand to whoever is in trouble, regardless of what walk of life they are from.\nNevertheless, even as enthusiastic and positive as she is, there seems to be a past and things on her mind that she is not yet ready to reveal to others.\nIf in the woods where she often patrols, you should chance upon a tree hollow full of strange notes, or hear someone whispering nearby...\nNo matter what you witnessed or overheard, please kindly take a detour and consider it a silly prank — one played by an Aranara, perhaps.\nAfter all, there are some things that only a tree hollow can know — for now, anyway.",
            "Character Story 1\tIf words are the vehicles of wisdom, being literate is undoubtedly the starting point of the pursuit of knowledge. Collei, however, seems to have only barely reached the foot of the mountain of knowledge.\nWhen she first arrived in Gandharva Ville, even the outspoken Tighnari showed obvious hesitation, making repeated inquiries with the General Mahamatra if she had walked through the wrong door, since he had yet to make any plans to teach preschool level courses.\nStill, after several twists and turns, Collei did finally become a trainee. To facilitate her learning of words, Tighnari gathered a wide assortment of books and documents, in the hope that Collei would soon master enough words through extensive reading.\nApart from the literacy encyclopedias for children and the mandatory-reading academic papers that made her head swell, Collei can most often be found reading fairy tale picture books from Mondstadt.\nThe logic is simple: those books tend to have fewer words and more pictures. Even if you do not know the words, chances are that you can still guess their meaning by looking at the illustrations.\nHowever, reading only children's books hardly sufficed to keep up with her curriculum. Once she had picked up slightly more words, she immediately started to look for new extracurricular reading materials.\nAccording to some travelers who had passed through Avidya Forest, there was a type of book in Inazuma known as the \"light novel,\" which was easier to read than academic papers, and with fewer illustrations than picture books. To Collei, that sounded like the exact type of book she needed.\nMore importantly, the plots of these \"light novels\" were often so incredibly riveting that as soon as they got a copy, many readers just had to finish reading it in one go, even if they had to stay up all night.\nThat definitely sounded tempting to Collei, since she had to force herself, more often than not, to stay awake long enough to finish her readings.\nOne day after her forest patrol, Collei excitedly ran back to her dormitory with the newest volume of \"Onibudou.\" She was so ready to pull an all-nighter reading the light novel — and as it turned out, she indeed stayed awake that night.\n\"My sealed power!\" \"The lonesome avenger!\" \"You'd be wise to stay away from me!\" \"I shall never witness the grace of the gods!\"...\n—Covering her head with the quilt, Collei tossed and turned upon her mattress the entire night. Even as the dawn broke, she had not yet torn her mind away from these words.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere is a saying in Teyvat that has obscure origins and is often used by people who are feeling extremely ashamed or embarrassed:\n\"I just wanted the tree to open up and swallow me.\"\nCollei was pacing in the woods while murmuring the sentence, which she had just learned from a book.\nBefore she returned to Sumeru, she had promised a dear friend that she would become an excellent doctor with exceptional medical skills so as to save people like her who were in constant agony, both physically and mentally.\nHowever, it takes only a passing passion to make a wish, and yet it requires years of painstaking training to realize it. In the examination that had just concluded, Collei had hit the barrier between reality and expectations once more.\n\"Ugh... How am I supposed to tell Amber about this...\"\nPlus, she would have to ask her master to write the letter for her. Things like doing poorly on the test and wanting to have someone to talk to were not things she could easily speak out in front of her master, either.\nIt just so happened that a tree hollow, roughly the size of a person, appeared along her patrol route, as if some god had overheard her mumblings.\n\"Wait, wait... Talking to Aranara about my problems... I mean, I've read about it in the books, but they were children's books! I'm sure I've outgrown that... But now that there's no one around...\"\nBefore she knew it, she was already crouching in said hollow.\nThe darkness turned into a solid fortress, isolating Collei from all kinds of pressure.\nCollei, being an introvert by nature, found it difficult to present herself impeccably. No matter how hard she strove to be as outgoing and sunny as Amber, she could never manage to ignore her weariness and loneliness.\nThus did Collei vent her distress to that hollow, emptying herself of all the negativity she had accumulated after getting back to Sumeru.\n\"Did Collei go on patrol in that area again?\"\nA few days later, Tighnari checked on Collei's recent forest patrol routes, which she had been taking all too frequently, before looking at her test papers, which featured remarkably higher scores. He could not help but think to himself:\n\"Did she find a way to improve her grades in the forest? Well, that's not bad either way. Alright, I'll save that patrol route for her and leave her be for the time being. I'll have other Rangers take the other routes.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tShould written tests be left out, Collei actually does well on her exams, especially when it comes to \"surviving in the wilderness.\"\nThe jungles of Sumeru suffer no shortage of poisonous creatures and dangerous beasts, while unexpected emergencies lurk around every corner. Therefore, a competent Forest Ranger must be a thoroughly-prepared one.\nAnd Collei really exceeds in this regard. She may not be as literate as her peers, which hinders her performance in all the written tests. Yet, she is nothing if not practical and creative.\nWrapping thorny vines around her boots to increase traction, rubbing the toxic sap of poisonous mushrooms onto hunting traps to promote efficiency...\nSuch ideas have ensured that she can travel in and out of the jungle safely, successfully extracting those unfortunate enough to become lost in the woods, accidentally ingest poison, or get hit by a running beast.\nThose who have been rescued by Collei are, one and all, amazed by her unique but reliable survival skills — not to mention how they are all moved by her genuine kindness and enthusiasm.\nBe it surrounded by grave dangers, or lacking food and supplies, even if the rescued traveler turns hysterical, she embraces every circumstance with the warmth of the sun.\nShe cares little for scars, and hunger concerns her not. She just wants to offer help to whoever is in need.\nThe only thing about her that is considered unacceptable by many is the recipes she utilizes during times of crisis: as long as they can replenish her energy, she will even gladly swallow fireflies without hesitation — the crushed pits of Zaytun Peaches are even less of an obstacle.\nWhen people meet her, they simply cannot help but wonder about this young trainee's past.\n—What sort of experiences could make such a seemingly innocent girl see the wilderness as her home?",
            "Character Story 4\tBefore returning to Sumeru, Collei had wandered for a long time.\nThe decisive difference between wandering and traveling, of course, lies in that the former bears no designated destination.\nHer wandering started from those charred ruins, or perhaps earlier, when she was afflicted with that disease, and it was long destined to be a never-ending nightmare extending into nothing but total darkness.\nMost of the companions with whom she had fled from the ruins either lost their way in the endless waves of sandstorms, or corroded to death by divine remains.\nSick and cursed, they had nowhere to stay, thus turning to uninhabited jungles and wildernesses.\nMother Nature is both merciful and cruel. She would never reject them because of their illness, nor would she offer whatever they need even if they cried out for it.\nAs more and more of her companions could walk no further, the lessons they left behind helped the rest become better at surviving in the most desperate situations.\nAnd when Collei's last companion could no longer continue, she learned yet another lesson: never to reach out to anyone again.\nAt that time, the two of them had their backs against the cliff, utterly exhausted. Yet, they could still hear the beast roaring from not too far off.\nPerhaps it was because of the narrow passage, if not for other reasons, but her only remaining companion bumped into her, sending her careening off the cliff.\nFortunately, Collei managed to grab a tiny twig in her panic, before stretching out her other hand and shouting for help.\nHowever, that companion merely glanced at her with a complicated look before escaping alone without hesitation.\nShe did not get far, the beast's howls outpacing her fleeing steps like a raging wind. The beast's pure predatory instinct caused it to overlook the shivering Collei, who was barely hanging onto the cliff.\nCollei quietly withdrew her hand and held on tightly to the branch that might break at any moment, until all the sounds above her head died down.\nThe roar of the beast and the screams of that companion had all disappeared.\nShe could not hate that companion. If she were in that person's shoes, she could not guarantee that she would have made a different choice.\nAt that moment, there was only one thought remaining in Collei's mind.\nBe it to offer help or to ask for it—\n\"I will never reach out to anyone again.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tCollei once again touched someone's hand during a certain year's Ludi Harpastum in Mondstadt.\nThe city was elaborately decorated with lights and lanterns. The streets were jam-packed with people. The sky was getting darker, and the stage was in full swing.\nA girl in flaming red just grabbed her hand, took her out of that cramped wooden box, and squeezed into the crowd.\nPeople gathered around, cheering and applauding the contestants who were playing hoops or with slingshots.\nCollei could not relate to them. No matter how well they could play these most childish games, what use were they in hunting game out in the wild?\nYet, the girl with her was extremely passionate about these little games. She would cheer and whoop at every victory, and hand out the prizes she won to the children.\nCollei was even more baffled. If not for the rewards, why would anyone participate in these activities? Was there really any fun in them?\nSo she sneaked to a corner and picked up a slingshot to try her hand at it — in the end, one of the more than ten shots she fired eventually hit the edge of the target.\n\"Yay! I hit it!\" Collei turned her head excitedly. \"Hey! Did you see...\"\nIt was only then that she realized that she had been there for quite a long time and the girl in red had already left.\nIn the days that followed, Collei had been practicing day in and day out. Gradually, she became more than familiar with the sounds of drawing a bowstring and throwing darts. She practiced for a long time, until she would seldom miss a shot out of ten.\nEvery time she pulled the bowstring back, Collei remembered the excitement of hitting the target for the first time on that night.\nAnd that when the girl grabbed her hand and ran towards the crowd, her palm was as warm as the sun.",
            "Cuilein-Anbar\tTo grow up is to best one's immature past self.\nCollei often helps the children in Gandharva Ville mend toys, and her Forest Rangers colleagues also occasionally ask her to help patch their clothes when they get torn up by branches.\nThat said, Collei was by no means born a seamstress. As a matter of fact, her first attempt at sewing was nothing short of a disaster.\nIt was when Collei was about to leave Mondstadt. Right before she left, she handed a piece of repaired old clothes to Lisa, hoping that she could return it to its original owner, Amber, on her behalf.\nThe piece was indeed repaired, but also covered in stitches so twisted that one could potentially mistake them for earthworms. In all likelihood, it was no longer possible for its owner to ever wear it out again.\nShe was afraid that Lisa would laugh at her or criticize her.\nTo her surprise, Lisa just gently took Collei's hands, hidden as they had been behind her back, and carefully bandaged the injuries.\nShe was not even slightly surprised by all the injuries, deep or shallow, on Collei's fingertips. She just casually commented, \"Why, it almost looks as if someone's been bouncing Wolfhooks across their hands all night, as if they were balls.\"\n\"Don't be this impatient with your studies in Sumeru, little Collei,\" Lisa said with a smile. \"There's always a first time for everything, and learning to overcome the difficulties you encountered during that first time is where the meaning of growing up lies.\"\nCollei instantly blushed. She had not quite learned how to accept the kindness of others back then.\nBut she was just a child, and children grow up.\nThe desperate child would grow up and discover hope once again. A child who could not use a slingshot at all gradually learned how to aim.\nThat child who was once constantly injured by a needle has also slowly grown up to be an ingenious role model in the eyes of other children.\nIn Gandharva Ville, children gather around Collei, chittering with envy and excitement.\n\"You're so skillful! What a pretty cat!\" \"Collei, does it have a name?\"\nCollei, for once, felt so proud of herself. She held up the exquisite cat doll, all fine stitches and perfect needlework.\n\"This is — Cuilein-Anbar!\"",
            "Vision\tThe rain was pouring. A surge of rock, earth, and debris had blocked Collei's way back.\nCollei lit a bonfire by the cliff, trying to warm the shivering girl next to her.\nThis river valley would require a full day's journey from the woodlands that were the domain of her usual patrols. If she were here all by herself, it would not be entirely impossible to get back in this rain.\nBut now that she had a child with her, wracked by cold and hunger after being lost in the woods for a long time, she had to wait.\nThe girl looked pale, her forehead boiled, and she kept murmuring her mother's name.\nCollei still remembered the girl's mother, who had been anxiously and desperately seeking help in Gandharva Ville — she recalled the look on her face, the look of one who wished that she was in suffering instead of her daughter. Collei knew that look.\nThe family had been traveling with a caravan to cross the river valley. As they were camping and resting, her playful daughter had run off, straying into the deep forest. As soon as the caravan noticed that the child was missing, they tried their best searching for her, but it was all in vain.\nIn desperation, the mother had to return to Gandharva Ville to look for help.\nRecently, Tighnari had been attending meetings in the city with other Forest Rangers, and the situation before her was critical — Collei could not wait for any of them to return. Nor could she rely on the search and rescue dogs during such heavy rain.\nSo she immediately grabbed her pack, bow, and arrows, before diving into the forest alone.\nAt that moment, the occasional low growl against the sound of thunder and rain told her that there were beasts approaching.\nCollei could not help but recall some disturbing experiences from her past. Old memories came flooding back, the memories she least wanted to face.\nBut the rain would pass, and after receiving the news, Tighnari rushed over without taking any breaks.\nTraces of fighting could be found all the way along the cliff. Several beasts lay fallen in the distance, while Collei and the girl slept peacefully on each other's shoulders.\nTighnari's heart seized up in his chest. He was well aware that Collei was not capable of doing all this — unless she had wielded power that should not be unleashed.\nIt was like drinking poison to quench thirst, and it would surely aggravate Collei's condition. He must contact the General Mahamatra right away...\nTighnari's footsteps awakened Collei. She hurriedly gestured to ask her master to quiet down so as not to wake the girl next to her.\nTighnari checked upon her worriedly, \"Collei... Did you...\"\nCollei shook her head. She raised a hand and released the fist that had been clenched all night.\n\"Master, I've become stronger! I won't let anyone's efforts go to waste — from now on, I'll protect everyone.\"\nIt was a Vision, silently glowing in her hand."

            "Character Details\tAs the leader of all matra, General Mahamatra Cyno is well known to everyone in the Akademiya.\nHis duties are to arrest those who violate the Akademiya's rules and regulations, terminate illegal studies, and uphold discipline of the Akademiya. Nevertheless, researchers feel that this General Mahamatra does nothing but undermine academic progress and prohibit scientific research. Some even claim that he is \"cutting off the path to knowledge\" and can be seen as a dire threat to any researcher eager to seek knowledge...\nOver time, researchers have come to shrink away from Cyno in silence whenever they so much as see him, wanting to have nothing to do with him.\nBut the General Mahamatra is hardly bothered by such things.\nIf this exaggerated public image can really deter some researchers, that will in no way be an inconvenience for his work.\nPlus, in the words of that Forest Watcher friend of his,\n\"The research conducted by most researchers is nowhere significant enough to result in a talk with a matra.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tWisdom can bring enlightenment to scholars, but can also lead to utter arrogance.\nIn the history of the Akademiya, many researchers have used their \"wisdom\" to commit crimes.\nFor example, in order to test the limit of the Specters' body inflation, one Amurta researcher adopted an illegal catalyst and created a mega-sized Specter, which later exploded during the experiment and leveled the entire research center. Then, there was a researcher from Spantamad who had aimed to test a Ruin Guard's ability to cultivate fields, but lost control of the modified machine, resulting in the ruin of many farmlands and grave injuries for several farmers. There have also been numerous criminal cases concerning academic fraud and the abuse of intelligence for personal gain...\nSuch researchers, who do not abide by the law and pose dangers to others, will all be pursued and judged by the matra led by Cyno.\nWhen they stand before the matra, these researchers will almost always spare no effort to justify themselves. Their reasons have included but are not limited to suddenly cut funds, the Akademiya's favoritism towards other researchers, the results of their work being stolen... Some may even accuse the matra of stopping them from completing their research out of jealousy of their talents.\nCyno's response to such sophistry is always to stay silent and press forward in subduing all those garrulous criminals and sending them to trial.\nThose who violate the rules can always come up with a million excuses. However, only one ending awaits them.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe name of the General Mahamatra has traveled well beyond the Akademiya's walls.\nAccording to a Forest Watcher in the Avidya Forest, he once caught a glimpse of this General Mahamatra quietly traveling through the woods in the middle of the night. A person living on the outskirts of Apam Woods can still clearly remember how a white-haired teenager asked them for a bowl of water, before venturing deep into the forest alone with just a traveling pack on his back. Adventurers resting in Sobek Oasis claim to have given directions to Cyno, though the area he was heading to had been packed with monsters. Even the proudest mercenaries and Treasure Hoarders in the Great Red Sand dare not make things difficult for the General Mahamatra, having learned this lesson well from the example of a mercenary group that was annihilated in the desert for sheltering wanted researchers.\nHowever, for those criminals who have fallen into the hands of Cyno, their reverence for the General Mahamatra usually comes from another aspect of his character.\nWhen escaping from the Akademiya, criminals tend to flee in an extreme panic, and can sometimes stray into perilous places. Yet, instead of letting them suffer the consequences, Cyno will come to their rescue without hesitation, just so that he can bring them back to the Akademiya to face their proper punishment.\nOnce, a criminal who had crossed the Great Red Sand with Cyno asked him about the point of doing all this. Cyno replied,\n\"Only the law can judge you, and my role here is to bring you to face the scales.\"\nAfter being released from prison, the researcher, who had been a Vahumana graduate, turned their adventures returning to the Akademiya into a novel titled \"The Goon,\" which remains a bestseller in the Akademiya. The researcher was even invited by Vahumana to give a lecture, during which they went into great detail about the portrayal of \"justice\" in the book.\nIf you ask Cyno, however, he would say that certain parts of the book were heavily exaggerated. In truth, they did not encounter any monsters created by the descendants of King Deshret, nor did they stray into a living labyrinth at the bottom of the desert or survive a sandstorm in the folds of a humongous Wenut.\nNevertheless, Cyno did appreciate the candidness with which the author described their own crimes, and would like to remind them to not commit such crimes ever again.",
            "Character Story 3\tIn the Akademiya, the mere mention of the matra's office can make any researcher's heart seize up.\nApart from the renowned \"evil deeds\" of the matra, what disturbs them even more is how creepy, dry laughter can be heard from the office whenever Cyno walks in...\nResearchers firmly believe that this must be the matra's way of expressing smug satisfaction at the sight of Cyno passing judgment on some hapless researcher.\nBut only the matra know that the laughter is a response to Cyno's unique sense of humor.\n\"I once worked on a case where the researcher involved was under great pressure because his paper had been rejected multiple times at the review stage. He eventually rammed it through by successfully bribing the members of his review committee. However, the data in that paper was so wrong that it didn't even take long to be exposed as academic fraud. When I went to arrest this researcher, he asked me 'what have I done wrong?'...\"\nAfter a pause, Cyno continued,\n\"I answered, 'Your paper.'\"\nSeeing the matra all sit there in silence, Cyno seemed to be worried that they did not get the joke, so he went on to explain it with a serious expression,\n\"You see, the interesting part of this story lies in how, when he asked me what he had done wrong, he expected me to say that his fault lay with his bribing of the committee due to academic pressure, yet I told him that his error was in not reaching the correct conclusions in his paper. The clever part about this joke is that I changed the subject that was being discussed...\"\nAfter he finished explaining, the matra all exchanged looks before letting out a few dry, strangled laughs in concert...\nThe awkward laughter lent a strange sense of human warmth then to the often somber and solemn matra office.\nHowever, to prevent such an awkward situation from ever happening again, the matra gradually came to a consensus that after Cyno finishes telling a joke, everyone in the room must force out a laugh or two in response so that he will not start explaining it.\nOn the other hand, any matra who attempts to imitate Cyno's style will be harshly punished by the others through extreme means such as confiscating their canteen meal tickets.\nAfter all, one Cyno is enough for the whole division.",
            "Character Story 4\tCyno has always believed that the matra are not the enemies of those who seek knowledge.\nCyrus, a scholar who tutored Cyno before, once told him that without the Akademiya's laws, \"wisdom\" will soon turn into \"calamity.\"\nThese floating scraps of out-of-control \"wisdom\" are like bait on a sea of ignorance, luring innocent knowledge seekers into the abyss.\nThey will make researchers far too arrogant and reckless, to the point where they may even attempt to tamper with life and death due to their lack of respect for human life. Eventually, they shall cause irreparable damage to the world.\nThe sages keep introducing new rules and regulations precisely to ensure that the knowledge seekers of the Akademiya will not be misled and go astray because of such bait.\nThe matra who hunt down those who violate the law and judge them according to those same laws are in fact the \"guardians\" of all those who seek knowledge in the Akademiya.\nHowever, in the eyes of researchers, they are but a bunch of \"demolishers\" who constantly, violently cut off their paths to knowledge.\n\"Dumb humanoid Fungi,\" \"Mr. You-Can't-Do-This,\" \"Paper Shredders\"... These are all nicknames they have come up with for the matra.\nAmong them, the most notorious one is \"the Akademiya's Sumpter Beasts,\" a name coined by a Haravatat researcher.\nWhen they first heard of this nickname, most of the matra were rather enraged, reckoning that the researchers thought too little of their hard work.\nOn the contrary, Cyno noted that he actually fancied it quite a bit.\n\"We matra are indeed Sumpter Beasts who walk the Akademiya's halls, carrying the rules and regulations on our backs.\"\n\"When exercising our rights, each of us must always keep that weight in mind.\"\nAfter pondering the matter for a while, this General Mahamatra added,\n\"Plus, we could stand to be more like Sumpter Beasts in avoiding pointless arguments and focusing on, ahem, getting to our desired destination.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tWhen the Akademiya was first established, its researchers wielded their boundless imagination and innovation to the fullest with the abundant resources available at their beck and call.\nThey had reshaped terrain, controlled the weather, recreated ancient relics... But when the knowledge of the earth could no longer satisfy their insatiable curiosity, some researchers turned their focus to the starry skies, whereas some others attempted to tamper with life and death.\nHowever, these kinds of knowledge were not things they should or could have touched upon.\nTo prevent researchers from being devastated by their own knowledge, the sages laid out six cardinal sins.\nThey held that all the crimes in this world derive from these six sins.\nThe first is to interfere with human evolution;\nThe second is to tamper with life and death;\nThe third is to delve beyond the universe;\nThe fourth is to investigate the origin of words;\nThe fifth is to revere gods without acts of devotion;\nThe sixth is to attempt the forbidden and fear none.\nSince then, the sages have been introducing new rules and regulations according to these six deadly sins while amending and revising old ones. The matra enforce the laws, and the researchers perform their roles accordingly as well.\nIn this way, everything in the Akademiya functions in a desirable manner, and the Akademiya and its researchers have been marching forward with thriving clarity of wisdom ever since.\nAs time has passed, the six ancient sins seem to have been forgotten by most, and ambitious people have been on the move since...\nHowever, for Cyno, the current General Mahamatra, what he ought to do has not changed.\nHe will, according to the six ancient deadly sins, justly judge all the lawbreakers.\nEven sages shall not be exempt.",
            "Cyno's Genius Invokation TCG Deck Box\tThis deck box, which contains Cyno's Genius Invokation TCG deck, is his favorite physical possession.\nThe exterior of this deck box is wrapped with multiple layers of high-quality leather, and every seam has been carefully handled. As long as the rope fixed on the leather remains tightly tied, the entire deck box will be completely sealed, and not even a drop of water can get through. The interior is padded with silk, which can minimize the bending of card corners. According to the shop owner, the silk used was all imported from Liyue and made from top-quality Silk Flowers. This deck box even comes with a tough leather strap, so the buyer can easily affix the box to any part of their body. The surface of the deck box is even engraved with the Genius Invokation TCG emblem and the name of one who purchased it.\nCyno has put his strongest deck in this box. He believes that as long as he gets to duel with this deck, he will be nothing short of invincible.\nOf course, the next thing to do is to find a couple players who are willing to play against him.\nHmm... Would that Forest Watcher be available at the moment?",
            "Vision\tWhen it comes to how Cyno got his Vision, many versions of the story can be found circulating in the Akademiya.\nSome say that he was once instructed to arrest a researcher who had been studying methods of making counterfeit Visions. The researcher had previously bought a masterless Vision for research, which then became Cyno's Vision. Some believe that Cyno is actually a descendant of King Deshret. They say that he grew up in a temple located in the Great Red Sand and was raised by a nameless Hermanubis priest who cultivated Cyno's will and strength before, when he was ready, bestowing upon him a Vision and requiring him to cross the desert all by himself to arrive at the Akademiya and enact Hermanubis' will. Of course, according to some conspiracy theories, Cyno's Vision is closely connected with certain forbidden technologies hidden within the Akademiya. Otherwise, how could this member of the desert ilk earn a spot in the Akademiya?\nNo one dares to check any of the stories' authenticity with Cyno in person, and Cyno himself cannot be bothered to waste energy on these ridiculous rumors.\nThe truth is that the way he obtained his Vision was rather simple.\nIt was the day before he was about to become the new General Mahamatra. As per usual, after finishing his work as a matra, Cyno went to the library to read books relating to the Akademiya's rules and regulations. He can still well remember that the book he was reading that day mainly talked about the six cardinal sins that the sages had decided on, which they held to be the origins of all crimes and thus served as the foundation for all the modern rules and regulations of the Akademiya. While he was reading the chapter on \"to attempt the forbidden and fear none,\" he failed to fathom some chunks of the content depicted in the book, so he closed his eyes and ruminated. The moment he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a Vision, laid nicely on the page.\nCyno looked at the Vision and fell into contemplation. He first confirmed that there was no existing rule that prohibited someone from being granted a Vision. Then he went over several academic cases with Visions involved and ensured that this Vision was not some malicious trap. He went on to ponder the challenges he might encounter after becoming the General Mahamatra and how this Vision might help in these future trials... After carefully weighing up the pros and cons, Cyno finally accepted this gift from the gods earnestly.\nBy then, the morning light was already shining through the windows. Cyno left the library with the Vision and his as-yet-unfinished read in hand before heading over to the location where he was to be inaugurated as the General Mahamatra.\nIf all went well, in half an hour, he would become the Akademiya's new General Mahamatra.\nHe was about to be entrusted with the sacred power to judge those who had erred, and this Vision would ensure that this sacred privilege could be exercised as intended."

            "Character Details\tThe term \"Eremites\" does not reference a specific group or organization, but all those who are born of the desert and ply a trade using their martial prowess, operating as mercenaries.\nFrail is humanity in such a desolate profession. To survive, those who walk the path of a mercenary will naturally come together, forming loose bands of mercenaries.\nThough the Eremites are many, few among them will be remembered as legends, with most bound to be as evanescent as sand in the wind. Yet there are exceptions who, like Dehya, may linger in the annals of history.\nThe \"Flame-Mane\" Dehya is fierce and brave, the lion her moniker invokes an analogy for her might. The nickname itself, meanwhile, denotes her passionate nature.\nShould you be planning to hire a mercenary to serve as a bodyguard, Dehya stands as a prime choice. Procuring her service runs an expensive premium, but her abilities make that a worthy expenditure indeed.\nCompared to those overconfident fools hawking their talents as hired blades on the street and novices capable of little more than brute force, Dehya is a conscientious professional.\nWith all this said, those who wish to procure her services should make haste, for there is a long line of other potential clients that have need of the Flame-Mane, and the opportunity, just as grains in the desert, will slip away before long.",
            "Character Story 1\tAll desertfolk, including Dehya, learn to master and comprehend the sands.\nHere, where the blue of the sky is boundless, where the gold-paved waves of the sands bleed into the cleft of the horizon, it is easy to feel how small one truly is.\nEven those familiar with the sights and scenes of the desert can be intermittently shaken by the forces wielded by nature, and find themselves yearning to profess their supplication upon the sands where they were born.\nThe feeble and meek fear this land, and only those strong of spirit can find themselves drifting free upon this golden ocean.\nAmongst the desertfolk, the bravest, most inured to the cruelties of their existence amidst the flowing sands are the mercenaries — The Eremites.\nSuch a life is one with little comfort or ease, so what a mercenary truly desires are those who can support them, with such covenant-kin being the equal of blood relatives.\nIn her youth, Dehya's family consisted of her father and his mercenaries.\nAs she grew to independence, her new family was the \"Blazing Beasts,\" fellow mercenaries she could trust and count on.\nAfter battling together for a time, a tacit understanding forms between individuals, with entire thoughts conveyed with but a movement, a gaze.\nLater, as she temporarily bid the desert farewell to commit to a commission in the rainforest, she often found herself reminiscing about the moments she spent with her companions, singing by the fireside.\nShe can rise as high as the sky or stray as far as the sea, but Dehya was and will always be a daughter of the sands.",
            "Character Story 2\tBefore one makes any individual comparisons, broadly speaking, females are slightly edged out by males in raw physicality.\nDehya, likewise, was not born with immense might. Even so, the other mercenaries have a great many reasons to hold her in high regard.\nFirstly, though she is not the strongest in her profession, she has force enough all the same.\nShould one doubt this, they merely need to test the weight of her blade. To make such a greatsword dance and flow without sufficient strength would be impossible otherwise.\nSecondly, she has tremendous combat instincts. It is known that the greatsword, Dehya's weapon of choice, demands a trade-off between force and speed. Should such a weapon fail to achieve a decisive first strike against a sufficiently mobile foe, it will prove more burden than a boon for the wielder. In moments like these, Dehya uses her superior insight and technique to overcome the opposition.\nSometimes, she will cast her weapon aside, eschewing the edge of a sword for the weight behind her fists. She will even hurl her weapon at foes without warning to buy a fleeting opportunity. How any such moment plays out all depends on the actual conditions presented by each battle.\nAside being good in a fight, she also knows plenty about surviving in the desert.\nThe commissions that the Eremites most often take will have them serving as bodyguards against raiders without outside support, herding away dangerous creatures, and assisting their clients in avoiding dreaded weather conditions.\nSometimes, they even find assignments that have them acting as guides, helping caravans, adventurers, and researchers reach their desired destinations.\nDehya knows how to deal with startled scorpion swarms, how to circle around vultures to avoid getting entangled with those nimble annoyances, and how to negotiate and minimize danger when faced with robbers.\nClients like it when matters are handled thoroughly and practically. To earn true praise from their employers, mercenaries must offer more than just brute capacity for violence.\nIndeed, the ability to overcome one hundred or even a thousand foes has its limits, for when sandstorms scour the earth and sky, even the mightiest warrior will be buried beneath its shroud.\nA wise mercenary knows when to retreat, and how to preserve themselves even while meeting their objectives, for doing so exemplifies the true heights of strategy.",
            "Character Story 3\tAs Dehya's reputation gradually grew amongst the Eremites, those of her band grew proud of the fame she was earning and, during a day when everyone happened to be present, the rowdiest of her companions stated their desire to grant her a nickname worth remembering.\nEveryone agreed that they would announce Dehya with the new nickname whenever she won future battles, so it needed to be something spectacular — capable of spreading goosebumps through people like a skin-raising plague.\nThe youngest members gave their all trying to come up with something. They chittered and clamored, trying to give Dehya a vicious moniker capable of instilling debilitating terror in potential clients, usually beginning with \"bloody\" or \"terror.\"\nDehya was not such an amateur as to think that a title alone might encapsulate the entirety of what others felt about her. But still, as if everyone wanted to kill some time on this matter, she didn't mind.\nAs she listened to bad suggestion after terrible suggestion, she couldn't help but guffaw with laughter. The atmosphere reminded her of moments from her childhood when her father gathered his compatriots to put on plays for her, detailing chivalrous heroes defending the helpless or messy brawls between siblings to amuse everyone. There was no specific point to it, except to bring some cheer while surviving in the vast emptiness under the desert's midnight sky.\nAnd just as the chatting was starting to put her in a good mood, that old ne'er-do-well's shadow slid back into her mind. Though admittedly disgruntled, Dehya did her best to keep the curl of her lips imperceptible.\nThat night, Dehya rejected several laughable names, such as the \"Sovereign of the Sands\" and \"The Crimson Edge.\" She thought it was time to let the farce come to a close. It was just a name after all, and true mercenaries did not let such things affect their business much.\nJust then, an aged mercenary interrupted the discussion. At first, he snorted disdainfully at the stupidity of those around him. Then, he asked a question: \"The Legend of the Lion. This story ring a bell for anyone?\"\nThis tale was, naturally, one Dehya was familiar with. During her childhood, her father had told her lots of old stories — far too many, really. She had wanted to forget everything that had to do with him, but memories are not so easily consigned to oblivion.\nWhile she was lost in the twists and turns of her past, her companions decided upon a title for her that actually sounded quite alright: \"Flame-Mane.\"\nAnd though she loathed the man The Legend of the Lion reminded her of, she found herself halted just before she could reject the name. Was it not all too petty to refuse such goodwill on that account?\nMust she avoid all the things related to her father, just because she wanted to forget him? Of course not. Besides, the story had brought a genuine feeling of warmth and comfort to Dehya, allowing her to face the world with open eyes, experience all it had to offer — and those experiences had not been falsehoods.\nSo why not take up the title of \"Flame-Mane?\" She could have done far worse.",
            "Character Story 4\tDehya is an individual of immense beauty, a fact undeniable to all who know her.\nShe is blessed with eyes of frosted sapphire capable of shivering souls, honeyed skin that bears a nigh-resplendent gleam when greeted by sunlight, and a length of wavy, black-and-gold hair that drifts behind her with every light-footed step she takes.\nThe desertfolk hold maidens imbued with attractiveness and vigor in great esteem, seeing them as embodiments of vitality.\nDehya, likewise, pays a great deal of attention to her looks. When she finds the opportunity, should her environment allow it, she always seizes the chance to take a shower and part her person from the stench of sweat. During her leisure time, she hits up the market for personal care products, procuring powder for her eyes and face alongside other cosmetics for times when she might need them. With how she uses these consumables daily, she often finds her supply depleting rapidly.\nMercenaries are typically a crude bunch, accustomed to violence with little focus placed on how they present themselves, making Dehya something of an oddity in that regard. Unable to understand why she is so concerned about her appearance, some of her companions have asked her as much.\nWell, what else could it be? The men of the desert smell so foul — a stench only made worse when they kick off their boots — that the nausea that follows is near-debilitating.\nCoated with sweat, having not washed their feet for the better part of a month, and reeking of alcohol, they infuse the air in a room with unfathomable rankness.\nImagine, an entire room filled with such unsanitary individuals. Mighty though Dehya might be, she has little desire to spend her time choking for breath.\nAs such, she sticks to a number of ironclad personal habits that separate her from the many slobs who plague their trade, leave her employers with a good impression, and keep her looking good at all times.\nA portion of her hard-earned Mora, likewise, is always placed into getting jewelry and cosmetics. She treats such purchases as rightful rewards derived from fruitful labor.\nWhen one is constantly surrounded by such fatiguing things as weapons, enemies, and business, a little care and gentleness go a long way toward lowering her defenses, allowing her to face the coming future with a softened heart.\nThough it is true that Dehya is a ferocious mercenary, she is, always first and foremost, a lovely and carefree woman.",
            "Character Story 5\tUnlike many who leave the desert and never look back, Dehya has always been proud of her heritage. However, her identity has indeed also introduced a great many obstacles into her life.\nShe lacked a systematized education and was in turn also bereft of any complex technical knowledge besides that which had to do with martial prowess and desert survival. Such was the case for many an Eremite mercenary.\nIt is clear to Dehya that this lack of knowledge has constrained her people and their potential, their energies and curiosity long subsumed by the sandstorms and the sweltering heat. If she hadn't encountered the miraculous creations of the Akademiya, tasted the fine wines of Mondstadt, beheld the elaborately crafted utensils from Liyue, or the mechanical brilliance possessed by the people of Fontaine, she too would have been unable to see past the borders of her environment.\nMeasured on merits of courage alone, the folk of the rainforest pale before the tenacious desertfolk. Avatars of determination, even after being lashed by the winnowing tongue of the withering winds for years uncounted, the people of the desert continue to live on, generation to generation, their bodies and minds as enduring as the rock of mountains, perhaps even more so.\nBut if they lack foresight to see beyond the present and visible, they will always only be crawling about in the sand.\nThe Mora they earn devoted solely to food and drink, their wealth flowing out as fast as it comes in, passing through them like the sand within an hourglass. The few among them who possessed foresight and intellect knew that to find a better life, changes were needed. But those individuals often cast the desert behind them upon embracing said better life, shifting to lives lived only for themselves.\n\"Why can't we be more? Why must we be bound to spending our strength — even our lives — to live just a little better?\"\nThey were made by the desert, but also shackled to it. Dehya desires to transcend such limitations. At present, she is still contemplating what kind of future she desires to seek.\nHow far someone can progress in life is not all determined by something as subjective as personal will — Dehya understands that all too well. But she also knows that, so long as there is a chance, she will try to deliver hope back to the desert, to do something for those still living there.\nThough her future paths may lead elsewhere, the sands will always be her home.",
            "The Legend of the Lion\tAccording to Kusayla, when a lion roars, even the blazing sun must shiver.\nLittle Dehya had never seen an actual lion before, so whatever Kusayla claimed, she heeded without question.\nKusayla would vividly describe how the sun would cleave the land with its heat, warping mud to powder and distorting the very air in the atmosphere. Despite this, the lion constantly thundered onward, striding across this burning plain. Try as the sun might, the lion's approach was constant and unrelenting, pursuing the star tirelessly with its roaring until the light finally fled past the horizon.\nSuch was the might of the lion.\nEnraptured by the story, little Dehya's eyes gleamed bright, brighter even than the campfire burning beneath a blanket of night.\n\"The lion can...\" Kusayla's eyes scythed about for a moment before he snatched one of his slimmer compatriots to use as a volunteer to complete his analogy. \"The lion can take out ten guys his size. Easy.\"\n\"What about you? Can you beat the lion?\" Little Dehya asked Kusayla.\n\"Hard to say, but I know quite a few tricks, so I think should be able to give that beast the business.\" Caution lit Kusayla's expression, betraying no hint of boasting.\n\"If the lion charges me, I'll... dip down beneath it, angle myself under its body, and then... Open its stomach with my blade. That should be enough to do it in.\"\nUnsatisfied with mere words, Kusayla called upon another of their band to pretend to be a lion, planning to give a personal performance for a triumph most hypothetical. Unfortunately, their acting left much to be desired, with the \"lion's\" roars crippled by a lack of presence, sounding more dog-like than anything.\nDehya was unsurprised. She knew what kind of character her father was. It was folly to take all he said seriously, and only disappointment awaited if one did so. All she really had to do was laugh along with him.\nThe Legend of the Lion, however, did linger in her recollections.\nMany years later, just as Dehya and her companions were deciding what title would sound best for her, the Lion was mentioned, pulling her back to this childhood fable, and her father, who had put everything into the form of a play for her.\nThough she had been estranged from Kusayla by then, she couldn't help but indulge in the nostalgia of her youth.\nNow, she finally understood what her father felt in his heart all those years ago, though he was now gone, adrift in the Eternal Dreamland.\nThis would prove one regret she would not be able to reverse. But still, one must veer toward optimism, for bitterness did not suit the lifestyle of one working in the desert. Besides, the memories of her preadolescence were now things she could openly look back upon with a sense of satisfaction.\nRecalling her girlhood, Dehya's eyes couldn't help but light up just as they had beside the campfire beneath the night sky all those years ago.\nShe would become a lion, akin to the one told of in Kusayla's story, so that the legend might yet live on through her.",
            "Vision\tDehya isn't all that sure when her Vision manifested precisely, but she guesses that it might have appeared when she had just started walking her own path.\nDuring that time, she was consumed with thoughts of growing stronger.\nAs a mercenary, being weak meant not being able to take on enough commissions, which in turn meant no Mora for food.\nIt was during this critical juncture that the Vision appeared by her side. With how stretched for Mora she was, she even considered trading it in for actual currency.\nPeople all say that to be granted a Vision is a sign of divine favor, but Dehya felt that if she was truly chosen, the gods would have sent her Mora instead of some trinket that lacked instant monetary value.\nAdditionally, though the Vision can help her direct the elements, victory in a true battle is still decided by skill, judgment, strategy, and physical conditioning.\nThere are many legendary mercenaries who achieved such renown even without a Vision, relying only on training and grit.\nDehya likewise understood that, should one become overcome by pride at having the gods' favor, stop thinking things through, and fail to appreciate that which is before them, no enemy would be required to punish such hubris. The desert itself would exact vengeance upon such folly on its own.\nThe things she would experience thereafter would serve as further proof that even divine power has limitations. For all their might and wisdom, even a god might be constrained.\nDehya likes her Vision, but she will not bend to become an apostle after a mere brush with divine attention.\nShe is a mercenary. Someone who lives and dies by the blade. Such a person trusts only in the sweat shed to feed countless gardens of battle and bloodshed."

            "Character Details\tAs the city of ballads and wines, Mondstadt's alcohol industry is renowned all over Teyvat.\nAs owner of the Dawn Winery, Diluc is essentially in charge of half the industry. This means he has a huge stream of revenue and an entire network of information, in the form of tavern patrons' gossip, right at his fingertips.\nIn a way, he is the uncrowned king of Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe scent of wine always lingers in the air in Mondstadt.\nIf one were to follow the scent to its source, one would invariably arrive at Diluc's Dawn Winery.\nA wooden plaque proudly announces the winery’s name, and beneath it is written the winery's motto:\n\"Shine True.\"\nMost interpret this to mean that the wines are brewed for consistency of taste, with time-honored techniques and that same healthy dose of sunny optimism that the dawn brings.\nMeanwhile, the more pragmatic Knights of Favonius are reminded of the long history of mutual support between the winery and the city.\nThe winery holds festivities from time to time. These events are routinely attended by enthusiastic fathers, eager to introduce their wonderful daughters to the young and single winery master.\nThis is all highly entertaining to the other guests, who watch on and comment, mockingly:\n\"We'd much rather Master Diluc stays married to the winery, given how good this wine is!\"\nDiluc deals impeccably with all situations, no matter who or what comes his way.\nDiluc is a fine young gentleman in every conceivable respect.\n",
            "Character Story 2\tDiluc avoids talking about the past.\n\"If only Diluc were still a member of the Knights...\"\nAfter a few drinks, senior knights will say words to this effect with a sigh.\nThey refer to events from a long time ago, back when Diluc's father, Master Crepus, was still the owner of the winery. Master Crepus' wish was for his son to become the most esteemed knight of all and safeguard Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.\nAs per his father’s wishes, Diluc trained rigorously to make himself worthy of the Ragnvindr name. Sure enough, he passed the Knights of Favonius' trials, swore the oath of protection to Mondstadt, and entered their ranks. Before long, he received an early promotion which saw him become the youngest-ever Cavalry Captain.\nOver the course of his missions and patrols, the denizens of Mondstadt gradually came to know this young and passionate Cavalry Captain.\nNo matter what the missions demanded from him, he always maintained his composure and his passion. No matter how big the challenge before him, his boundless courage always led him to the front line. The praise he received from his comrades and citizens spurred him on.\nBut the words of praise he valued most of all were:\n\"Good job. Now, that's my son.\"\nHis father's words fueled the fire inside his heart and served as his greatest motivation.\nHis faith was an unquenchable fire that burned strong and bright inside him.\nDiluc was so young back then.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"Sometimes, life can change in an instant.\"\nThe day that Crepus spoke these words to Diluc would turn out to be the latter's last as a Knight of Favonius.\nFor on that day, a horrific monster attacked the transport fleet he and his father were traveling with.\nThere was no time for Diluc to send for help. The monster was stronger than any foe the young Cavalry Captain had ever encountered, and overpowered him.\nDiluc could never have anticipated the way this battle would end: His father, who had been denied admittance into the Knights and who was shunned by the gods, defeated the monster with an unknown evil power — before that same power backfired, mortally wounding Crepus himself. Crepus died shortly after in his son's arms.\nWith a heavy heart, Diluc returned to the Knights' headquarters, only to receive an unthinkable order from Inspector Eroch: \"Conceal the truth.\"\nEroch insisted that the incident must be portrayed as an unfortunate accident in order to maintain the reputation of the Knights of Favonius in the eyes of the public.\nSuch was the sheer outrageousness of this request that Diluc did not think it was even worth trying to argue.\nDiluc's father had once said to him that the world would never turn its back on the faithful.\nBut now, the Knights of Favonius trampled on his faith like it was nothing. He couldn't help but wonder: What was his father's view on faith in his final moments?\nDiluc resigned from the Knights that day and left everything behind, including his Vision.\nHe swore to avenge his father's death, and to find the source of that occult power which had caused his father's demise.",
            "Character Story 4\tAfter Diluc resigned and discarded his Vision, he handed the running of the Dawn Winery over to the head housemaid and left Mondstadt altogether.\nDiluc traveled all across the seven nations of Teyvat in search of the truth.\nAll clues pointed toward a behemoth of an organization: The Fatui. He learned that they made counterfeit Visions in secret, calling them \"Delusions.\" A Delusion could amplify the power of its bearer to its extreme, but also carried the risk of backfiring. That was what had caused his father's death.\nWas it possible that his father could have obtained such a sacrilegious item in order to do good?\nDiluc knew he may never know the full truth, but that could never stop him from pursuing it.\nLike an eagle scouring the wilderness, he set off on his hunt for the truth. Determination burned like fire in his heart, unfathomable enigmas and unending battles could not sway him from his course. He pressed on relentlessly, scarred but undeterred, like a fiery tornado burning through the dense fog of mystery.\nThe Fatui's rulers, the Harbingers, monitored Diluc's progress from the shadows. The prowess with which he laid waste to numerous Fatui strongholds caught their attention and forced them to take action.\nDiluc narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Harbingers thanks to a third-party observer from the north, who was part of a vast underground intelligence network. The observer claimed to have been watching Diluc for some time, and approved of his methods.\nAfter his close encounter with death, Diluc took a long hard look at his past and the anger he had harbored for so long. Acknowledging his shortcomings, he decided to join the underground intelligence network.\nJust like when he first joined the Knights of Favonius, Diluc committed himself fully to his work. His talents and skills saw him rise steadily through the ranks into the upper echelons of the network.\nThe network was made up of volunteers, and many of its members had willingly given up their prior positions and reputations to join. Some had even abandoned their names.\nCould working with these new comrades finally restore the faith he once clung to? The faith that had been all but destroyed in the events surrounding his father's death?",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Shine True.\" The background to this motto is hotly contested, but to Diluc it has one simple, clear meaning.\n\"Evil cannot go unpunished.\nNever settle for mediocrity. Never forget that the dawn will one day come.\"\nDiluc's solitary sojourn lasted for three years.\nFour years on, Diluc had returned to Mondstadt and taken over as head of the family winery, now a young man.\nIn the space of these four years, Eroch had been purged from the Knights of Favonius after being shown to be a traitor, while Grand Master Varka had left on an expedition, leaving Master Jean to assume the role of Acting Grand Master.\nThe return of the Dawn Winery's master should have been a momentous occasion for Mondstadt, but strangely it went completely unnoticed.\nThe reason? Mondstadt's citizens were far too busy pondering the mysterious case of an unknown \"Guardian of Mondstadt.\"\nAll that was known about the anonymous guardian was that the smell of burning would follow in his wake, and that a flash of red flames would reveal his silhouette for but a moment in the darkness of the night, before he disappeared in an instant.\nThe bodies of monsters that had plagued Mondstadt for an age now lay dead in the wilderness... Mondstadt's most wanted thieves suddenly appeared bound and gagged, hanging from their feet in the statue plaza... All the Knights of Favonius were dispatched to reckon, once and for all, with the Abyss Mage behind countless crimes in the city, but they arrived only to discover that he had long since been killed...\nAided by wine-fueled conversations, word of the mysterious guardian spread swiftly, and he came to be known as the \"Darknight Hero.\"\nIn public, Diluc appeared to hold this hero in contempt, his face curling up in disgust every time the name was uttered.\nElzer of the Mondstadt Wine Guild was one of the select few who was in the know, and once queried Diluc about this: Was his disapproval of the Darknight Hero just an act, intended to throw the knights off his trail and protect his anonymity?\nBut Diluc simply frowned once more, and curtly replied: \"It's just a stupid name.\"",
            "Dawn Winery's Apple Cider\tDiluc may hold the whole wine industry in the palm of his hand, but he himself is not fond of wine.\nAt Diluc's request, the Dawn Winery developed several alcohol-free beverages, a decision which was met with resounding approval from those in Mondstadt who could not drink alcohol but still wanted to partake in the drinking culture.\nOne of those alcohol-free beverages is Mondstadt's Apple Cider, the success of which is on a par with Dandelion Wine in terms of monthly sales volumes.\nSome think that Diluc must have such high standards when it comes to wine that he is never seen drinking the mediocre-quality beverages that are available to the public.\nOthers think that drinking wine must surely remind him of his father, and that that is why he does not touch it.\nWhen pressed about his drinking habits, he responds by saying that alcohol clouds his thoughts, and consuming it would impact his day-to-day work.\nBut the thing that people don't understand is: What kind of day-to-day work does a winery master do, if it requires him to never touch a drop of alcohol?",
            "Vision\tCrepus had two regrets in life. One was never becoming a knight, and the other was never obtaining a Vision.\nFor this reason, in the moment that Diluc received his Vision, he took it as a recognition by the gods of his and his father's shared ambition — finally, he could make his father proud.\nJust a few years later, his father died on a dark and gloomy day. The hopes and dreams that burned bright in Diluc's Vision were extinguished in the torrential rain that fell on that night.\nNo matter how upright and good-hearted a person may be, death will still come to them without warning.\nIs this where the tale of justice ends? Just like that?\nIt seemed to him that his Vision and his status as a knight were both equally ineffectual at enabling him to protect the things that he treasured most. It was time to discard them both, he decided.\nWhen he recognized his own powerlessness, his Vision became but a burden, of no greater service than a Delusion.\nEmpty titles were of no interest to him. He sought after ardent flames that would burn brighter than any other, and an unshakable resolve. Only a firm resolve can drive the truth-seeker forward, and only ardent flames can vanquish the ice that freezes the hand of justice.\nOn the day that Diluc returned to Mondstadt, he took up his Vision once more. The events of his years away had purged him of his childish immaturity, and turned him into a hero ready to shoulder his father's will once more. Each night, from the shadows, he fought for Mondstadt.\nHe did not discuss the past. But he did not deny the past, either.\nTo the lost, perhaps a Vision is a beacon of light given by the gods to help them find the path forward.\nBut to those with conviction, a Vision is simply an extension of their strength, a medium for channeling their willpower, a tribute to the experiences that have shaped them, and a testament to the story of their life so far."

            "Character Details\tWhenever a guest walks into the Cat's Tail, they will immediately glance in the direction of the bar.\nBehind it often stands a girl with mildly-twitching cat ears, cocktail shaker in hand, and an unhappy look on her face.\nThis is the mixologist Diona, ascendant star of Mondstadt's wine industry, and the greatest challenger to its traditional powerhouses.\nHowever, she does not make these wonderful cocktails on purpose — indeed, quite the opposite.\nHer mixing methods can seem a little \"inscrutable\" to an outsider. To herself, Diona tries nothing less than her hardest to ruin that hateful grog.\nBut no matter the drink, it will turn out to be an unimaginably sumptuous brew so long as it passes through her hands.\nThis is a \"blessing\" she has received, though that blessing is a huge headache for her.\nFor this mixologist proclaims herself to be the \"Wine Industry Slayer,\" and her final objective is the utter destruction of Mondstadt's entire wine industry.",
            "Character Story 1\tComing to the Cat's Tail to serve as its bartender was really a prank on Diona's part, the first step in her master plan.\nWhen patrons came in, they would \"enjoy\" her look of disgust as they got ready for the \"Diona Special\"...\n\"Hmph. Here, drink this Sea-Salt Lizard, and kiss your life as an alcoholic goodbye...\"\nSo she would say, thus ruining these boozehounds' appetites.\nAnd yet...\n\"*glug*... *glug*... Wow, I have never had such a wonderful drink! Can I get a refill, miss?\"\n\"...You want a refill!?\"\nTo this day, Diona has struggled with her unbroken record of mixing fine drinks. Unable to accept defeat, she has yet to give up on her dream of producing something truly disgusting.\nHowever, the results are always the same, and the Cat's Tail remains a popular watering hole, with its pleased patrons singing praises unending of her skill.\nAll poor Diona can do is puff up her cheeks, tears forming in her eyes as she grumbles:\n\"Just you all wait!\"",
            "Character Story 2\tDiona's father, Draff, is the best hunter in Springvale.\nWith a resolute face, honed hunting techniques, and calm judgment calls, he fully deserves to be the leader of the huntsmen of Springvale, and is an example to them all.\nIn Diona's young mind, her father was her shining, perfect idol, the person she wanted to be.\nAnd that was also why she cried her heart out the day the pedestal she had put her father upon abruptly shattered.\n\"When he's drunk, he's like a wild boar rolling about in the mud!\" So she said, her eyes ringed red.\nBut Diona was not ready to blame this on her father's terrible drinking habits, for how could such a great father have such faults?\n\"It's the wine's fault! It bewitches people and makes them stupid!\"\nThis is the source of Diona's hatred for alcohol, and the beginning of Cat's Tail's turn in fortunes.\nThat said, Margaret, the owner of Cat's Tail, had never expected any of this to happen at all. Rather, she had a much simpler reason for hiring Diona.\n\"What choice did I have? She's just too cute.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tMany patrons believed that Diona's feline ears and tail were part of her uniform as a bartender.\nThis persisted until one day, when one particularly plastered fellow tugged her tail out of curiosity... only to find it unexpectedly warm and soft.\nThat day, Diona turned the tavern upside-down.\nThese feline features are the hallmarks of those with Kätzlein blood in their veins, and it is an exceedingly rare sight in Mondstadt.\nOther than such aesthetic similarities, Diona and her father Draff also owe their prowess on the hunt to this ancient bloodline.\nInfiltration, archery, climbing, and dodging... Diona required no teacher for such skills.\n\"Ah, yes, and she also has a pair of eyes that can see well in the dark.\"\n\"As for weaknesses... She bites when piqued, so please be careful.\"\nThus did Dr. Edith write of Diona in her notes for \"Studies Into Bloodlines Strange and Unfamiliar.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tDiona's appearance did indeed have an impact on Mondstadt's alcohol industry.\nThe Dawn Winery's long-held monopoly was broken overnight by this unexpected ambush from Cat's Tail, and the man put in charge of the winery's business, Elzer, found this unacceptable.\nA calculating veteran of many industrial battles, Elzer considered poaching this key figure, never realizing that Diona considered the Dawn Winery a sort of \"final boss\" to be defeated in her quest.\n\"This marvelous and bold method of preparation must be the secret of these flavors, yes?\"\nDiona simply looked at the white-haired man who had just sat down in front of the bar, rank displeasure in her eyes.\n\"Ah. Simply exquisite. I can just feel your incomparable passion and love for wine.\"\nDiona's hand started to tremble as it held on to her cocktail shaker, and detecting the change at once with his sharp gaze, Elzer understood immediately.\n\"If a brilliant bartender as yourself were to grace the Dawn Winery with your cooperation, we shall be able to bring Monsdtadt's alcohol industry to heretofore unseen heights!\"\n...When Diluc questioned Elzer as to the story behind his bandaged hand later, he was uncharacteristically hesitant to say anything.\n\"I... I was bitten by a cat.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThere is a legend about a \"spring fairy\" that circulates in Diona's hometown.\nThe fairy once saved a mother and son who had despaired beside a well, filling the barren hole with rushing waters that pooled and formed a spring. The child, deathly ill, was miraculously healed by those spring waters.\nMany people came to catch a glimpse of these blessed waters, and built a settlement around it, and left it not thereafter. Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.\nNowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.\nOnly little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.\nThese were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful — feelings worth answering.\nThat was what the spring fairy believed.\nSo, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.\nOn the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.\n\"I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow.\"\nFrom that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.\nTill today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream.",
            "Cold Cocktail Shaker\tDiona's father Draff is also interested in mixing the occasional drink.\nDiona's tail would wag from side to side of its own accord as she watched her father rocking the shaker back at forth at night.\nBut young Diona also found that her father would wind up particularly drunk on such nights, becoming dead to the world before he could even finish her bed-time story.\nThus, when Draff went out to hunt one day, she hid the shaker, squirreling it away in the deepest place under her bed.\nUnexpectedly, her father didn't bother looking for the lost shaker at all. He simply brought a new one back the very next day.\nWhen Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.\nEver skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift.\n\"Now, this suits you far better,\" Margaret said with a satisfied nod.",
            "Vision\tDiona's antipathy towards alcohol is not \"hate\" per se. Instead, it can be considered a form of \"avarice.\"\nShe wishes for her father to always be the man that she admires, and she treasures every moment that she spends with her family, unwilling to \"share\" her happiness with the wine.\nThere was once a storm that lasted for three days, and for those three days, her father, who had been out hunting, did not return.\nThe awful weather prevented the search parties sent by the Knights of Favonius from making much headway, and soon the dread of \"loss\" began to hang over Diona like a shroud.\nIf she could not even stand to \"share,\" how could she bear having something utterly \"stolen\" from her?\nShe burst out the door and into the tempest, and the waters that stood in her path were frozen by some power she did not recognize.\nUsing her superlative tracking skills, she found her father under a broken gorge.\nWith the help of the other hunters, she returned home with her father, and only once she realized that he would be fine did she finally smile again.\n\"Do you... want me to mix you a drink? It'll numb the pain a little...\"\nThat was probably the first time she ever mixed a drink in a normal fashion.\n\"Ooh, it's so refreshing. It's wonderful! Hahaha—Ouch...\"\nGetting to drink a cocktail that his daughter had made was probably a better anesthetic by far than the alcohol itself.\nStill, Diona gaining power over Cryo did not help reconcile her to wine at all."

            "More About Dori: II\tHehe, you've got a good head on your shoulders. I'll tell you a story about a merchant.\nA long, long time ago, a merchant lost her way while she was out on the road. It wasn't long before she encountered a Fog Div. Just as the Fog Div was about to eat her alive, she said in a panic, \"Wait, Mr. Fog Div! Don't eat me! I've got a story to tell you. Please, have a listen, and if you like what you hear, then perhaps you would spare me...\"",
            "More About Dori: III\t...The Fog Div agreed to listen, and the merchant began to tell her story. It was about herself, from a time when business was not doing so well. Just as she was beginning to feel helpless, she happened to find a magic lamp in her warehouse. She began to polish the lamp, when all of a sudden, a puff of red smoke came out. The smoke spoke to her and claimed to be The Genie of Beauty and Kindness. The merchant somehow reminded the genie of her own lovely daughter, so she kindly offered to grant the merchant a wish.",
            "More About Dori: IV\tWhat could a merchant ever desire more than the prospect of more Mora? So the merchant wished that she could earn more Mora in the future than she could ever hope to count. The Genie of Beauty and Kindness agreed, and became the merchant's supplier, providing her with magical and fantastic goods. The merchant soon went on to make a fortune...",
            "More About Dori: V\tHearing the merchant's story, the Fog Div became very puzzled. The div and the genie were obviously of the same species, so how come the div couldn't perform any magic? The merchant praised the Fog Div's potential, saying that it, too, would surely gain the genie's great power if only it were to stay in the same magic lamp. The Fog Div agreed and entered the merchant's magic lamp... Huh? Is this a real story? Backstory details cost extra! Give me another 990,000 Mora and I'll tell you!",
            "Dori's Hobbies\tHobbies? Sure, I've got tons of hobbies. First there's earning Mora, then there's counting Mora... Oh, and then I like to look at Mora. Ah Mora, nothing in the world makes me happier!",

            "Character Details\t\"Dori Sangemah Bay, owner of the Palace of Alcazarzaray, super-duper merchant who sells everything you need!\"\nWhen one holds Dori's name card, this impressive title instantly comes into view.\nDori is, however, indeed the most special Sumeru merchant of all.\nShe already possesses vast wealth, but is still fervently passionate about earning Mora;\nShe already owns multiple well-renowned merchant caravans, yet she always travels across Sumeru to sell her marvelous items in person.\nSpeaking of which, her wares are just as curious as her style: special travel kit, outdoor dryer machines, automatic snowball launchers... You can probably buy anything you can think of from Dori. The only question is: Do you have enough Mora to do so?",
            "Character Story 1\t\"Oh wow, are you headed for the desert? I have some good stuff you'll need there.\"\n\"The rainforest is terribly infested with poisonous snakes, ferocious monsters, and a terminal case of humidity — it's no place for the less-than-thoroughly prepared, no sir! Now then, why don't you try bringing this for your trip? Buy it now and enjoy a 20 percent discount!\"\n\"Hold your horses, hotshot. You're not taking that route, are you? There's a huge pack of monsters lying in wait ahead that-a-ways. But see, I have some weapons here that you won't regret purchasing — you know, for self defense!\"\n\"Going to the Akhtamun Ruins? You've got the right person. First things first, you'll need a complete set of water-drawing tools... Which, as it happens, I happen to have for sale!\"\nThere is a tale among adventurers in Sumeru.\nIt says that if you are about to embark on a journey into a dangerous place, you'll see a diminutive figure, seemingly having been waiting for you.\nBe it in the treacherous mountains, arid deserts, grim rainforests, or desolate areas inhabited by monsters, you'll always see her smiling face.\nWord has it that Dori carries all manner of marvelous items on her person all the time. Her items can help adventurers get through their pressing troubles.\n—At a \"reasonable\" price, of course.\nAdventurers who \"have just received Dori's help in their time of need\" at the cost of \"paying a large sum of Mora at once\" often develop conflicted feelings toward her — somewhere in between gratitude and a grudge.\nFor Dori's part, she considerately ignores the conflicted look on their faces, putting the fresh Mora in her almost-bursting purse and bidding them adieu with a contented smile.\n\"Thank you for your generous purchase. Hehe.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tFrom the perspective of others, Dori's business has always been on the up and up. However, only Dori herself knows how many unimaginable bottlenecks she's struggled through.\nThere was a time when orders from all over Sumeru just kept flooding in and Dori couldn't deliver such a giant number of orders in a timely fashion.\nUnfortunately, the capacity of the usual merchant routes was too limited for the delivery of commodities in such a gigantic quantity.\nMany members of Dori's merchant caravans suggested rejecting certain orders to dial down the scale of delivery and maintain a decent, stable profit — one that already seemed set to make them immensely wealthy, given time.\nBut Dori took a very bold step: She accepted all the orders while starting cooperation with the Kshahrewar to establish new trade routes in areas that were known to be dangerous.\nShe opened the new routes up to nearby merchant caravans, took the opportunity to found a commerce guild and put the relevant resources to good use, and finally eliminated the bottleneck that her business was stuck in.\nToday, Dori's new, built-from-scratch merchant routes are seen all across Sumeru, and the good reputation of \"Lord Sangemah Bay\" has spread far and wide.\nThe words Dori said to her caravan members have also become common knowledge:\n\"I'm not some stupid toadstool. I don't cancel or reject any orders.\"\n\"Every Mora that can be earned, will be earned by me. Why? Well, because it's there, of course.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tDori used to suffer terribly from insomnia. Back then, she would often lose sleep for no reason. After such sleepless nights, she would show up to trade meetings with a pair of raccoon eyes.\nEven the best doctors couldn't diagnose her properly. She burned one frankincense stick after another, and yet they did not lull her into sleep but into coughing fits instead.\nIt was at that moment that a doctor passed by and told Dori this:\n\"I've heard that some people place an hourglass by their bedside. The sound of the falling sand helps them sleep.\"\nDori tried it for a few days and it didn't work. However, she was inspired by the failed attempt, ordering a large custom-made hourglass.\nThat which was in this hourglass was not sand, but shiny Mora.\nThat night, embraced by the music of jingling Mora, Dori slept soundly at last.\nAfter that, Dori learned the trick to dealing with insomnia:\n\"To sleep well, you must first secure peace of mind.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tMaybe it's because of her deep love for Mora, Dori also takes interest in \"whoever or whatever might bring Mora in.\"\nFor example, her merchant caravans use Sumpter Beasts to carry cargo, so Dori had an \"amusement park\" built for the Sumpter Beasts such that they might enjoy their downtime.\nShe also handpicks Sumpter Beast food of the best quality to make sure that they have balanced nutrition and that they stay in good health.\nAlso, as a shrewd merchant, she never misses a single business opportunity.\nSumpter Beasts playing together in the amusement park make for a fun scene, so Dori took the chance to open the amusement park to tourists and sold tickets, food, and souvenirs to them. The cost of raising the Sumpter Beasts was covered by the amusement park's revenue in no time.\nDori's love for Sumpter Beasts is genuine, and so is her intention to make Mora out of that love.\nPerhaps the Jinni in Dori's lamp knows this better than everyone else. The spirit was tricked into entering Dori's lamp, but it has never left since.\nDori will summon it into combat, but she will also grant its wishes afterwards.\nSometimes the Jinni even thinks that the fairy tale might actually have gotten things reversed —\nFor the one who dwells in the lamp is a powerful fighter, while the one holding the lamp is the one who grants wishes.",
            "Character Story 5\tNo one knows how exactly Dori met Alice, but they are truly a pair of business partners that could make all merchants jealous.\nAlice travels the world, so she does not stay for long every time she visits Sumeru. However, every once in a while, Alice will ask someone to send her new invention to Dori.\nDori, for her part, will sell it and find a way to send the Mora to Alice.\nSometimes, Alice sends the invention with an attached letter that tells Dori to keep the Mora for the time being because Alice is currently in a dangerous area.\nHowever, Dori insists on getting someone to send the Mora to safe zones closest to Alice's position, making sure that Alice will receive the Mora at her earliest convenience.\nThe labor, shipment, insurance... The various costs tend to amount to a fairly large expenditure, but Dori is never stingy in this regard. She even pays in advance.\n\"I, Dori, never default on payment.\"\n\"Also, Ms. Alice has expenses, too. I must make sure that she has Mora at hand whenever she needs it.\"\nDori often repeats these words and, despite the trouble, repeatedly makes sure that Alice's payment is delivered.\nThough Alice is no longer Dori's only supplier, Alice's payment is still a top priority for Dori.\nPerhaps it's because Dori keeps a certain promise embedded in her heart — the promise she made to Alice the day they met.\n\"You want limitless Mora? Sure. I can supply you with marvelous items of all kinds. But how much Mora you're going to make will depend on how good you are at sales.\"\n\"Don't worry. I'll sell them for a good price, earn a large sum of Mora, and deliver your share as quickly as possible... I'll be your greatest business partner.\"",
            "Mora Music Box\tTo better enjoy the fascinating clinking of Mora, Dori ordered a custom-made \"Mora Music Box.\"\nOn top of the music box is a slot precisely the size of a single Mora.\nInsert a Mora through the slot into the box, and it will roll along the intricate tracks inside and make pleasant clinking sounds.\nThese sounds compose beautiful music to which Dori twirls in the grand Palace of Alcazarzaray.\n\"Mora, Mora, shining brightly.\"\n\"Mora, Mora, toward infinity.\"\n\"Beautiful Mora, Dori's Mora.\"\n\"Everyone's Mora, come to Dori.\"\nDori's sung this song countless times, yet she's never tired of it.\nAt the end of her dance, Dori takes a deep bow to her imaginary audience.\nIt is also the moment when the Mora falls to the bottom of the music box, making the final clink —\nWith this finishing touch, an imaginary curtain descends upon Dori's delightful dance.\nHowever, Dori is never quite finished — she always has another Mora to slot into her music box.",
            "Vision\tTwo girls of similar ages hummed a melody that was slightly out of tune. They spent their innocent childhood hand-in-hand as constant companions.\nThey each picked flowers to decorate the other's hair in spring and walked across creeks barefoot in summer.\nThey slid down the golden sand dunes in autumn and shared a book in the warmth of the winter sunlight.\nIt seemed that such happy times would never come to an end.\nThat is, until the elder sister started coughing blood for no reason. At this time, their home came to be ringed by a great many strange adults.\nThe strangers explained the elder sister's situation in serious tones and with unfathomable jargon before sighing at the dingy little room.\nThe younger sister had no idea what was happening, but she visited her sister every day, and her sister would always say this to her with a bright smile:\n\"It's alright. I just need some rest.\"\nSeeing that smile, the innocent younger sister's eyes filled with expectation. She even began looking forward to playing together like they used to.\nBut one day, she saw her sister gripping her chest while telling a story.\nThen, when her frail form collapsed onto the bed, the younger sister reached out to catch her, only to find that her body was so very light.\n...It was almost as if her sister were a feather, a feather that might drift away to some place far, far away.\nLater on, the younger sister found a crumpled note.\nIt was a doctor's prescription, with a list of herbs that were desperately scarce — the collectors who had such herbs were few and far between.\nTo purchase those herbs would cost more than tens of millions of Mora, an impossible price for a family that was already struggling to make the ends meet.\nThe elder sister always shook her head with a smile to dismiss her family's insistence on following the prescription. Perhaps she herself could only find the courage to glance at that note in the deep hours of the night — and dare to dream that she might \"live.\"\nUpon finding out about the note, the younger sister put it into her pocket silently and resolved to save her sister.\n\"I must make a lot of Mora.\"\n\"With enough Mora, my family will never have to smile at me while swallowing their pain, and I will never have to lose anything due to lacking Mora...\"\nPerhaps it was at that moment that the gods looked upon her with mercy.\nBut to an \"ambitious\" person like her, getting a Vision was just the start.\nIn the countless days and nights that have followed, she has constantly kept herself calm and clear-headed, telling herself:\n\"Conviction alone is not enough. I will work hard for what I desire until the end of my days.\"\n\"There's nothing that Lord Sangemah Bay cannot achieve.\""

It can get in the way of other scents when working, you see. But, if you tell me a little bit about your current mood, I can certainly give you a few recommendations.",
            "About Us: Visit\tYou'd like to visit my studio? You're more than welcome to. I can teach you a bit about perfumery, and I have quite a sizable collection for you to peruse. My mother was a perfume enthusiast as well. In fact, many of the perfumes in my collection are gifts from her. If there's time, we could even try them all one by one.",
            "About the Vision\tI once tried to use my Vision to create a plant species that could grow without any nourishment. Unfortunately, my attempts were entirely unsuccessful. It just goes to show, even with the power of a Vision, there's still a limit to what is possible. You can't defy the laws of nature.",
            "Something to Share\tThe five senses aren't completely independent. The color red, for example, might evoke a feeling of warmth, and fragrances can induce specific sensations as well. This property is mainly exploited on the sales front, though. If a customer is feeling down, for example, they can be easily persuaded to choose a perfume with an herbal or sweet scent.",
            "Interesting Things\t{MNothing can be more interesting than encountering new things. You've traveled to so many places, and I'm sure your range of experience is much broader than my own, so I was wondering if I could make a request... Have you ever encountered a flower, or spice maybe, that left a particularly strong impression on you? Could you tell me about it?\nThe \"Inteyvat\" flower... Huh, can't say I've ever heard of it, but that's certainly a grand-sounding name. Alright, well, I've made a note of it. If I'm lucky enough to ever see it in person, I'll certainly let you know.}{FMay I ask you something? The flower you wear in your hair... I've never seen one like it before. If you saw fit to fashion it into a hair accessory, I imagine it means a great deal to you.\nThe \"Inteyvat\" flower... Huh, that's certainly a grand-sounding name. I don't know how you came to possess it, but I'm sure it means you are very important to this world.}",
            "About Chevreuse\tI'm not sure if she ever mentioned it, but we met each other through work. Although, most of our conversations aren't nearly as serious as our jobs would suggest. One time, she told me she read a novel about a perfumer who makes a scent using human tissue. Fictional, of course, but in the story it turns out to be astonishingly successful — the finest perfume ever made. Based on my own experience, I find it hard to believe the scent would turn out quite so wonderful in real life...\nChevreuse wasn't too focused on the feasibility, though. She was too busy trying to unravel all the legal liabilities involved in a situation like that.",
            "About Chiori\tAs a designer, Chiori has a keen eye for trends. Although we deal in completely different products, I still enjoy listening to her talk about the creative thought process behind her designs. Not to mention, she has a pretty good eye when it comes to perfume. Whenever I have her test out my new products, she always manages to pick the one that ends up selling the best.",
            "About Charlotte\tAh, a truly energetic young lady. Being a journalist, I would imagine quite a few people see her as nothing but trouble, but that hasn't been my experience. Even after discovering the true nature of my work, she still chose to keep it to herself. This despite the fact that she had no reason to help me, and it probably wasn't in her professional interests to do so. So, I have quite a high opinion of her. If she ever needed my help, I would certainly not refuse.",
            "About Clorinde\tI'm fairly certain everyone in Fontaine knows that name. She's a formidable Champion Duelist, after all. Although, I find her quite easy to get along with. In my experience, the stronger a person is in combat, the more open they are in conversation.",
            "About Sigewinne\tIf I'm not mistaken, I believe Miss Sigewinne met me when I was very young — too young to remember... Ah, I probably haven't told you, my father works for the Marechaussee Phantom, so we often have Melusines over as guests. Apparently, the Melusines were often the ones looking after me as a baby.\nBut, Miss Sigewinne has never treated me as her junior. She always speaks highly of my perfumes, so whenever I make a new sample, I usually set aside an extra for her.",
            "About Neuvillette\tAs a perfumer, if your sense of smell starts to become dull, there's actually quite an easy solution — drinking fresh water. I'm not usually strict about the water I drink, but, out of curiosity, I once attended a water-tasting event organized by Monsieur Neuvillette.\nHe had such an abstract yet distinctive understanding of the distinguishing features of different types of water. It almost reminded me of the way magazine articles talk about perfume. He took the time to understand my needs, and recommended a few water sources to me with utmost sincerity. He was so considerate, sometimes, I choose to buy the varieties he recommended, even if just out of respect for him.",
            "About Wriothesley\tYou know Wriothesley? Haha, well aren't you full of surprises. From what I know, the Duke tries to keep a very low profile — most people don't even know he exists. Monsieur Neuvillette once tried to recommend my services to him, but apparently he thought that the Fortress of Meropide would have no occasion for them.\nI can't know what his reasons were for turning me down, as I've never met him in person. But if I was to speculate... I would say perhaps there are certain things he doesn't want washed away. Perhaps he prefers to leave them there... as a warning.",
            "About Tighnari\tI've only met him in person a few times, but we communicate by letter often. He reached out to me first, writing a letter after tracking down my details through some roundabout way. He was extremely polite, and it was incredibly flattering to have such a renowned botanist ask for my flower-related expertise. But, I also saw it as a chance to learn from him. I decided to ask some of my own questions, particularly about perfume ingredients from Sumeru, and he gave me thorough answers to each and every one.\nNow, our correspondence is much more casual. He even tells me about his companions sometimes. I really am delighted I got this opportunity to make a new friend.",
            "More About Emilie: I\tPeople often romanticize perfume, assigning it all sorts of poetic qualities. But, in reality, perfume-making is much closer to a science. It can be boiled down to a simple chemistry experiment, really. It's up to the perfumer to bridge the gap between the product's artistic and scientific qualities, and doing that with any degree of success takes quite a bit of skill.",
            "More About Emilie: II\tPeople can describe how a certain scent makes them feel, sure. But, it's very difficult to recreate a scent just based off of a written description, even for me. So, I do apologize, but I don't take custom orders. That said, if you find any of my other perfumes to be to your liking, it would of course be my honor to do business with you.",
            "More About Emilie: III\tA perfume must undergo a series of tests before it's released, including a shelf-life test. This can help answer several questions: How long does the product last? Is it prone to deterioration? Will it become toxic or even dissipate over time?\nHuh, now that I think about it... Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way of doing a shelf-life test for interpersonal relationships?",
            "More About Emilie: IV\tI don't deliberately hide my real profession, but I do prefer to be discreet whenever possible. Not because I'm worried that it'll turn customers off my perfume, I'm just cognizant of the fact that my work as a forensic cleaner subjects me to a lot of sensitive information, things that can't be disclosed to the public. The people who commission my services place a lot of trust in me. I don't want them to receive any unwanted attention because of me.",
            "More About Emilie: V\tPerfume-making has only ever been a hobby for me. Something I do in my spare time, just like how some people learn to play a musical instrument or make crafts.\nStill, my goal in life wasn't always to be a forensic cleaner. My mother works as a forensic pathologist, and ever since I was little, I knew I wanted to work in criminal investigations just like her. For a long time, my talent for chemistry inspired me to pursue trace evidence analysis. But as I progressed further in my studies, I started to encounter real-life crime scenes. I'll never forget one scene I saw... A young child had been murdered, there was blood soaked into the carpet and splattered all over the walls... And after the investigators finished their assessment, they just left. I couldn't imagine what those poor parents were going through... it didn't seem right that they had to clean up after their own child's murder, all by themselves.\nSo, yeah. That's what led me into forensic cleaning.",
            "Emilie's Hobbies\tI like to collect newspaper clippings. Whenever I come across an unbelievable story in the newspaper, I cut out a clipping and add it to my collection. I've filled up several thick binders that way. Flipping through them is almost like reading one of those short story series that Chevreuse is so fond of.",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tThere is much that may be said when discussing a bottle of perfume.\nWe might speak of its fragrance: How it first bewitches with its top notes, before gradually melding with its wearer, and finally taking a subdued bow amidst the lingering aroma.\nWe could speak of the concept underlying its design: Is it meant to enliven the spirit, or to lend an aura of alluring mystique?\nWe might even debate the most appropriate occasion for its use: Would one be willing to attend a social ball clad in this aroma, or would it be better suited to suffusing the atmosphere of a private date?\nEmilie finds these matters to be most worthy of discussion, as they are intimately related to how one selects a perfume. Compared to such considerations, the precise identity of the perfumer who prepared the scent is not a factor that needs to be contemplated when making one's choice.\nAlas, neither customers' views nor popular trends are easily shifted. A herd mentality that craves security often leads people to prefer purchasing from well-known brands or designers, for one rarely goes wrong that way.\nFame, therefore, is a double-edged sword. The more famous one is, the greater the odds of receiving negative feedback, and many are exhausted by treading upon such thin ice.\nBut Emilie, famous though she is within Fontaine's perfume industry, seems untroubled by such.\nHer products are free-form, spontaneous — indeed, she worries not at all about designing perfume, for her true profession lies elsewhere.",
            "Character Story 1\tHaving handed her signed and stamped power of attorney documentation and confidentiality agreement to the Maison Gardiennage officer for perusal, Emile steps over the cordon and onto the scene.\nShe has already been apprised of all case-critical information: the number of deceased, the state of the corpses, and the parameters of the cleanup required. As to other case details, she is neither curious nor inclined to ask further questions.\nThe bodies, as well as severely damaged objects, have already been removed. And so she inspects the area meticulously, making mental notes of things that might be easily missed or difficult-to-clean areas that require extra attention.\nShe has encountered many such crime scenes, and with time, has been able to piece together in broad strokes the sequence of events — through the directions of blood spatter, the traces left by the residue of human tissues, and how objects fell.\nStill, this is not her professional duty. In the most infrequent of circumstances, of course, she will be invited to use this experience to aid the Maison in recreating crime scenes. But this is not one of those special cases. This case is already closed, and as a \"forensic cleaner,\" she needs only draw a line under it.\nAnd so she silently dons her protective clothing and goggles, and gets to work. All goes well. Chemicals dissolve and wash away the rust and dark-brown, even black-colored stains, while sticky tissues and sharp fragments are cleaned separately. The harrowing scene and horrid smells are wiped away, erased like erroneous brushstrokes from a canvas.\nFinally, she invites the Garde, who has been waiting all this time outside, back in. They convey their thanks and bid her farewell, before manually removing the cordon.\nEmilie remains silent as she changes back into her previous outfit. She cannot help but think that though the deceased should already have been buried as those dear to them watched, parts of them have only just now been put to rest.\nShe adjusts her hat, nodding her head slightly toward the clean room, bidding a final farewell to persons completely unknown to her, as if she too were taking some small part in their funerals.",
            "Character Story 2\tAccording to certain psychological theories, creative types are even less concerned with the placement or organization of their belongings than most. Short passages containing such personality analyses are often found in the corners of Fontainian magazines and tabloids, and they even rerun every few days, as if the editors think people cobble their self-understanding together from such fragmentary pieces — not to mention possess deficient memories.\nSuch ideas are clearly stereotypes, for none would claim that Emilie wants for creativity, while her home is perfectly spick and span. To claim that a perfumer so famous lacks imagination, her modestness or otherwise notwithstanding, would be to categorically deny the Fontainian perfuming profession in its totality.\nBut Emilie's home is, if anything, overly clean. Few furnishings stand atop the visible flooring, and most items have been carefully packed into hermetic compartments. Indeed, one can barely tell that anyone lives there. Even friends who occasionally visit, such as Chiori, bluntly ask if this is a manifestation of some kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nEmilie simply laughs, saying: \"It has to be this way, that's all.\"\nHer dwelling is not large, but it has two workshops, one for perfuming, and the other for mixing the chemicals needed for her work. Neither allows for flasks or other items to be placed haphazardly, and so, while she has no love of daily drudgeries or household chores, Emilie has had to slowly learn the strict art of organized stowage and storage, habitually drawing clear lines between the different aspects of her life.\nThis terrifying discipline is something she has mastered with some ease — just as one separates dangerous reagents into separate vials, so too does she create freely in one bottle, while accumulating the experience that crystallizes out of solutions in another.",
            "Character Story 3\tWhen she is free, Emilie often goes to have dinner with her parents at their place.\nHer father is an officer of the Marechaussee Phantom, while her mother works in forensic medicine, and they often invite over human and Melusine colleagues alike as guests. One can only imagine just how many unusual conversations this rather ordinary-looking dining room has hosted.\nOf the many topics discussed, Emilie's trajectory through life is one of the more normal ones.\nWhen children her age were still reading comics, Emilie was reading her mother's work texts. She was fascinated by the mystery of chemical reactions, and began to formally study related disciplines. Such skills should surely prove useful, but just what kind of work should she pursue? Work in a crime lab, perhaps — so her father suggested.\nThough, such work always came with an element of danger, so it was best to learn a little self-defense from him first if she wanted to join — so he quickly added.\nFor a long time afterward, Emilie would work toward this goal.\nBut one day, her parents opened a bottle of red wine before the meal, as they lamented what had happened that day—\nThe Marechaussee Phantom's duties were to pursue the truth, but once that was done, any remaining fallout was left in the hands of the heartbroken bereaved. When some family's child commits suicide, soaking the rug with their blood, and the Gardes sent to investigate merely rule it a suicide and leave... Just how will the parents feel, left to pick up the pieces and clean up what remains of their child?\nAgnostic to purpose and intent, the nature of chemical reactions was the same, just like human emotions.\nPerhaps... Perhaps she could help.\nHaving had the thought, she later put it into action. She named her profession that of a \"forensic cleaner,\" making modifications to the chemicals she originally intended for use in tests, such that they became cleaning agents that could wipe away all that remained on any given scene.\nOf course, though the environment itself might be cleansed anew, the pain could not be so purged. Still, Emilie can share some small part of the burden, that those left behind will not have to shoulder it alone.",
            "Character Story 4\tLife is unfair, and not all have the luxury of enjoying their hobbies. Thus, Emilie truly treasures such opportunities.\nCollecting perfumes was once her mother's hobby, but due to her work, she was able to apply them less than frequently, and so those top-shelf fragrances would eventually become Emilie's treasures. She loved the shiny bottles and the clear fluids within, basking in the mysterious reactions produced by interwoven aromas.\nIt was due to her hobby of perfumery that she later became quite taken with traveling to gather materials.\nShe has scaled snowy mountains few have traversed, and squeezed her way through the packed markets of other lands. Fragrances are shapeless, and are thus easily overlooked, but they are a necessary component of any person's living environment. Most people have somewhat unvaried preferences in this regard, but Emilie accepts all comers. Good, bad, simple, complex, Emilie carefully categorizes them all in her heart, and they form for her a bridge to understanding this world.\nFrom such a perspective, fragrances are no luxury, but rather, a thing that people can naturally enjoy... and thus, perfumes should be no different.\nOf course, this is very much against market trends. It is practically taken as a given that those crystalline, gem-like products should be placed under the searing spotlight and sold at extravagant prices.\nAnd Emilie remains but a hobbyist, and as such, cannot change this state of affairs by herself. Thus, many of her works have never reached the shelves of any shop. As one who works outdoors herself, she has designed insect-repelling, anti-perspiration perfume, though such a notion doesn't even sound remotely romantic. She also developed a fragrance specifically for Melusines to enjoy, but humans seemed unwilling to buy them.\nNot that she was disappointed, of course. That she could get these products into the hands of those who needed them was satisfaction enough.\nOf course, she does have some real regrets. For example, the risk of small animals knocking over or inadvertently ingesting chemicals keeps her from having a psychological support pet, which limits her to playing with other people's puppies in the park.\nNaturally, she also has to avoid wearing perfume when going to meet them. Animals have sensitive noses, after all, and she would very much like to be their friend.",
            "Character Story 5\tPeople often propose rules for groups in an attempt to explain certain phenomena.\nIn her work as a forensic cleaner, Emile encounters large quantities of human tissue, some Fontainian, and others not. Being meticulous in her preparation of the relevant cleaning agents, she gradually discovered that Fontainian human tissue structures seemed to have minuscule differences from those of other nations.\nDiscreetly investigating, she discovered something strange that very, very few had ever noticed. Even those who had some awareness would simply attribute it to Fontaine's special natural environment. After all, people in some places experienced greater hair loss, while people in others had naturally slim fingers... All a matter of their living in the same environment giving rise to those traits.\nEmilie sensed that the truth might not be so simple, but she tentatively accepted that explanation.\nAt least, she did until after the \"prophecy\" had already come to pass and she received some new cleaning commissions. She found that those minute differences between Fontainians and humans from other nations had silently slipped away, like so much water flowing between one's fingers. Indeed, it was like they had never existed.\nAfter giving it much thought, Emilie decided that she would seek the answer for herself.\nShe paid Iudex Neuvillette — who had allegedly once given a full account of the origin of Fontainians at the Opera Epiclese — a visit, and related her doubts to him.\nHe considered this for a moment, before informing her: \"Fontainians are now true humans.\"\n\"Are now,\" he had said. Some change in Fontainians, then, must have indeed occurred in the fulfillment of the prophecy.\nThat was enough for her. She needed no further details, having only desired confirmation. Indeed, she could already perceive that the details constituted a threshold ordinary humans should not trespass, let alone seek to. In her work with the Maison Gardiennage, she had already signed many confidentiality agreements, both great and small, but no document was needed to tell that silence was the best course here.\nPerhaps this was even, in truth, no big deal. Her life had not changed, and in fact, things were simpler now that her concoctions needed to make no distinction based on national differences.\nAnd so, she would keep this secret in the same place where she held all those joys and sorrows, reunions and partings — locked deep in her heart.",
            "\"Constructed From Real Events\"\tChevreuse, Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, once gave this assessment of Emilie: not a romantic person.\nEmilie has responded to these stereotypical expectations people have of perfumers with a serious explanation: Once a perfume is out on the market, the right to analyze it passes from the perfumer to the purchaser. She herself might detect a whiff of her childhood in the scent of Marcotte, but others might sense love, invigoration, and perhaps even regret. A person responds to things based on their experiences, and in such matters, one cannot generalize. If the perfumer does not take the fragrance development process seriously, but instead pursues the romantic color of some specific place and emotion, they will likely wind up with an undesirable result.\n\"And is that why you keep newspaper clippings? To collect the experiences of people?\" Chevreuse asked.\n\"Sort of,\" Emilie thought to herself. She had not taken those clippings specially for that purpose, of course. It was just part of her reading habits, being more interested as she was in real-life happenings than in the constructed narratives of novels.\nOf those various excerpts, the vast majority were serious reporting, while another small part could be compiled into a list of \"The Decade's Top Ten Incredulous Situations.\" These hilarious newspieces were fuel for casual conversation between Emilie and her friends.\nAs for Chevreuse, she preferred novels.\nBy this logic, it seemed that of the two of them, the Special Patrol Captain was the romantic. But though Chevreuse's great love was crime fiction, she was quite perplexed by the emotional entanglements of the characters therein, instead enjoying expounding at length upon how responsibility should be apportioned among the various parties.\nSo, not the most romantic, either.\nAnd so, while their interests might differ, how they think actually has some similarities — a fact that goes some way to explaining why they became friends.",
            "Vision\tEmilie often receives cleanup commissions after cases have been concluded, and by the time she arrives, none are left at the scene but an officially posted guard keeping watch, allowing her to conduct her work in peace.\nBut sometimes, the scene is not so silent.\nEmelie reached the scene of the incident to see the dazed kin of the victim pacing around the perimeter of the cordon. It was a young lady, her eyes dead husks, knowing not where to go or what to do — only that she couldn't bear to leave. This, in truth, was no obstacle to Emilie's work. She could have simply shown her papers, accessed the site, and completed her cleanup. That was all her duty demanded — it was just her job, business as usual.\nStill, she hesitated. Greeting the Garde on duty, she walked toward the lost soul.\nOver the next few hours, Emilie sat by the woman's side in silence as the latter slowly told her stories of herself and the deceased. Emilie did not reply all that much. She merely held the woman's hand, patiently waiting as the tale stumbled forth, waiting until all the anxious thoughts and troubled words had been exhausted, until only quiet sorrow remained.\nThat pain was unavoidable. This was all she could do.\nThe delay caused her to finish her work very late, and as she stowed her tools and chemicals away, the last light still peeking through the window was already quite dim — all the better to highlight that glimmering Vision.\nFrom that day on, she would never again put any time limit on her work, always leaving ample time to spare. If any there should need a listening ear, there she would be to hear them."

            "More About Eula: II\tPeople tell me that if I just spoke more softly, or was more polite, or acted more deferentially, others may find it easier to forgive me, but the only reason they think that way is because they've never been branded a pariah before. There is no easy path to redemption when you're a social pariah. I'm more inclined to stop tiptoeing around everyone all the time and just get out there and make them respect me the old-fashioned way! As in, we square off and if they win, I humbly accept my punishment, but if they lose, they must acquiesce to my demands... Such as... Well, I mean, if I want to buy a loaf of bread, take my darn money, for crying out loud!",
            "More About Eula: III\tThe Knights of Favonius are actually fairly reasonable, at the very least they reward merit and not social status.

            "More About Eula: IV\tThe name Lawrence only became a social stigma after the clan fell from grace. It was once an honor to be called a Lawrence, but unfortunately, most people have forgotten about that part of history.

I'm quite satisfied with that appraisal.",
            "More About Eula: V\tIf my family members refuse to change their corrupt ways, or worse, continue to cause active harm in Mondstadt...

            "Character Details\tEula's role within the Knights of Favonius is Captain of the Reconnaisance Company.\nThe nature of her work means that she rarely sets foot in the city — she spends most of her time out in the wild, leading her team of scouts as they hunt down Abyss Order operatives and other monsters.\nKnown as the Spindrift Knight, Eula wields her blade with consummate skill, but perhaps more importantly, she is well-versed in strategy and possesses great courage and excellent intuition. Grand Master Varka had nothing but the highest praise for her, even declaring once that she was the Dandelion Knight's equal on the battlefield.\nOn the face of it, to have two such outstanding knights attending to the defense of Mondstadt in a single generation should be a cause for nothing but celebration. But dig a little deeper and there is a fundamental difference between Jean and Eula.\nFor Eula is a descendant of the once-aristocratic Lawrence Clan. The blood that flows through her veins once flowed through those of Mondstadt's oppressors during one of the darkest periods of the city's history.\nConsequently, Eula has been viewed with contempt by the citizens of Mondstadt since birth. The Lawrence name stands for a legacy of depravity and despotism that stains Mondstadt's past and scars the minds of its citizens even to this day.\nSo, whenever Eula appears, old wounds resurface. People despise the aristocracy, and this does no favors for her reputation.\nHowever, Eula is strong-willed and in spite of everything, she joined the Knights of Favonius and rose to the rank of Captain.\nWhen people in the city voiced their reservations, she would respond head-on, claiming that her chosen course of action was out of a desire for \"vengeance.\" This matter-of-fact confession would alarm them all the more and has convinced everyone that she joined the Knights of Favonius only to serve as a mole for the former aristocracy.\nOne person who sees things differently is Acting Grand Master Jean. In fact, she speaks rather fondly of Eula.\n\"The rumors are all groundless. The Spindrift Knight is simply misunderstood, that's all.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tOn the one hand, she is a descendant of the disgraced Lawrence Clan, the scion of a corrupt aristocracy. On the other, she is one of the top two sword fighters in Mondstadt.\nIn other words, Eula is equal parts tainted blood and superior swordsmanship.\nThere is no knowing when she might strike, nor what she might take from you... In the eyes of the citizens of Mondstadt, the Reconnaissance Captain is as unpredictable and tumultuous as the waves on a stormy sea.\nEula responds with a cold haughtiness to accusations of this nature. To any who dare insinuate such things to her face, she replies, \"How dare you. Hmph, I will remember this.\"\nShe is consumed by the desire to avenge herself, but is often on the move far away from the city. Sometimes upon her return to Mondstadt, she will brandish her greatsword and march straight to the Knights of Favonius headquarters.\nOn one occasion, two fresh recruits standing guard on their first day on patrol watched just such a scene play out before their eyes. Alarmed and unsure how to respond, they ultimately did not dare to intervene. Instead, they simply watched on helplessly while Eula made a beeline for Master Jean's office.\nMuch to their surprise, however, hours passed and no sound of a struggle was heard from within.\nStill worried, the guards raised their concerns to Cavalry Captain Kaeya and Librarian Lisa as they were passing by.\n\"The Reconnaissance Captain is back again? When you saw her, was she marching towards Jean's office with her sword in hand, looking like she wanted to settle a score?\"\n\"Goodness, I must head there straight away. How can they have a tea break without me?\"\nLisa hurried to Jean's office the moment she finished speaking. Meanwhile, Kaeya took the two guards outside and explained to them whilst trying to suppress a fit of the giggles:\n\"We all know that the Acting Grand Master is a good judge of character, don't we? The Knights of Favonius are interested in a person's ability, not their family history. That's why she gives up her time to spar with the Reconnaissance Captain. In doing so, she can preserve the dignity of the Knights of Favonius while also providing a way of settling old grievances. Quite brilliant, don't you think?\"\n\"Ohh... S—So that's how it is...\" \"...So 'tea break' is code for 'sparring'...?\"\nThis kind of thing occurs almost on a monthly basis. But... if they're engaged in some sort of strange sparring ritual in there for the sake of settling old grievances and honing their fighting skills... How come they don't make a ton of noise?",
            "Character Story 2\tIn truth, Eula is nothing like the fearsome predator many imagine her to be. On the contrary, constantly being met with prejudice at every turn means she is often the victim.\nAt one time, shops would refuse to sell her their goods, restaurants would put no care and attention into her orders, and the citizens on her patrol route would refuse to cooperate with her. So, Eula's work is fraught with difficulties.\nWhen conflict arises, Eula fights back with a sternly worded threat to indicate that she will remember this grievance and make the offending party pay for it one day. It seems to work like a magic spell, because as soon as these words are uttered, the conflict ceases immediately without ever having to escalate to the level of an all-out confrontation.\nFunnily enough, although people always have their guard up around Eula, she is a law-abiding citizen and has never harmed another Mondstadter in her life. She may come across as having a somewhat frosty demeanor, but she is entirely scrupulous in her speech and conduct.\nNo one can ever find fault with her actions, and as people gradually get to know her, their morbid fear of her will dissipate. They will also start to realize her threats of vengeance are nothing more than a figure of speech that simply serve as a verbal warning in the moment.\nEula, who may or may not be working to bring down the Knights of Favonius from the inside... Eula, who may or may not be an aristocrat mole... New recruits in the Knights of Favonius find her the most difficult person to deal with.\nWhen Jean sends a new recruit to track down Eula in the wilds and deliver a new set of verbal orders, they always receive the same response: \"If you have to resort to tasking the descendant of your former oppressors with doing your work, then perhaps you are not as strong as I thought.\"\nBut despite the antagonism in her words, she will complete her newly assigned tasks to perfection. The new recruit is invariably forced to admit that with her abilities, it is no wonder she was able to achieve a captaincy within just a few years of joining the Knights.\nEveryone knows Eula as the frosty and antagonistic Spindrift Knight, the aristocrat who has a score to settle with the Knights of Favonius, an openly hostile and potentially dangerous individual... but is this really the truth of who she is?\nOn the way back, the new recruit thinks back over Eula's every action.\n\"What was that kind and resilient look I saw in her eyes when she wasn't looking at me? She seems to take her work seriously... So, surely she can be relied on after all?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tMondstadt is a city of freedom and happiness where even the descendants of a disgraced former ruling class can find true friends.\nFortunately, there is one person whom Eula can rely on to be her spokesperson to the Mondstadt masses, and that person is Outrider Amber.\nEverybody loves Amber, so when she is around, shopkeepers will sell their wares to Eula at the normal price. If they're in an especially good mood, they may even exchange a few words with her during the process. It is at moments like this that Eula shows her most agreeable side.\nBecause of this, and because Amber is just so nice, she'll often accompany Eula on trips out, or even run all her errands for her and deliver the goods straight to her home.\nAmber is also the reason that the city folk end up hearing all about the Reconnaissance Captain's accomplishments out in the field. Each time Amber informs them of Eula's long list of achievements in battle, they can't help but let out a little gasp of surprise.\nEarly one weekend morning, Amber stood atop a makeshift stage of wooden crates and began announcing Eula's latest highlights: \"Recently, the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Captain saved the life of a woman at Dornman Port. After further investigation with this woman's close cooperation, she then proceeded to successfully capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port. The woman in question was a renowned legal expert from Liyue, and the Knights of Favonius have since received official correspondence from the Liyue Communications Office thanking the Reconnaissance Captain for her deeds...\"\nWhether because Amber's persistent efforts have overcome historical prejudices or because Eula's achievements as a knight have quelled the long-standing fear in people's hearts, Eula's life has changed noticeably in recent years. Most of the city folk are no longer openly hostile towards her, and she has won over the members of the Knights of Favonius with her consistent results in the field.\nAs for the members of the Reconnaissance Company under her leadership, they support her unconditionally. They always have her back when they head out to Mondstadt's outskirts to defend the peace of their nation.\nOf course, the person who has always tirelessly rooted for Eula, and who is now the most delighted to see people's attitudes towards her change, is Amber. They had been friends for a long time before Eula ever joined the Knights of Favonius, and as the beloved mentee of Amber's grandfather, the first Outrider, Eula has her complete trust.",
            "Character Story 4\tOne might not expect this from her frosty attitude and sharp tongue, but Eula is a talented chef.\nThe Reconnaissance Company today prides itself on having the best field rations in the Knights of Favonius. One staple of their inventory is a moon-shaped pie. Though a field ration, this wonderfully delicious and highly portable food is loved by all who try it.\nThe Reconnaissance Company's designated chef once admitted that when developing this item, she was inspired by the captain's own baked goods. She extended the baking time to make the crust tougher and also substituted a few highly perishable ingredients with ones that last longer, reducing the cost while significantly prolonging the shelf life.\nEven after such a major change to the recipe, the pie still tasted delicious. So, whenever the scouts are snacking, they can't help but wonder: If this is the field ration version, how delicious must the captain's original recipe taste?\nThe answer to this question is buried deep within the pages of a dusty old book in the library. The Lawrence Clan may have been overthrown a long time ago, but they have never given up hope of one day rising again and reclaiming their place as the ruling class. So that they are always prepared for this monumental moment, their offspring are subjected to an educational regime so unbelievably harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.\n\"Noble obligations\" must be performed to absolute perfection in every possible sense, and these obligations cover etiquette, ritual, and study as well as cooking and other domestic chores.\nIn the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, \"Post-liberation Mondstadt lacks etiquette and taste. When the day comes for our clan to seize power once more, there shall be none who are qualified to be our servants. We must be cautious. We must never stoop to the level of the commoners and set foot in the quagmire of vulgarity.\"\nThe Lawrence Clan's culinary arts teacher was particularly strict. If your dough was missing a half-spoonful of flour, or if your condiment was a few grains of salt short, or if you were two seconds late removing something from the oven, you were likely to be both scolded and disciplined. As far as Eula is concerned, the haute cuisine revered by the aristocrats is just another worthless consequence of people dogmatically following outdated rules.\nFor this reason, the only kind of person who Eula will permit to try her own home baking is someone who she... respects...? No, that would be taking it too far. Rather, it should be someone who she grudgingly accepts \"will keep following me around and bothering me, seemingly undeterred by my warnings, despite having crossed me many times to date.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tBesides traditional etiquette, art is the second most highly prized asset to the aristocrats, known as the \"second soul.\"\nThe \"Dance of Sacrifice\" — a ritual used by illustrious families to display their nobility — is thought of as the crystallized form of this soul, the prize gem in the ruler's scepter.\nFolklore holds that Mondstadt's most illustrious clans jointly created the Dance of Sacrifice long before the aristocracy's reign of bloodshed began.\nThe third act, which represents the Lawrence Clan, is a solo dance known as \"Flickering Candlelight.\" The most important part of the Dance of Sacrifice, it was performed by the most senior dancer, who was typically the eldest daughter of the clan.\nThe Lawrence Clan would summon top dancers to serve as tutors for the eldest daughter and ensure it was performed to perfection. Bleeding toes were seen as a point of pride and a rite of passage for every dancer.\nThis ancient ceremony was a continuous tradition for so long that even today, long after being expelled by the people of Mondstadt, the Lawrence Clan still honors it.\nHowever, without the grand banquet and the gorgeous stage that once featured prominently in ceremonial performances, the Dance of Sacrifice is now far from the grandiose affair it once was. Furthermore, the stringent requirements regarding the dancer's posture and movements have also been relaxed due to the lack of tutors. In the end, the Lawrence Clan reluctantly decided that it could no longer be a mandatory part of the curriculum, and they relegated it to an artistic pastime.\nOver time, the negative connotations and elitist expectations associated with this dance have faded away, and today it survives simply as a graceful dance.\nAs the eldest daughter of the present-day Lawrence Clan, Eula found it to be a relaxing pastime in her youth and a welcome respite from her other grueling courses of study.\nToday, Eula appears to have put her artistic pursuits behind her. At least, no one pictures dancing when they think of the Spindrift Knight.\nNevertheless, a distinctly dance-like aesthetic can be observed in Eula's bladework, along with an elegant rhythm and musicality that are difficult to capture in words.\nAs her greatsword rises and falls and sways to and fro, her distinctive and graceful poise is like that of a dancer under the moonlight: faraway, immaculate, and sublime.",
            "Glaciers and Waves\tEula is the bearer of the Lawrence family crest, the \"Glacial Seal.\" It is the highest martial symbol of the clan and represents the spirit of the Lawrence Clan in the early days of Mondstadt before their fall from grace: cold and unsullied, undaunted by any flame, composed and unshaken in all circumstances.\nFew among their number have passed the clan's trials in a thousand years, and the hopes of the clan are passed down from one seal-bearer to the next.\nEula was still quite young when she underwent the trial but she passed with ease, taking up the seal in the process. Then she departed with that badge of honor in her possession and has barely contacted the clan since.\nHer icy sword is a manifestation of the strength represented by the seal, striking with the cold, brutal force of a relentless blizzard and driving her foes into retreat.\nYet, sharp and bright as ice as she is, she has the title of \"Spindrift Knight,\" a name that leads many who hear it to assume that she manipulates Hydro instead of Cryo.\nThere is a story behind that misunderstanding — the story of a habit.\nEula carries an exquisitely crafted bone whistle with her at all times. Each time she blows it, the vivid sound of ocean waves rings out loud and clear, far and wide.\nSince the area her company is in charge of borders the sea, reproducing the sound of waves can be an excellent means of disturbing the enemy's judgment, or of deceiving less intelligent monsters into believing that a tsunami is inbound, causing them to flee in panic.\nUsing this unique combat tactic has helped Eula emerge victorious against larger forces than her own on numerous occasions, and has also earned her the moniker of \"Spindrift Knight.\"\nOf course, a bone whistle is capable of imitating many other sounds, and Eula has her reasons for imitating the ocean waves.\nIt would seem that something akin to the \"Glacier Knight\" should suit her better.\nBut perhaps Eula herself prefers the rolling waves to the cold and unyielding ice...\nRoaming freely across the world, gentle but firm with the reefs and sands in their dominion...\nYes, she yearns not to be sharp and rigid like ice, but to be free and unbound like the ocean spray.",
            "Vision\tWhere do \"grievances\" come from?\nDire straits in the present? Or the misfortunes of the past?\nAnd what does \"vengeance\" mean?\nTo right wrongs and rebalance the scales of justice in one's favor? Or to drive one's foes into a pit of agony?\n\"Restore the clan's former glory, win the respect of the common folk, stand once more at the apex of rulership\"... These things were utterly unimportant to Eula.\nShe had never experienced the great humiliation of her clan — and all the torment she had endured in life had been at their own hands. She attempted to free herself from their shackles, yet struggled to obtain recognition from the outside world.\nHer talk of grievances and vengeance was but a habit, a signal, a shield.\nFor someone in her unique circumstances and position, what remarks should she just laugh off, and what ideas should she hold onto?\nHow should she fight this battle to break free, once and for all, from the great burden of her bloodline?\nIt was with all these questions and more circling around in her mind that Eula came under the tutelage of a long-forgotten old outrider. From him, she learned an open-mindedness and down-to-earth persistence that she had never previously encountered.\nBefore grappling with grievances and vengeance, before questions of clan and outsider, she first had to discover herself.\nHer survival mechanism... her means of self-preservation... her grit and determination...\nShe may articulate it in terms of \"grievances\" and \"vengeance,\" but nothing can change what it is at its core: something both strong and kind.\nEula finally found herself on a gentle path of revenge that was hers alone... and the moment she set foot on that path, there it appeared before her — her Vision."

            "Character Details\tIf you were to open any Kshahrewar textbook, you will find Faruzan's record penned proudly upon the author page.\n\"Faruzan, outstanding researcher of the Akademiya, winner of the Sumeru Puzzlers' League Lifetime Achievement Award, one of the seminal scholars of Ancient Mechanics.\"\nBut if you were to talk to Haravatat students about their choices, they frown as they speak of Faruzan's current state.\n\"Oh, you mean her... Well, her research is... obsolete, and there's no way it'll pass review, so you might as well find another mentor.\"\nSuch reviews, as disparate as heaven and earth, arouse one's curiosity as a matter of course.\nAnd when asked by her juniors, Madam Faruzan often wears an inscrutable look.\n\"Hmm? You mean to ask what happened these past hundred years? And how things came to this pass? Ah, but this is a secret most great. Come closer, and I shall tell you. Yes, yes, closer...\"\n—And then she gives them a good conk on the head.\n\"First! That curiosity of yours is best served in your studies. And secondly! You shall remember to call me 'Madam'!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tFor many researchers at the Akademiya, Faruzan, who has been one of their number since a century prior, has always been a legendary figure.\nIn her brief academic career, she was able to analyze over half the ruins within Sumeru's borders, thereby greatly lowering the difficulty of various further analyses into them and their machinery.\nThe manuscripts and theses she left behind have laid firm foundations for all researchers who would come after, lighting the way for the countless Kshahrewar researchers' pursuit of knowledge.\nHer \"end\" would also add several layers of mystique to her legendary life, for she would disappear under mysterious circumstances while exploring some ruins, and would never be heard from again.\nEach retelling of her tale would grow ever more mysterious with regard to her disappearance.\nSome claim that she came into contact with King Deshret's ancient knowledge and was secretly imprisoned within the Temple of Silence.\nOthers said that her intellect that had been acknowledged by the gods, and that she had been brought up to the heavens to dwell with them.\nAfter all, people generally believed that a legendary figure should have an equally legendary end.\nThus did the tale drift further and further from the truth.\n\"So I made a miscalculation while solving a puzzle, and got trapped in the ruins. What? Is there a rule that says that senior researchers aren't allowed to mess up?\"",
            "Character Story 2\tWhat may come as a surprise to many younger researchers is that though Faruzan has made great contributions to the study of mechanics, she is in fact a member of Haravatat, which specializes in the study of languages.\nSimply put, her field of study is \"the analysis of the structure of and solutions to various ruin devices via the study of stone carvings and other ancient texts.\"\nA century ago, the Akademiya's studies into Ancient Mechanics were not yet mature. As such, Faruzan's ability to prejudge the operations of such machines was indeed of great benefit to the act of exploring ruins.\nHowever, as the number of as-yet-unexplored ruins grew fewer and fewer, and the Kshahrewar's understanding of mechanics grew more advanced, this field of research would slowly lose the luster of yesteryear.\nBy the time Faruzan re-entered the Akademiya a century later, no student in Haravatat could even understand her essays, and the mentors could only look at each other in dismay at the topics she would submit for study.\nOn the other hand, there are many students in Kshahwerar who, having graduated on the back of manuscripts she had written and hearing of her present plight, have come to persuade her to join their Darshan instead, only to see little success in that matter.\nA certain researcher even went a bridge too far in their persuasion, making such claims as \"in the future, Kshahrewar will be the only Darshan that can do research into machines!\" and \"the era of interpreting ancient texts is over!\" This person wound up being chastised by an irate Faruzan for as long as it would take to sit through two entire classes.\nThey say that that evening, this poor researcher would be nursing some alcohol in Lambad's Tavern, aghast and humbled in equal measure.\nA friend of his from Haravatat spent the whole night consoling him, while plotting in his heart to debate this old fogey and show her what for.\nAlas, Lambad's Tavern would have a new inconsolable drunk the very next day.",
            "Character Story 3\tApart from having her topics rejected during review, Faruzan's other major headache is finding a student after her own heart.\nEach time she plans a lecture at Haravatat, the students in the audience either scratch their heads or struggle not to fall asleep as they are subjected to a veritable barrage of mechanics jargon.\nIn a fury, Faruzan will hurl her pointer and begin lambasting her old colleagues in Haravatat for failing in their duties as teachers and training such a generation of juniors.\nHer fury only grows when she realizes that the students pay more attention to her criticisms of folk from the previous century than her explanations of the principles of mechanics.\nAnd when students who have a mind to study mechanics hear that Madam Faruzan would like them to join her, they often express gratitude initially, only to waffle and claim that they must reconsider when they realize, conflict clear on their faces, that it is Haravatat to which they must go.\nOf course, Faruzan never hears these \"considerations\" — the next time they meet, that student will have already joined Kshahrewar.\nBut there was once, when Faruzan had accepted Tighnari's invitation to investigate some rainforest ruins, when she happened upon the humblest of prayers as she walked: \"Oh, great Dendro Archon, please help me learn words faster!\"\nThose words were spoken sadly yet earnestly, and even Faruzan was moved: To think that Sumeru still played host to people with such a passion for the written word!\nThat voice did not seem to belong to a child who had yet to read or write, nor did it sound like a researcher of Satyavada Life. And yet this must have been a person of some skill, for normal folk would not be able to delve this deep into the forest alone. Perhaps this person might even have some experience in dealing with machines in the forest.\nFollowing a brief moment of consideration, Faruzan concluded that this was a student of suitable age, fitting direction, and excellent quality — someone worth taking on as a disciple for sure. So decided, she revealed her presence from behind a tree.\nHaving thought that there was no one about, Collei squeaked in surprise, the sound echoing through the woods.\nTighnari was quick to the rescue, however, and following a stammering explanation from Collei (supplemented with interjections from Tighnari), this most major of misunderstandings was cleared up.\nWith time, Faruzan would reacquaint herself with this young trainee Forest Ranger and get to know her better, even bringing her delicious food every time she visits Gandharva Ville.\nHowever, Collei has realized, to her consternation, that the resolution of the misunderstanding has only made Madam Faruzan... more eager to take her on as a student.\nSurely there must be lots of Akademiya students who \"respect their teachers and their teachings\" and \"devote themselves to diligence,\" no?\nPerhaps even Faruzan has not realized that there is one other thing about Collei that has attracted her attention:\nThat despite having experienced inhuman suffering, she has nonetheless been able to gain the strength to face life.",
            "Character Story 4\tEven Faruzan herself cannot speak very articulately about the century in which she was trapped within the ruins, for her memories of it are very foggy.\nThe ruins' origin? Unknown. Its location? Unknown. All she remembers is that it was related to King Deshret's civilization and filled from wall to wall with mechanisms and secret inscriptions.\nThe mysterious power within the ruins had kept her body in a state of stasis, knowing neither hunger nor physical fatigue, yet not wholly able to shake off mental wear.\nShe expended all the writing material she had on hand, yet could not translate a single line of text; used up a lifetime's worth of knowledge, yet could not unlock a single device.\nLying amidst a mountain of manuscript paper, she stared blankly at the cipher-text on the ceiling.\nThey mocked her, these legacies of an ancient deity — scorned her ignorance and the pettiness of the modern person.\nDid all she had studied and prided herself upon, did the painstaking research done by generations of scholars truly matter so little in the face of this ancient civilization?\nFaruzan got up from the ground, picked up a piece of smashed stone, and continued carving upon the tiles.\nAs long as there was life, there was hope. What was unknown today could be learned tomorrow. Civilizations that existed could continue to evolve. Solutions unreached by the people of today would be uncovered by those who would come after.\nEven if this was to be her grave, she would leave some deductions and trial-and-error records behind to grant the next unfortunate, trapped soul some chance of escape.\nThis was the spirit of scholarship — this was why researchers existed in the first place.\nAfter who knows how long, the entire floor, as far as she could touch it, had been filled with the symbols of obscure deductions.\nAfter that indeterminate time, her memories began to grow fuzzy and her consciousness faded, and she began to mutter words none could comprehend.\nAnd at one point — she knew not when — she finally found a way to solve the enigma.\nIn her addled state, she did not yet realize that the true struggle still awaited her, beyond the walls of those ruins.",
            "Character Story 5\tFaruzan would have to recuperate for quite some time after her escape to regain consciousness.\nSeeing Sumeru vastly changed from what she remembered, Faruzan almost believed that she was still within the ruins, trapped in some kind of illusion-generated device.\nIt was not until someone from the Akademiya came to confirm her identity using past records within Akasha and explained the changes the world had undergone during this time that Faruzan began to slowly accept that time had indeed passed.\nThat researcher brought her a Kshahrewar book, and as she cracked it open, she found this written on the title page:\n\"Much of the content in this book came from Madam Faruzan's treatises and manuscripts. We hope that her name will still be remembered by future generations of students when she returns.\"\nAs Faruzan read this text, organized by old friends of hers, she felt as if she could almost see her classmates again, talking and chatting about their futures. Yet this was already something from a century ago.\nThe people she knew, the people who knew her... they were all no longer here.\nShe had returned to Sumeru indeed, but it was as if she had drifted to some strange land instead.\nEven wayfarers adrift may return to their home, but she had been left unmoored on time's ocean, and there was no returning to the past.\nThe poor researcher at her side was trying to pick and choose their words such that they might inquire as to what had happened to this senior from times past without touching any sore spots.\nFaruzan closed her book in silence before speaking of those past events in an even tone.\n\"—It was just a failed experiment. Such things happen to us researchers, don't they?\"\nNo matter the location, situation, or generation, time would never stop for Faruzan again.",
            "Vairambhaka Gear\tThis multi-purpose ruin exploration auxiliary support terminal, code-named \"Vairambhaka,\" is one of the few projects that Faruzan was able to successfully secure funding for from the Akademiya following her return.\nThis device can perform escort, monster dispersal, sand-clearing, and various other tasks. As per her usual preferences, it also contains various components that can be pressed interactively to relieve boredom.\nUnexpectedly, this travel essential actually wound up attracting the attention of a group of matra. They barged into her workshop without explanation and began to look the Vairambhaka up and down.\nUpon discovering its many seemingly useless components, their suspicions were aroused further, and ignoring Faruzan's protests that they \"were just for stress relief,\" they planned on taking her latest work apart to examine it carefully.\nFortunately, the General Mahamatra, Cyno, arrived in time to stop them.\nAs it turned out, they suspected that Faruzan had been reticent about her mysterious disappearance on account of some nefarious secret.\nThey also believed that she had refused to join Kshahrewar so that she could use Haravatat's lack of expertise in mechanics to build something dangerous.\nAfter all, few are the researchers who have not been seduced by the ominous knowledge that King Deshret's civilization had gained access to. As such, they came flocking the moment they heard that Faruzan was making some machine, as if to fight some terrible foe.\nCyno, armed with records related with Faruzan, was able to dispel their doubts one by one, before apologizing to Faruzan for his subordinates' trespass, leaving one of them to help clear up the mess.\nFaruzan, who was just suffering from a lack of manpower right at that moment, was quite satisfied indeed with that arrangement. Quite liking this General Mahamatra's style, she invited Cyno to give this new machine a name.\nCyno thought for a moment before saying that since it could stir up strong winds and had a connection with the matra, she could call it the \"Great Vayuvyastra.\"\nFaruzan's puzzlement at that could easily rival that which she had shown in the ruins belonging to King Deshret.\nFortunately, one of the matra came to her rescue, mentioning that Kshahrewar already possessed a machine with the same name, thus saving them all what would come if she were to inquire about the \"deeper meaning\" behind such a name.\nLater, having done her own independent study into how that name was formed, Faruzan would come up with her own name for her newest work — and thus, the Vairambhaka Gear was born.",
            "Vision\tAlthough she has forgotten how she solved that puzzle, Faruzan does have some vague impression about what happened to her as she left the ruins.\nThe first thing she felt was light, stinging her eyes till they shut and causing her to stagger back a little.\nIt was then followed by wind, whipping about her face and flowing across her shoulders like a searing, welcoming kiss.\nHer eyes were closed, and yet she felt that she could see everything, and following the wind she took one step, and then another, toward newfound freedom after a century of being lost.\nSuch a long period of time would have changed the environment and eroded her memory, and she might have failed to find the way home.\nYet she followed the wind's guidance even in her semi-conscious state, and it led her swaying through the wilds, avoiding monsters and hazardous areas alike, until she was assaulted by a familiar yet foreign sensation.\nAs she collapsed, her stomach began to grumble.\n\"Ah... Is that hunger? It's been a while, hasn't it...\"\nShe had solved the machine, escaped the ruins, but at the end, she had forgotten the most primal of needs!\nThe wind died down, and unable to continue on, Faruzan collapsed, falling into a deep sleep.\"\n...\nA sudden wind whipped about a merchant caravan traversing the lands at a leisurely pace, getting into one Sumpter Beast's eyes, causing it to turn away and stop advancing.\nThe merchant was about to pull it back into line, only to notice something glittering in the distance.\n\"Hey, keep up with the group! What are you looking at, anyway? Treasure?\"\n\"No, wait... That looks like a person over there, lying on the ground!\"\nAnd in the distance, a Vision shone brightly at the side of an unconscious Faruzan."

            "Character Details\tFischl is the Prinzessin der Verurteilung who arrived here after being exiled from the otherworld, \"Immernachtreich.\"\nShe \"observes and weaves the threads of fate\" together with her talking night raven familiar, Oz.\nOwing to reasons she cannot and Oz will not explain, Fischl now serves the Adventurers' Guild as an investigator.",
            "Character Story 1\tAs an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild, the single biggest advantage Fischl has over her peers is Oz.\n\"Milady, please stop sending me out to spy on Stormterror. That chap could eat me for breakfast! Well, I'm so puny I probably wouldn't even get caught between his teeth, but... Anyway, I don't want to die!\"\n\"Hmph! You are supposed to be my familiar. Not everyone gets to be the Prinzessin der Verurteilung's familiar, do you understand? Consider it your honor to dedicate your life to serving me!\"\nFischl is able to see through Oz's eyes. Whenever she wants to, she possesses Oz and looks down upon the earth from the sky.\nWhether she wants to inspect the flora on the Stormbearer Mountains or observe a disturbance in Wolvendom, through Oz she can see anything and everything.\nThanks largely to her unique ability — and, to a lesser extent, to her own effort and peculiar personality — Fischl quickly went from the rookie investigator of the Adventurers' Guild to a respected rising star of the organization.\nShe's certainly done well for herself. She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the guild master.\nThen again, would they really have had to do much persuading? If she's the Prinzessin der Verurteilung... one can only assume that would make them the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung.",
            "Character Story 2\tIt's said that there is currently a \"Fischl Dictionary\" in circulation among the adventurers.\nNamely, a book that aims to translate Fischl's peculiar way of speaking into something more understandable.\nFor example:\n\"I hear... echoing in the abyss of time, the burning winds of the old, all of which shape the spire forgotten in the torrents of karma\" would translate into \"Stormterror's Lair\";\n\"Servants of the Verurteilung name! As you have requested, prepare to receive the great wisdom of the prinzessin\" would be \"I'll look into that and let you know ASAP\";\n\"Rejoice! O, ye servants who long for the blessing of the prinzessin; venture now deep into the battlefield with hearts of the tiger\" means that the initial investigative work has been completed;\n\"All has been written in this tome of dark prophecies\" simply means that her journal has been updated with the latest reports.\nHowever, the \"Fischl Dictionary\" is actually just an in-joke, not a real book.\nThose who are familiar with Fischl concentrate on what she means to say, not the way in which she says it; she notices this and takes it as a sign of true respect.\n\"Aha! So you do understand. Then fate does indeed bring kindred spirits together.\"\nThose who manage to adopt her speech mannerisms when they respond to her will find she is both delighted and bashful, and praises their language-learning ability.\n\"A prinzessin should always give praise where praise is due... Now, let us converse some more. Do not be mistaken; these are to be the foundations of the new world...\"",
            "Character Story 3\tOz and Princess Fischl are not only close friends but also servant and master, with a shared soul and fate.\nTheir first encounter was mentioned in \"Flowers for Princess Fischl (I): End Time Zersetzung\"\nWhen the lone pilgrimaging princess reached the kingdom of eternal twilight, the fate-resisting royals chose to deny everything in their desperation.\nThey refused to recognize Fischl's noble stature and mission as the princess of the Immernachtreich; denied their 13,000-year lineage as a branch of the royal family; and forsook their own nobility and restraints as humans... devolving into clumsy and vicious beasts.\nIn the palace of Twilight and amidst the teeth of the beasts, the princess shed her sacred blood on the ancient emblem.\nAt the moment of her peril, the dark wings of the night ripped the trapped, wounded princess from her despair and took her under its wings.\nFollowing the scent of her noble blood, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, the King of Ravens came to the princess and pledged his eternal loyalty.",
            "Character Story 4\tThere is a story that goes as follows. A long time ago in a place far, far away, there was a tiny little girl.\nThe girl's parents were busy adventurers. She spent most of her childhood in the library, traversing the countless universes that were contained in the pages of the library books.\nShe became the ruler of the Immernachtreich, summoned Thundering Retribution as a royal princess, and formed a soul bond with a Raven...\n...\n\"███, what books did you read today?\" Her parents asked her on one of the rare occasions that they were home between adventures.\nShe proceeded to tell them the story she had read from her favorite series.\n\"...And then he said, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, you are the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.'\"\n\"Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, ███, how about I call you \"Fischl\" too?\" Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her.\n\"Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.\"\nThese kind and loving words lit up her world.\nHowever, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting.\nUnable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself:\n\"I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess. It's true, because Mommy and Daddy said so...\"\n\"Never will I surrender my nobility and dreams, for they are... a princess' rite of passage.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tJust like in the universe of \"Flowers for Princess Fischl,\" entropy begot destruction.\nIn other words: The girl who loved to dream grew up.\nOn her fourteenth birthday, those of her peers who refused to accommodate her quirks belittled her once again.\n\"This is but a minor setback for the noble princess. My parents will understand,\" she thought to herself.\nFor if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams.\nBut when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation.\n\"███, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you...\"\nAnd with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart.\nThat day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well. She had a strange feeling that she was being watched... Suddenly, she heard an otherworldly flapping of wings.\nSure enough, she looked up and her red, swollen eyes met with those of a night raven from another world.\nWhat transpired afterwards is another story...\nFischl doesn't much like this story. Thinking about it causes her to feel suffocating pain and soul-devouring loneliness.\nMaybe one day, this story will be written. But that would be ███'s story, not Fischl's.\nFischl has but one identity: she's the Prinzessin.\nAs long as she remembers this simple and perfect logic, with a little bit of nobility and a touch of kindness from others, nothing can ever hurt her.\nThings are looking up for Prinzessin Fischl these days — not only does she have Oz, but she has finally met a traveler who, just like her, comes from a different world...",
            "Flowers for Princess Fischl: Phantasmagoria\tThe novel series \"Flowers for Princess Fischl\" is available as a collectible set.\nDue to the tiny numbers in circulation, it is a priceless commodity amongst loyal fans of the author.\nBut no matter how elegant these works are aesthetically, their worldview remains incredibly bleak:\nEvery good, bright and noble thing must eventually fall to inexorable entropic destruction, and the final destination of the universe is the realm-in-waiting of the Prinzessin, Immernachtreich.\nThis is the fate of all worlds, of the universe, and all who live in it.\nAnd the Prinzessin and her loyal companion, the \"Night-Severing Raven Oz,\" Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, are the World Beasts who will swallow all dreams.\nAt the very end, at the end of karma itself, she will grant all the gathered souls her benediction, and use her Thundering Retribution to cleanse all that is ugly and wicked.\nThe Prinzessin will then set her own heart ablaze, and the universe shall be born anew in its immortal light.\nBut before all this can come to pass, the Prinzessin must first roam many universes, and see countless new sights.\nThus it is perfectly within the spirit of the original work that the Prinzessin should be stuck as an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild in a slightly backward world. Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.\nThe Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.\nAfter all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these.",
            "Vision\tSo, is Oz just an imaginary friend who only exists as a figment of Fischl's subconscious?\nOur story begins with the royal heirloom, Edelstein der Dunkelheit — that is to say, Fischl's Vision.\nWhen her wish was acknowledged, the raven Oz and her Vision both appeared before her eyes.\nThat night, at dinner, Oz got on most well with Fischl's parents:\n\"Ah, mein Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung, forgive mine overstep, but the beans in your house are too delicious.\"\n\"Oh, then please, help yourself. This is the first time little ███ has met a friend she can bring over for dinner since she turned fourteen. This is a special occasion.\"\n\"W—What are you saying! I... One does not simply cavort with the plebeians!\"\n—And that's what happened.\nFor all intents and purposes, it seems that the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung could both see Oz, and both believed Oz to be the Prinzessin's first friend.\nAs for the \"Adventurer Who Bears the World's Curses,\" the \"Visitor From Outer Worlds\" and the \"Strange Fae-shaped Emergency Sustenance...\"\nThey would become the Prinzessin's new friends, though that would happen even further in the future."

But when \"Father\" took control, this philosophy changed. \"Father\" said that every one of us is important, and we have to value our own lives, be our strongest selves, and stand on our own two feet in this world...

            "More About Freminet: III\tI read in a book that when people die, they turn into stars and watch over us from the sky... I hate my real father.

Will she be... disappointed in me?",
            "More About Freminet: IV\tI don't like thinking about my time in the House of the Hearth under the previous director. All I'll say is... My habit of retreating into the sea started back then. \"Father\" changed not only me, but my view of our family, too. Then Lyney and Lynette joined the family... and for the first time ever, I gained some genuine companions.",
            "More About Freminet: V\tI once swore an oath that I would do whatever it takes to protect this family, and never look back. Now, I stay true to this oath not because it's the previous director's orders, or because it's what \"Father\" expects of me, but because it's my own desire. Please keep our family's secret safe... so that I can keep my promise.",
            "Freminet's Hobbies\tApart from diving, my main hobby is dismantling mechanical things and modifying them. I also collect spare parts, and sometimes I build new clockwork toys out of them. ...Pers? No, Pers is more like family to me. We grew up together... No, I'm serious. I'm always tinkering with it to add more functionality... I truly hope that a day will come when Pers can fly free into the sky.",
            "Freminet's Troubles\t...That's a tough question. I don't have any critical issues that need addressing, but at the same time, there's a long laundry list of minor things which all take their toll. If I was a clockwork toy on the shelf, I wouldn't even know where to start trying to fix me up... But at the end of the day, I guess it all comes down to one thing... I'm just too weak.",
            "Favorite Food\tSeafood. Mainly fish and shrimp, crab's okay too. I'm really glad that Lyney and Lynette share my tastes, because it means we can eat meals together... I don't mind how the ingredients are cooked, though. I leave that decision up to them.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI can't handle coffee. More than half a cup and before long, my heart starts racing and I can't calm my breathing down. Everyone says that coffee can boost your energy levels, but to me, it's torture...",

            "Character Details\tWhether you're a tourist visiting Fontaine for the first time or an adventurer who's set their heart on finding legendary treasures, you're sure to be captivated by the enchantments of the underwater world. But those who attempt to explore the depths without first undergoing rigorous training or making the necessary preparations are gambling with their lives. Treacherous underwater currents, unexpected bodily reactions, and monsters lurking in the deep... Peril always comes without knocking. Seeking the help of a professional diver is always a wise choice.\nIf you ask people who's the most talented diver around, you're likely to hear the name of Freminet. Even old veterans, bronzed and toughened by long exposure to the elements, never tire of lauding his skills. They speak not only of his familiarity with Fontaine's complex hydrological systems, but also of his prowess in coping with different underwater environments and seasonal conditions, as well as his expert control over his breathing. He seems to swim wherever he pleases — even through caverns deep down on the ocean floor, where no one else dares to venture...\nWhen many people hear this, they suddenly think of something or other that Freminet could do for them. But no matter how great the promised rewards, the veterans always respond the same way – with a shake of the head and a regretful sigh.\n\"The boy wouldn't hear of it... He's a nice lad, just a bit too shy.\"\nThe conversation usually stops here.\nAs Freminet sees it, other people's compliments are as capricious as the weather. He finds it hard to fathom their true intentions, and is constantly worried that he'll put his foot in it by saying something wrong.\nPerhaps his true friends are the Tidalga and Romaritime Flowers that he spends so much time with. They hold a much dearer place in his heart than do reputation and reward, which float around on the surface. When he dives, he stays silent for long periods of time in the company of his old friends, and lets the silence swallow up his fears and anxieties. In so doing, he lets out all the things weighing on his mind, all the things that he can't say to anyone else.\nThe reason he chose to dive was that simple — to find some peace and quiet, and escape everything happening in the world above.",
            "Character Story 1\tEven before he received his Vision, Freminet used to love wearing his diving helmet and exploring the underwater world like a penguin.\nHe was never a very talkative child, and whenever something upset him he would plunge into the ocean, leaving his worries on the dry land far above. Over time, the quiet seabed became like a cradle to him, somewhere where he could curl up and feel safe. As the rings of a tree grow outward with each passing year, so too did his curiosity for the underwater world. He listened to the ocean currents with his body, and with each breath grew closer to the water around him. He committed every aspect of Fontaine's hydrology to memory, as if he were memorizing roads around a new home, albeit with far more relish. Eventually, he discovered a place of extraordinary beauty which captured his heart, and built a little secret underwater base nearby. Here, he could let his sunken emotions shine forth with a radiance akin to that of a Lumitoile.\nTo this day, when faced with a particularly thorny problem, Freminet's first thought is to escape to this deep blue sanctuary — so vast and magnanimous that it could embrace all things.\nFree, tranquil, safe, and content... If Freminet were to tell others how the underwater world makes him feel, he would most probably be met with more than a few raised eyebrows.\nBut Freminet would never do this. In his mind, this is his ocean, and his alone. These feelings, hidden deep in his heart, are like sunken treasures buried in the depths.",
            "Character Story 2\tIn the eyes of an onlooker, Freminet doesn't have much of a presence, and comes across as cold almost to the point of being pessimistic. He's always silent, alone, and doesn't seem to enjoy the company of his peers. Compared to his older brother — the legendary Great Magician Lyney — Freminet seems as dull as a piece of old, soon-to-be-forgotten jewelry. But he doesn't care what they think.\nA long time ago, Freminet began trying to strip away excess emotions to prevent his being affected by external pressures.\nAs if building an igloo in his heart, he piled up block after block until he had constructed a translucent refuge, and curled up inside. Clutching his knees, the only thing that gave him solace was reading fairytales.\nIf diving underwater was a way to steal a moment of peace, then sealing himself in a sanctuary of solid ice was actually a way to stay warm.\nFreminet would only ever invite his closest \"kin\" in, and even then, he'd insist on tidying up first, making sure to lock his fairytales away.\nBy the time Freminet left, he'd already turned into a clockwork toy — exquisitely made, yet silent as ever.\nHe once found himself floating on his back upon the waters, unconcerned with his own safety, listening to the unknown songs of Violetgold Angler Gulls circling overhead. In hindsight, it was fortunate that they hadn't mistaken him for a fish...\nIt was in that moment that he discovered how easy it was to just let the currents carry him away.\nNo matter who was asking, and no matter what they wanted, as long as he followed orders unquestionably without a thought for the consequences — like an angler bringing home their catch — he would no longer have to face the endless cycle of castigation and punishment.\nIn the years that children from ordinary families ran about laughing, showing off the latest clockwork toys or picking up phrases from The Steambird, Freminet's heart was gradually becoming numb. Orders filled the void and became like a clockwork spring driving him forward.\nHe used to fantasize about turning into a cold, cruel machine, driven only by the imperative to execute commands. But as he matured, he became increasingly aware of his essential weakness. He wanted to leave emotions behind, but there were too many feelings that he couldn't just cast aside. They would always come back in the dead of night, suddenly gripping him like seaweed wrapping around his limbs. His habit of avoiding problems, his worry that he would not complete his tasks well, his fear of annoying people with his lack of enthusiasm, and his dread of disappointing others — those who meant something to him, most of all...\nHe wasn't an outstanding child, but he simply became hypersensitive to everything in the world he grew up in.\nHe hid himself within a thick shell and yielded to his timidity, until he could only express himself underwater.",
            "Character Story 3\tFreminet was born in the Fleuve Cendre region of Fontaine. Each night he would fall asleep to the sound of drunkards belting out off-key shanties, and wake up to the shrill cries of neighbors cursing outside his window.\nFreminet never met his own father, but he heard from his mother that the man was knee-deep in debt. He had little idea what all these numbers meant, and they were as hard for the little boy to conceive as a dinner in the Palais Mermonia. What he did know was that they were the reason his mother worked from dawn till dusk, day in day out.\nWhen he was home alone, Freminet would often quietly fiddle about with the few devices there were in the house — a portable lamp that never lit up, a wall clock that never ticked, and so on...\nThese things had been lying around for as long as he could remember, as if they were guests who had stopped by for a quick rest after a long saunter, but had never woken back up. Freminet found some tools and, one by one, carefully took them apart. To him, the inner structures of these mechanisms were like mysterious labyrinths. Turn this part here, and another would move as a result. Tap that bit there, and something else would spring out...\nWhen he was with these machines, Freminet felt the same way he did when he read fairytales — like he had taken a magic potion that shrunk him down to the same size as the components. He was moving through a world of cogs and clockwork parts where time seemed to pass without his knowledge. These friends of his, silent yet intriguing, kept him company through many a lonely day.\nOne day, when his mother returned home, she suddenly heard a strange noise that stopped her in her tracks. It was the sound of their clock, which Freminet had unwittingly fixed, ticking away almost as if to celebrate the new lease on life he had given it. She caressed his head and praised him, filling his heart with joy. But when he woke up the following morning, the clock was nowhere to be found. When his mother came home that evening, she brought him two slices of a type of bread he'd never had before. He still remembers the taste to this day.\nFrom that day forth, his mother brought back all kinds of different devices for him — everything from clockwork toys to miniature clocks. Freminet liked his new friends a lot, and would spend a long time \"waking\" them from their slumber, even though they always vanished the following day.\nBut one day, when Freminet ran over excitedly to greet his mother at the door, he had something very special with him — an exquisitely-made music box pendant, about the size of a person's thumb. It had been in such a terrible state when she had found it by the roadside that it was to their great surprise to discover that it still worked.\nA beautiful melody jingled away between them, and seeing Freminet's innocent face light up with pure joy, a rare smile broke out on his mother's, too.\nThis pendant would not leave him, for every evening, his mother would carefully take it off her neck, and together they would listen to its sweet lullaby as night fell.",
            "Character Story 4\tOne day, without uttering a word, Freminet's mother took him by the hand and led him away. As he tried to keep up behind her, little Freminet's palm began to hurt from the strength of her grip.\n\"Mom, where are we going?\" He asked. She didn't reply.\n\"Mommy, why are you crying?\" He asked her again. She suddenly stopped and let out a sob, but only a single one.\nAfterwards, as if resolved to plunge into the freezing depths of the ocean, she took several deep breaths and continued onward. Not another tear fell, but in the oppressive silence Freminet had a vague sense that an ominous current was about to crash against the reef of his future.\nFinally, they arrived in front of an unfamiliar house. As the thick door opened, it let out a harsh creak. It was the type of door that you intuitively knew that, once closed, could never be opened again.\nStill, his mother remained silent. It was as if her expression, weighed down by her heavy heart, had sunk into a bottomless ocean.\n\"Freminet, correct?\" Said a woman as she stepped out. \"Come with me.\"\nConfused, Freminet looked up at his mother. He could feel the tide surging beneath him.\nCalling herself the \"director\", the woman took his other wrist and began to pull him in.\nAll of a sudden his mother's grip tightened, becoming even tighter than when she had led him over. Freminet felt like a boat caught between two waves, completely helpless as they each pulled in opposite directions and showed no sign of letting go.\nAt last, his mother slowly bent down, half-kneeling before him. This was what she would do each day when she said goodbye to him before leaving the house.\n\"Be a good boy,\" she said, kissing Freminet on the forehead in the way she always did.\nThese tender words rose up like a barrier before the jagged reef, instantly turning the raging current into a soft, warm flow.\nSo that's all this is, Freminet thought to himself. Perhaps, like ever and always, this was just to be a brief parting after all.\nHe nodded to set her at ease.\nThe director continued to pull him inside, and this time, his mother didn't try to stop her. Just like that, she let go...\nFor a long time after, Freminet truly believed that as long as he behaved and performed well enough, his mother would come to bring him back home. That her kind face, disappearing behind that thick door, would someday reappear. And parting his fringe, she would kiss him on the forehead once again to tell him how well he'd done.\nBut that day never came.\n\"Still haven't figured it out? You were sold to settle a debt.\"\nAs he grew up, Freminet started to have doubts about where his mother had gone and his own fate. After he finally plucked up the courage to ask the director, this was the heartless response she gave him.\n\"You were abandoned, child. This is the only home you have.\" \"If you don't follow orders, your mother's safety can't be guaranteed...\" Such were the words of the previous director, callous as spiked shackles, locking his wildest hopes inside that door forever. These invisible fetters left a mark of utter abjection on Freminet. In those days, the ocean depths were his sole escape.\nEngulfed by icy-cold seawater, he always felt that little bit closer to her. After all, when those events had transpired all those years ago, had she not sunk to the bottom of the ocean herself? Yet those waters must have been far colder than any he had ever dived in.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter \"Father\" replaced the previous director, Freminet's thoughts began to turn to finding his mother once again.\nAt first, Freminet assumed that she would rile up a still greater storm of brutality, for he knew that her methods were brutal, and he expected new orders to be given just as pitilessly as they had been in the past. But he soon discovered that \"Father's\" way of doing things was utterly different.\nWith \"Father,\" the home was a place of refuge for all the family's children, and as such required a collective effort to maintain. It was up to each of them to complete their tasks in the way that best suited them. Even if they failed, they wouldn't be subjected to the searingly painful punishments they had been previously.\nThis taste of freedom finally gave Freminet the chance to breathe deeply, and he started searching for his mother's whereabouts in his free time.\nBut a long time passed and he still wasn't any closer to finding her.\nPerhaps I really was abandoned, Freminet thought, trying to convince himself to accept reality as he strained to summon the already vague memory of his mother's face.\nBut just as he was thinking of giving up, \"Father\" threw him a pendant.\n\"I found this at the base of operations of those scum. Keep it.\" said \"Father.\"\nFreminet looked back at her, perplexed, which in turn seemed to confuse her.\n\"What it is? I'm talking about those usurious scoundrels. It belonged to your mother...\" She frowned, seeming to suddenly realize something. \"What were you told about her?\"\nFreminet told her what the previous director had said to him, about how he had been abandoned. As he did so, she said nothing, but her eyes began to burn with wrath.\nAfter Freminet was finished, \"Father\" fell silent for a rare moment. \"Do you want to know what really happened?\" She asked, fixing him with a piercing stare.\nFreminet nodded almost unconsciously. But once he had heard what she had to say, he wasn't sure which story he'd rather believe.\n\"Father\" told Freminet that his mother hadn't abandoned him, but on the contrary, had acted to protect him...\nThat year, the debt that his family owed finally reached the point where they would no longer be able to repay it. Those greedy moneylenders had not only forced Freminet's mother to hand over the house that they lived in, but had also demanded that she hand over Freminet as well. But she was his mother — how could she let this happen? In the end, she had no choice but to entrust Freminet to \"that orphanage\" — somewhere they could never get at him — and then face them alone.\n\"This was all I found. As for your mother...\" As she looked at the young boy in front of her, still gripping the pendant tightly in his hands, \"Father\" trailed off and left the ensuing silence to speak for her.\nFreminet's head hung low, but knowing his personality, \"Father\" slipped out of the room without another word. The boy was left standing there, shaking as he gazed down at the pendant in his hands. It had long since rusted and could no longer produce sounds, and the clockwork components seemed to have been stained dark brown by dried blood. She must have been holding it at the very end, he thought. In his despair, Freminet continued to stare at the pendant, desperately looking for even a thread of his mother's warmth.\nThat evening, Freminet dived down to the bottom of the ocean and let it all out. He couldn't remember the last time he had cried like this. Other than the Romaritime Flowers that wept alongside him, not a soul heard the sound of his sobbing, for the ocean smothered it utterly.\nFrom that day on, his grip on his greatsword tightened. He made an oath to himself that he would never again let another member of his family meet with misfortune.",
            "Tales of a Snow-Winged Goose\tFreminet has been captivated by fairytales since he was a child.\nIn contrast with the real world, the little world inside a picture book is always full of color. Castles can be made from candy, rivers from the juice of Bulle Fruits, there can be talking Hydro Crystalflies, and Redcrown Finches and ragdolls can become the best of friends...\nWhen he closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and then opens a storybook, Freminet is able to dive into a magical fairytale world – a world where he can push the boundaries of what exists through a combination of reading and his own imagination.\nAs he goes, he picks up on scattered phrases or illustrations tucked into the corner of the page and turns these over in his mind. He learns something new every time he reads, and loves the variety of dazzling colors and textures that different subject matters seem to evoke for him.\n...\nWhen Freminet starts to feel lonely, \"Pers the Penguin\" waves to him with his black and white wings and slides around on his round little belly as if it were a skateboard. He skids along the surface of the ice until he plops into the sea, challenging Freminet to a fish-catching competition.\nWhen he's feeling timid, \"Princess Marcotte\" with the long, pink hair stares out at him through the window. He knows that when the princess was but a seed, she rode across the ocean on the claws of a crab, abandoning her birthplace for the promise of a better life...\nWhen he's feeling troubled, the inimitable adventurers \"Mr Fox and the Clockwork Guardsman\" appear there in front of him, standing side-by-side. Mr. Fox's great big bottle-brush of a tail raises a cloud of dust as it sweeps the floor, causing the Clockwork Guardsman's nose to become all itchy, but he keeps standing there, as straight and tall as ever. \"Everyone faces challenges,\" they say to him. \"Don't let them win. You're a brave, brave kid.\"\n...\nEven as he matured and grew older, Freminet still stubbornly held on to the fairytale world of his childhood.\nHe truly believes in these beautiful stories and the friends he met in his books.\nIn Freminet's heart, they really do exist in that poetic dreamland of his. There is a place where sadness and worry cease to exist, and all that remains is the unending sound of joyful laughter. It's a place where dreams come true, and justice always triumphs.\nBut of course, he can't actually reach out and touch the things in this imaginary world. Perhaps he'll find a way someday though...",
            "Vision\tThat day, Freminet and some other children were out on an underwater mission. At first, everything went perfectly smoothly, just like it had done on countless other occasions.\nAll of a sudden, however, Freminet noticed that something was off.\nCreatures that know their own weakness always seem able to stay focused in places of great peril, and Freminet is no exception. He has always been skilled at self-reflection, even to the point of picking up on minute changes in his breathing. Without them even being aware of it, his unique powers of perception have helped them evade all kinds of danger.\nFreminet made an emergency gesture to his friends telling them to surface. He still didn't know what the actual peril was, but his nerves had taken hold and his heart began to beat faster and faster.\nHis friends didn't object and, with Freminet at their center, the group began to ascend.\nFor these children, who had yet to receive the gods' favor, ascending was something that had to be done slowly. But at the same time, the feeling of unease in Freminet's heart was becoming unbearable. His vision grew hazy, and he couldn't tell whether it was the reflection of some monstrous leviathan or a sign that he was on the verge of fainting.\nNo. Wait. The diving equipment was malfunctioning! Was it just him? If not, how many of the others were affected?\nHe tried hard to open his eyes, but he was gradually and uncontrollably slipping out of consciousness.\nNo, I have to lead them back, he said to himself. As long as my arms and legs keep working...\nHe began to feel sleepy.\nHis thoughts were becoming sluggish... If this carries on, he thought, I'm never going to make it to the surface.\nEven if I make it, what good would it do? That thought suddenly flashed through Freminet's mind. I'd just go back to living day after day after day, eternally devoid of hope.\nHe felt tired. Tired of forcing himself to keep going.\nHe was unsuited to having so many \"family members.\" There was no real warmth or feelings between them. They were simply a motley crew of clockwork meka, each of a slightly different model and outward appearance.\nPerhaps the seawater was where he belonged after all. To drift off into blissful sleep... Was it really so bad? He gradually let his eyes fall shut.\nA sound suddenly jerked him back awake. Freminet... Freminet. The voice was slow, solemn, and seemed to be coming from the other end of the earth. It also carried a slight stutter.\nPers?\nFreminet stretched out his arms to a blank landscape in front of him, opening his eyes in puzzlement.\nThere was no Pers the penguin in this underwater realm. The children had all slipped into a dreadful torpor.\nI must save them all! Freminet screamed without making a sound. So what if we're not all of the same mind? I won't abandon anyone in my family! No matter what hazards lie ahead, only with the courage to put life itself on the line will I live to see the blue sky that comes after the storm.\nIn that moment, his body seemed to be imbued with power, and even his breathing became grew easy once more. He quickly swam over to his companions, who were each of them drowning...\nIn the midst of a tempest, he saved all of his friends — a miracle of heroism worthy of the legendary Pers from the stories he so loved...\nIt was only then that he realized that a Vision as clear as crystal now hung from his divesuit.\nHe never told a soul what really happened that day. After all, true heroes aren't in it for the recognition."

            "Good Evening\tGood evening. *sigh* Mademoiselle Crabaletta has been muttering about getting in shape lately and even said that she wanted to drag me along with her. Hmph, I'm already eating much healthier than last month. I work very hard to maintain my figure. Hey, you can tell, can't you!?",
            "Good Night\tWhew, I'm getting sleepy myself. See you tomorrow. Remember to wake me up on time...",
            "About Furina: Besties\tHmm? Who are these people at the tea party? Why, they are my loyal followers of course! *sigh* Alright, I suppose I'll introduce them to you. This is Mademoiselle Crabaletta, my most adorable maid... although she accidentally cuts my outfits from time to time... This is Surintendante Chevalmarin, my reliable housekeeper who keeps my busy life in order. And finally, the one keeping everybody in line is Gentilhomme Usher, my loyal conferencier. Hehe, I may have allowed you to participate in my tea party, but you'll still need to work hard to gain their approval!",
            "About Furina: Singing\tI'm very confident in my singing skills, but there aren't many pieces of music that are worthy of my vocal prowess. I hope the creatives in the theater troupe get their act together and don't keep me waiting in vain...",
            "About Us: Relationships\t*sigh* Given that we know each other, you may relax a little and needn't act so respectfully in my presence. Wait, what's that expression on your face? Don't tell me that you've never respected me from the very beginning!?",
            "About Us: Our Story Together\tMy story has already come to an end, and so the next act shall be about OUR story... In which case, we should probably start charging double for public appearances... Oh, I'm so happy!",
            "About the Vision\tOnce the ancient prophecy came to an end and everything was over, I fell into low spirits for a very long time. People who stand on the stage basking in the adulation of their audience must also bear the pressures of being in the public eye and living up to everyone's expectations. But I knew very well my person wouldn't be enough, and that putting on the act of a god would be able the only way to satisfy their adoration... And at the end of the day, all I ever experienced was loneliness. So there came a point when I loathed the very thought of acting and locked myself in my room. It wasn't until the moment I stood on stage and faced the audience again that I realized the anxiety in my heart had dissipated. The reason I can now stand before the crowd's watchful gaze is perhaps because... I have finally started to act as myself.",
            "Something to Share: Opera\tFontaine's opera house has seen several reforms, and with each reform, opposition was to be expected. As I remember, crowds would often gather in the opera house making a ruckus... That one time, it became so loud my ears were ringing. I frightened them by stating, \"I forbid anyone from discussing such pointless matters!\", I clearly remember Neuvillette tapping his cane on the ground at that precise moment while the whole place immediately fell silent. Sometimes I can't help but inadvertently show my intimidating side... I hope my people understands.",
            "Interesting Things: Lumitoile\tI really like the Lumitoile. Those creatures can glow and shine even in places where no one sees them... That's what I call a true \"star.\" Ah, if only there were an opera about the Lumitoile, then I could literally play the role of a lovely rogue starfish on stage.",
            "About Lyney and Lynette\tOf course I know Lyney and Lynette. I used to frequently attend their magic shows. Though they're very popular, they're still much less popular than me. Only my performances would draw a completely sold-out crowd... even standing tickets would be out. But now... Uh... I've already decided to hang up my acting career, so it's perfectly normal for my popularity to decline!",
            "About Neuvillette\tI'm very grateful to Neuvillette for all the hard work he's done for Fontaine in the past few centuries. It seems he doesn't intend to investigate my crimes of deceiving the people. Anyway, we're no longer working in tandem, and it's been a long time since I've been to the Palais Mermonia. I imagine that this is good for both of us, right?",
            "About Navia: Desserts\tHave you tried Navia's macarons? I have to admit that her skills in dessert-making are comparable to mine. The design she paints on the macarons is so cute, don't you think? Not to mention the texture and sweetness... They truly are a work of art! How does she do it? Does it really all boil down to talent? Ugh, I can't believe I'm feeling a little jealous... I'll have to ask her for some tips next time!",
            "About Navia: Inner Thoughts\tShe's a very strong person. Strong people will always manage to keep themselves together no matter what happens, acting like everything is fine. Doing so prevents other people around them from needlessly bearing additional pressure. I saw the duel between Callas and Clorinde... and I can say that in this respect, Navia is becoming more and more like her father.",

No matter how many times I refuse, she still hasn't given up. To be honest, her persistence made me angry at first... but then she told me with a resolute look in her eyes that she wanted to let people understand the real Furina, and that she believed people would understand my troubles. I don't know how to respond to her kind intentions... I suppose she might be right, but I'm just not ready yet...",
            "About Wriothesley\tI haven't communicated with him much, but Neuvillette claims he's trustworthy, so I suppose he must be a good person. Oh, come to think of it, I've received some tea from Wriothesley before and it was exquisite!",
            "About Clorinde\tAs I remember, Clorinde isn't very talkative, but she has stood by me and protected me on several occasions, so I trust her very much. Hmm... I do miss her ever so slightly, but I don't have any real reason to see her now. Oh, right! I should invite her to my next tea party!",
            "More About Furina: I\tYou're interested in hearing about me? *sigh* I suppose there's no helping that... After all, I was once the biggest celebrity of all Fontaine! Every day, countless journalists would come flocking around me, trying to get the inside scoop on my personal life, so I have loads of experience rejecting them. Of course, I don't intend to use this experience on you. With the right delicacies, I might be willing to exchange some of my secrets.",
            "More About Furina: II\tSomeone recently recommended me to try surfing, so I went and gave it a shot. Keeping balance on the rolling waves was a little tricky at first, but I managed to get the hang of it pretty quickly. Maybe I'm just a natural surfer... Anyway, feeling the wind and waves up close and riding along the horizon was rather amazing. You should give it a try!",
            "More About Furina: III\tIf you have time, could you tell me more about your journey? I would love to hear all your fantastic stories. How should I put it... I easily feel interested in all kinds of things, but it isn't long before I feel bored again. Perhaps the more easily enthusiasm sparks, the more quickly it fades. But, when I'm with you, I seem to constantly feel happy... Such an amazing feeling!",
            "More About Furina: IV\tRecently, I've been wondering if I've been a little too hard on myself in the past. In my efforts to maintain the reserved manner of a deity, I never got the chance to enjoy my life, which is why I've become obsessed with shopping lately. I've bought many new precious things... like dazzling rainbow-colored tea bags, fully-automated extendable cutlery, and a saddle specially made for riding Seahorses... But in the end, I realized that most of the stuff I bought was useless, so I sent them all to the troupe to be used as props in performances. Strange... before I bought those things, I was certain they would all be of good use to me...",
            "More About Furina: V\tPeople love talking about the past and often regret the beautiful things that have now faded into history. They also love to talk about the future, as if they're willing to sacrifice everything for an uncertain tomorrow. I don't agree with their way of thinking, yet I also feel very envious... I once lived in a world without a past or a future. To cope with that anxiety, I tried to create and act out a stronger, more god-like version of myself. Over the centuries, the stronger role I tried to play gradually merged with my real self. Even I can't separate the two now... but perhaps there's no need to distinguish them. Experiences of the past have formed who I am now, and that flawed performance has also become the most important part of me.",

            "Favorite Food\tNo one complains about exquisite confectioneries, but it'll take a lot of effort to make some that I like. Listen carefully, desserts are like operas... Everything from choosing the characters to imagining the setting requires a lot of effort in order to make the final performance a hit!",

            "Character Details\tIt is unlikely that travelers from other nations will understand why the god of this land is regarded as a \"superstar\" unless they set foot in the Opera Epiclese.\nWhether at performances or trials, she will always be in the seat reserved for her above the audience, laughing, scolding, falling into hysterics, to the point where more often than not she makes a stronger impression than the action onstage.\nPeople buy tickets to indulge in new sensory experiences, and in this regard, Furina is by far more popular than the absolute justice that Neuvillette represents.\nThe forms respect can take are not limited to just lifting one's eyes up to a being above, and the unique form of respect Fontainians have for Furina is perhaps described better as \"affection and fondness.\"\nShe is not perfect, and may not even be very powerful, but while onstage, she is the personage the people trust the most, for she never disappoints.\nAmong Fontainian literary circles, there is a popular saying that Furina is a memory of spring never-fading, present in the hearts of all. And who does not wish for an eternal spring?\nSpring is transient, but she is ever there — follow the stage lights, and you shall see her.",
            "Character Story 1\tAs the icon of the Opera Epiclese, Furina has the right to speak freely during all stages of a trial.\nMost of her questions are born from her curiosity and often have tenuous logical connections with the case at best, which at times can provoke raucous bursts of laughter from the audience.\nBut just as one might begin to suspect that Furina is just there for laughs and gags, and lacks even the capability to grasp the case in its entirety, she throws out opinions worth their weight in gold.\nOf course, there are also times when she will express little interest in the whole process due to having earlier eaten snacks ill to her liking or missed some parade, but it is said that audience members lucky enough to be there are still pleased with this, as a god who speaks in anger is equally enchanting.\nThere is but one circumstance in which she will not appear to act quite so willfully, and that is when she takes the stage as an actress in a musical.\nFontaine has a great many musical theater classics passed down from antiquity that are, from time to time, performed at the Opera Epiclese, with key roles being played by the most popular actors of the day.\nBefore such productions are put on, there is a phase during preparations that resembles nothing so much as a lucky draw, where the troupe will send Furina an invitation. Should the mood strike her, she will agree to appear, resulting in a stage shared by a god and humans.\nOnce Furina has agreed to participate, the performance date for that show becomes a Fontainian festival in its own right, so popular that the Opera Epiclese couldn't possibly meet the fervent demand even if they sold nothing but standing tickets and were filled to capacity.\nAnd when the music sounds and a god takes the stage, the audience will see not their lovable deity, who does as she pleases, but the character in the script.\nWhether majestic or valiant, conniving or covetous, Furina is a dab hand at playing them all, perfect down to the last gesture, as if she were born to act.\nAnd it is because of her record of wondrous performances that she very much deserves to be called \"superstar\" by her people.\nEven a famous reporter from The Steambird who had barely squeaked their way backstage was completely awestruck, such that it was a long while before they remembered the interview questions in their notebook.\n\"Lady Furina, might I ask how you were able to attain such great mastery acting as an Archon, though no one has ever seen you practice?\"\nFurina's reply was proud, albeit uncharacteristically simple. \"Why, because I am a god. Next question!\"",
            "Character Story 2\tCases and performances take up a great deal of Furina's time, and even without these two things, she still shows up for all kinds of social activities and dinner parties related to government business and diplomacy.\nOf course, social engagement is usually the limit of her remit, while the real behind-the-scenes work, and sometimes even certain important speeches made during these interactions, are handled by others.\nFurina is quite thankful for these proxies, for she has heard that her life of leisure is a rare privilege in a world where most other gods have an endless parade of duties large and small to attend to.\nShe once considered that it might be right to set a... godly example, so to speak, and so she attempted to take part in the Palais Mermonia's day-to-day work when she had an excessive amount of free time on her hands...\nHowever, her offers were respectfully yet consistently declined by both humans and Melusines, who insisted that \"there are no great duties at present that need to be handed over to our god.\"\nThough these words did make her glad, of course, after a few attempts she quickly realized how impractical it would be to use the work of the Palais Mermonia to escape her boredom.\nFurina actually has another hobby, known to very few, and that is playing with little animals.\nFontaine's waterscapes are vast and beautiful, as well as blessed with innumerable adorable creatures. For one who always finds herself interacting with humans like Furina, this serves as an excellent change of pace.\nHowever, animal habits are inconsistent and unpredictable, and Furina's carefree attitude always seems to rub them the wrong way. As in the \"if she's not being blasted in the face by Hat Jellyfish, then she's being pursued to the ends of the ocean by Hunter's Rays\" kind of wrong way.\nIt can be argued that the underwater world is more primitive and wild than the surface world, considering how little respect the animals here give a god on account of her status alone.\nNonetheless, Furina did eventually discover the animal for her ministrations — the sunbathing, beach-loving, horizontal alignment-enjoying Blubberbeasts.\nCheek squeezes, belly rubs, and even flipping them over, then over again, gets at most a turn of the head and noiseless protest.\n\"Hmm? You like it? Hehe, so do I!\"\nA few mild miscommunications aside, they have since become the best of friends.",
            "Character Story 3\tAlthough Furina does tend to give people the impression of one prone to wandering thoughts and only tangential concern for the rules, she does have strict standards — in certain circumstances, anyway, especially before or after performances.\nEverything must be to her satisfaction, be it the make or color of the props, the timing of the brightening and dimming of the lighting, or the pace and rhythm of the music.\nAs such, sharing the stage with a god is not some shortcut to glory, but one paved with blood, sweat, and tears, to the point where even the stories of a hard-to-please superstar prima donna fond of shows and with theatrical swagger to spare has reached even the lowliest street stalls.\nIndeed, there was once a famous troupe that won the chance to perform with her, and pretended to agree to her exacting demands, only to default to methods they were more accustomed to during real rehearsals and performance prep.\nThe troupe director was confident in this method, believing that given Furina's personality, she would be most willing to back down on said demands if she were appropriately flattered and saw that everything was already complete and thus too late to change — a most excellent way to save effort and trouble.\nBut when the director began moving their props to the Opera Epiclese, he found Furina there, directing another troupe as they set up the stage rigging.\n\"Why, hello. You didn't seem interested in my opinions, so I arranged to perform with a different troupe.\"\nThe director was stunned. He had planned for Furina to discover the \"flaws\" in her view only after setup was complete.\nBut he could already tell that the stage sections that had been constructed precisely in accordance with her directions were significantly superior. Ordinary audience members couldn't necessarily tell, of course, but to professionals, the difference was always in the details, and these were obvious at a glance.\nStill, this director was unwilling to simply turn back, criticizing Furina for not adhering to the spirit of contractual obligation by not informing them beforehand of her contingency arrangements.\nFurina would not let this villain cast the first stone, instead scrunching her face into an expression of disbelief.\n\"You don't really think I'm that much of a gullible fool, do you? Guards! Send them on their way.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tRound and round the interminable performance went, the day of the curtain call ever beyond reach, but so long as the prophecy loomed, the tale of this god must go on.\nThough Fontainians found no real reason to doubt Furina over the years, she knew that the collapse of trust could begin with a single crack. No matter how small, once it appeared, it would be irreversible.\nAnd the consequences of being exposed would be to reduce all her long years of work to dust, to allow Fontaine to fall — that was unconscionable!\nSo she did her best to laugh loudly when she should be glad, and weep bitterly when she should grieve, and display the divine bearing of an Archon when it was time to show off, all without fail, all without rest.\nShe knew that this was a performance. If she could endure until the danger had passed, she could finally take off her mask and regain the freedom to express her feelings.\nYet, she slowly began to realize that the godly role she was playing was eating into her.\nA horrifying doubt began to creep up on her — how should she react when glad, if not to laugh loudly?\nPerhaps she was once a girl who did not much enjoy laughter. Perhaps she had once been the sort to give up on herself at the first sign of difficulty, but such emotions had already slipped away, bit by bit.\nThose in the performance arts often say that one must become a character to play them.\nFrom that perspective, Furina's performance as the Hydro Archon has been flawless. Her painstaking perseverance produced the perfect product.\nBut no one has ever spoken of what might transpire once the last light had dimmed, for to them, the stage is fleeting.\nFor one such as Furina, who has acted for far too long, even the path back offstage has faded into dust, buried by the sands of time.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe crisis of original sin was resolved, and Fontaine came under a new order. The affected areas were gradually rebuilt, and the people held high hopes for the future.\nFurina was the only one with no place in this new world. She was quick to pack her bags and leave the Palais Mermonia, nor did she return to the Opera Epiclese.\nShe simply wanted to leave the memories that brought her so much pain as far behind as possible, and she was uninterested in the debates surrounding her — the Hydro Archon's tale was over, as it should be.\nBut where should an actress who had finished her part and fulfilled her duty go? None could say, and the concept of \"freedom\" rang hollow.\nFurina's luggage remained piled up in her new rental apartment, and she lacked all will even to tidy up or get moved in. All she could do was lie in bed and stare at the bare ceiling.\nThose she knew had very quickly found their place in the new order. Whether due to their strength, duties, or friendships, their importance made them irreplaceable.\nIn circumstances such as these, didn't \"free\" simply mean being someone who no one needed?\nJust as she had reached this conclusion, her new residence received its first guest — Clorinde the Champion Duelist.\nThe duelist was shocked at Furina's living conditions, quickly expressing her willingness to pay for better accommodations, a notion Furina expended no small amount of effort disabusing her of. Despite this, she was dragged, however reluctantly, into at least properly unpacking and tidying up the room.\nClorinde then explained that she was here to invite Furina to a gathering. The duelist rarely took part in social events, but this gathering was one of old friends, who, as it happened, also knew Furina, and whom Clorinde had not seen in a while, anyway, so she thought she'd extend an invitation.\nIn days past, Furina would certainly have refused, for the greater the intimacy of her association with others, the more difficult it would be to conceal her true identity.\nThe duelist smiled as Furina guiltily lifted her eyes, having seemingly already guessed the latter's feelings as well as her old reasons for snubbing such events.\n\"I don't suppose you have any reason to refuse now, do you?\"\n\"Well... I'm not very good at this sort of thing, so, um... Don't you think I'd, you know, be a bit of a wet blanket?\"\nThat night, Furina finally got to experience what it was like to revel and drink with friends. In truth, she was cautious at first but was restored to her normal self within two cups — indeed, so much so that at one point Clorinde had to restrain her from leaping onto the table.\nFor someone as reticent as the duelist, the real Furina's explosiveness was quite the surprise.\nAs for Furina, she still knew not where to go, but if nothing else, she now knew that \"freedom\" did not mean solitude.",
            "Salon Solitaire\tFurina once found a relatively unknown book in a library of Fontaine, and the story's main character was a servant working in an opulent mansion.\nThe idealistic young Mademoiselle Crabaletta, following a newspaper advertisement, came to a remote manor in the mountains to apply for employment, and despite her clumsiness, became a maid there all the same.\nThe Master of said mansion did not appear often, and though his loquacious surintendante and etiquette-minded gentilhomme managed it in his absence, she led a carefree life there.\nNone of the manor's attendants had been to the city in quite a long while, and so the maid taught them to sing the latest songs, play the latest tabletop games, and thus the servants grew closer and enjoyed one another's company.\nThere was but one ironclad rule, which was that none should approach the heavy wooden door that led three floors underground, behind which was locked a secret that only the Master of the mansion was privy to.\nThough the maid was curious, she treasured her vibrant life there too much to pry. Time passed quietly, and one day, they were told by the gentilhomme that the Master was about to visit, and so the servants hurriedly began to prepare.\nThe banquet was akin to a festival, and laughter and cheer filled every corner of the mansion — at least, until the Master was late the second day, and upon investigating, the maid was to discover his already-cold corpse.\nThe Gardes narrowed the suspects down to the servants, but the maid, convinced that the Master's death had something to do with the mansion's secret, at last decided to open that forbidden gate.\nTo her surprise, what awaited her on the other side was the mansion's main hall, upon the central stairs of which stood the all-too-familiar surintendante of the house. The words she spoke, too, were bizarrely known to the maid.\n\"Ah, you must be our newest applicant. Crabaletta, I believe?\"\nFurina was quite dumbfounded when she read that, for the story here recalled similar events in her memories.\nShe admired the happy lives of the maid and the other servants, and the maid's courage in facing down the ancient secret to defend that life.\nLater, Furina dreamt of that same mansion. In her dream, she was Crabaletta, huffing and puffing as she ran to that door of secrets, and, with one deep breath, pushed it open.\nBehind it was a torrent of seawater that drowned the mansion in an instant, dissolving all in its wake — the Gardes, the surintendante of the house, the gentilhomme, and even herself.\nFurina woke with a start, looking around her to gather her wits, and the rest of the story sprang to her mind, unbidden...\nCrabaletta made use of the time loop triggered by opening the door to solve the mystery of the Master's death and discover the mansion's secret, freeing all its inhabitants from an ancient curse.\n\"Thank you, Crabaletta.\"\nShe thanked the brave, stalwart girl for giving that tale a happy ending.\nAnd as for several vivid figures from the story, they would eventually be given lovely forms, that they might be by Furina's side.",

            "Character Details\tGoods flow through Yilong Wharf round the clock, and the merchant convoys and their cargo have need of guards to escort them through the various regions of Liyue to other lands.\nSince ancient times, such escort work has been no easy task. Even in an era of relative safety on the roads such as this, any one escort run could involve any number of variables.\nPerhaps this employer might change the route on an ad hoc basis, or perhaps that customer will nitpick and refuse to accept the goods, never mind how the roads do not lack for all manner of petty crooks if one is fortunate, and big-time bandits if one is not.\nAlthough the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency has no shortage of capable, skilled staff, were you to comb through all their roster, the only one among their ranks who can keep clients happy while beating any brigands down is Gaming.\nThe merchant guilds, for their part, are quite eager to have this young, competent guard to escort their cargo, and Gaming is no less popular on the streets outside of work than he is in his professional capacity. Indeed, any and all friends of this busy fellow will rate him two thumbs up.\n\"It was a piece of cake! Come see our Wushou Dance when you're free! Don't worry, just enjoy the show, and we'll call it even. Thanks in advance, haha!\"\nWhenever someone on the receiving end of his help wants to return the favor, this will be his jocular reply.",
            "Character Story 1\tGaming was born in Qiaoying Village, a place famous for its tea, and his ancestors had been tea farmers for several generations, only switching to mainly selling tea leaves during his father Yip Tak's time. With his parents working together, their business was getting better by the day, and of course, any father would hope for his son to succeed him in the family business.\nThanks to his father's hard work, at least Gaming no longer had to experience the backbreaking daily grind of farm work, nor would he have to start a business from scratch. But as they say, \"like father, like son\" — Gaming turned out to have his own ideas about which road to tread, just as his father had chosen to diverge from Gaming's grandfather's decision to keep growing tea.\nThe two were at an impasse, with neither accepting the other's view. Only Gaming's eventual departure from their home put a stop to the arguments between father and son.\nFor his next haunt, Gaming chose the bustling Yilong Wharf, having planned out how he'd make his living a while back — through a passion of his that had burned since childhood, Wushou Dance, of course.\nFilled with enthusiasm and confidence that created complacency, the young man blazed through creating all the relevant props, even printing flyers introducing himself and booking performance venues... He planned to plant his feet first in Yilong Wharf, then conquer Liyue Harbor, and finally, to introduce Wushou Dance to Teyvat at large...\nSuffice it to say that the diligent youth's passionate pursuit of his dream sent all of the business startup funds he had saved up before leaving home up in smoke, leaving him quite broke in short order.\n\"Making Wushou Dance your career? As if! Forget making a living, hah, you'd be lucky not to starve!\"\nHungry as he was, Gaming now understood his father's words.\nWith the mindset \"What's done is done, let's focus on getting a meal first,\" Gaming had little choice but to find a job that could put food on his table.\nFortunately, fate has a habit of giving right after taking. Lantern Rite was just around the corner at the time, and the good-hearted young man led a Fontainian merchant to the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency just as a lead guard was fretting over a manpower shortage. Gaming took the opportunity to recommend himself and was promptly taken on as a temp employee.\nThanks to his daily Wushou Dance training, he had a strong foundation in martial arts and tenacity in the face of hardship, and was promptly asked to stay on as an official guard for hire after finishing that escort run.\nAll in all, that definitely counted as feeding himself through Wushou Dance... right? That was how Gaming saw it, anyway.",
            "Character Story 2\tLanguage is one of the most important tools for communication between people, and Gaming's distinctive way of using this \"tool\" is especially interesting.\n\"C'mon, buddy, I really don't want you to end up in some kinda jam too sticky for dipping to be an option!\"\n\"Hang on a sec. How would I ever get stuck in jam? And how would dipping even help in that situation?\"\nAnd whenever the other party gets confused, Gaming will try supplementing his explanation through different methods, complete with various gesticulations to demonstrate his point.\nThis manner of speaking, he explains, he got from his mother, who married into Qiaoying Village from afar, and to whom he was quite attached after his birth. He would follow her just about everywhere, and in his doings and interactions with others, he would pick up many of her habits and interests.\nNothing to do? Get some dim sum. Feeling hot and woozy? Brew up some cooling tea. Eating a meal? Got to have some greens... and no, melons and fruits are not greens.\nThese habits are not ironclad, of course. If a friend came up with some new suggestion, he would be game to try it out. People from all lands were brethren, after all, and it is Gaming's way to treat all with sincerity.\nHe can easily shoot the breeze with just about anyone in Yilong Wharf, young or old. At first, most think his polite speech to just be pretty pleasantries, but after some time, they will find that he is being perfectly earnest. He will introduce the itinerant handyman Duqin to work opportunities, assist the ever-busy Zhigui, fetch medicinal wines from Liyue Harbor for his fellow guards, and even get Dip Yeuk to give a Suanni-themed toy to a child whom he himself has never met, all because Dip once mentioned that the boy liked watching Wushou Dance...\nPriceless is the friend who knows your heart, and so everyone returns the favor to this big-hearted lad. They always invite him to come in and rest his feet when he comes by with a delivery, and there is always a seat for him at a dim sum table — well, on the condition that he doesn't say \"I'll foot the bill.\"\nGaming often claims that he'd never have gotten far in Yilong Wharf without everyone's help, but those familiar with the humble, earnest lad know that he would have been fine no matter where he was.",
            "Character Story 3\tPractice makes the professional. As such, no matter how busy work gets at the transport agency, Gaming will take time to train.\nAt meals, Gaming may be found tussling cheekily with his colleagues over dishes, wielding his chopsticks like a seasoned duelist, while under the table his knees are bent in a low horse stance, sturdy as a mountain. After the cargo is packed, he will rarely get a cart to move it to a warehouse but instead will lift it all himself, box by box, to train his arm strength.\nThe lead guard knew that their work was hard and laborious, and so from time to time would call for suggestions on items that might be added to the office for relaxation purposes.\nSoft beds, comfortable pillows, Genius Invokation TCG decks...\nAt that moment, Gaming cleared his throat and said: \"If possible, could we have some Plum Blossom Poles installed in the front yard so we can train better? Bet if we firm up our fundamentals, it'll make our work a whole lot easier!\"\nHis words were met with silence. Everyone was just discussing where to go after work, and here was someone saying that overtime was the best break. Why, this was a crime most heinous, and \"punishment\" was in order! So they gathered about him like bees in a hive, some \"screeching,\" others \"pleading,\" still others pretending to \"advise\" him, laughing and cavorting.\n\"Have mercy on me and accept my apologies, brothers, and thank you for giving me my minute of glory. How about this, then? How about I treat you all to some dim sum? Will that make amends?\"\nThis sort of horsing about happened every so often among the guards, of course. Everyone knew that Gaming wanted the Plum Blossom Pillars for Wushou Dance practice, and everyone was just playing along with him, wagging their tongues and fingers and feigning their reactions so his birthday surprise wouldn't be spoiled. In truth, they had already stacked those pillars up outside — all that remained was for them to put them up together.\nDuring their downtime, Gaming also often invites his fellow guards to take up Wushou Dance, and everyone has indeed tried it at least once on account of it \"looking totally dope,\" though almost none have persevered for long, with one of them even joking that:\n\"If we put suffering on a podium, we guards would get bronze, Wushou Dance masters silver, and Gaming would get gold, since he does both!\"\nNot wrong, in truth.",
            "Character Story 4\t\"Our kid from another family.\" This is the highest of the glowing evaluations Gaming has received from the streets of Yilong Wharf. And little wonder. He's a mature and decent sort, and having left his home, he has earned his status and reputation without relying on anyone else.\nOnly those aunts and uncles who saw him grow up know that he was once the notorious \"demon king\" of Qiaoying Village.\nIf he wasn't climbing up the roof tiles, he was grabbing at the bird nests in trees, and he would go into the fields with the adults to harvest tea, to the point where his father paying damages to the neighbors for those incidents was practically routine.\nIn truth, however, he climbed up the house beams to help his father store a private stash of Mora, and he rummaged through bird nests to help his mother collect feathers for head ornaments, and he was thrashing in the fields trying to capture pests and harmful bugs...\nAs an oddball, Gaming's head is always full of strange, bright new ideas, leaving others quite dumbfounded, and so his parents only ever spoiled him more despite his mischievousness.\nHaving heard that a somewhat famous Wushou Dance troupe from Yilong Wharf would be performing in Qiaoying Village, his father had handed work over to his assistants long beforehand, preparing to get Gaming one of the best seats to the watch the spectacular show.\nBut on the day of the dance itself, he tarried too long at the tea table as he dined on dim sum with his friends, and by the time Gaming had pulled both parents before the stage, it had already been ringed by spectators thrice and thrice again. There would be no watching the Wushou Dance today, it seemed.\n\"Daddy's a cheat and a fibber! You said we'd go see the big Suanni!\"\nThere was no comforting him by this point. Even attempts to placate him with promises of purchasing toys were drowned out by his cries.\n\"Little kids who don't listen to their parents will get eaten by the Suanni! Check out how fierce it is!\"\nSo saying, Gaming's father lifted the boy atop his shoulders. At that moment, the Suanni onstage leapt onto a tall pillar, and it turned and looked, locking eyes with Gaming.\nAll at once the boy stopped crying, staring with wide eyes and open mouth at the dance taking place onstage. After the show had ended and the crowd dispersed, Gaming continued to gaze back in the direction of the stage the whole way home. Only then did his parents see that something was amiss. Could he have been frightened so by the words spoken previously?\n\"Ah, Gaming, no need to be scared. That wasn't a real Suanni! There were people inside, and they don't eat children...\"\n\"Daddy! I wanna watch the show again! I wanna be like that big Suanni. Raaaarr!\"\nFrom that day forth, Gaming, once whimsical (some might say half-hearted) in all his fancies, became utterly consumed with Wushou Dance, often badgering his father to take him to see shows, and his indiscriminate mischief-making gradually turned to (what he thought was) meticulous and well-planned Wushou Dance training.\nAt least eight bamboo baskets became casualties of his road to mastery in lifting the beast's head, cruelly felled by kicks.\nAs for the various rice and soup spoons that went missing around the house, they were no doubt taken to be used for drum practice, dragging not a few basins and benches down with them.\nOnce, Gaming went with his father to purchase a batch of new tea from the farmers, when a bamboo basket was passed to him, he performed a \"Suanni's Salutation\" on reflex, raising the basket and beginning to dance. The tea leaves were scattered everywhere, and Gaming wound up being chased around the village with his father in hot pursuit. And when the father finally returned, pulling his son by the ear, their meal had already gone cold, and the mistress of the house had long been waiting expectantly at the door for their return, rattan rod in hand...\nIn spring, autumn, winter, and summer, his parents would sit at home, his father nursing some tea and his mother snacking on melon seeds, and watch their son jump up and down, beast-head in hand...\nIt is a pity that such days, so ordinary they could not be more ordinary, can now only return in dreams.",
            "Character Story 5\tChildren really do change as they grow up, and that little child engrossed in watching Wushou Dance grew to become a spirited youth. The one thing that did not change was his passion for Wushou Dance, and still he dreamed of making it big in Liyue Harbor one day. But compared to Yilong Wharf, things were different there. In Liyue Harbor, Wushou Dance was seen as a new-ish folk practice that originated in Chenyu Vale — it was appreciated, sure, but it was no money-maker, and certainly not ingrained in people's hearts in the same way Liyue opera was.\nThe more Gaming's father watched his son bustle about tirelessly, the more he worried about the youth's future, and not a few times did he speak seriously with the boy about the difficulties of starting a business. And each time, Gaming would retort that staying in business was harder yet, and declined to succeed his father in the tea leaf business. In earlier years, when his mother was still around, any impasse between the two could be broken up around the dinner table, but after she passed from illness, it was as if the glue from this father-son relationship had come unstuck, and they grew distant.\nGaming's father blamed her falling ill on the immense amount of labor she had put into starting the business with him, and by extension, himself. If something were to happen to their only son, how could he ever face her? And thus, when Gaming was once again injured when practicing Wushou Dance, he could take no more, and gave all of his son's equipment away, leaving only the beast head his wife had made. To his shock, Gaming left without a word the very next day, taking said head with him.\nIn truth, his son's departure did not only leave him angry, but also stewing in a melange of emotions and wavering reflection. He had in fact been constantly asking those close to him at the Communications Office to help take care of his son over the years, but whenever Gaming came up in conversation, his words could be brutal and blunt — nor would he put aside his pride to proactively mend relations.\nLeong, an assistant to the business, would write to Gaming come every festival, discussing some awkward matters that were neither here nor there — and of course, even a witless twit could guess that he was doing so at the behest of Gaming's father. Even so, Gaming was not as headstrong and free-spirited as he often appeared, and he never exposed Leong, instead going along with the letters, even asking after matters at home, intentionally or otherwise...\nTo Gaming, reading Leong's letters was akin to defusing a bomb, and in truth, he sometimes hoped to receive nothing at all. Just as he once feared that the villagers might come and say \"Your father's on his way to give you a good whooping,\" he now feared that someone might say \"Your father was at home when he had a fall\"... Whether then or now, no news was good news.\nThus did father and son continue to be stubborn, each seemingly convinced that the other would understand them in time... Gladsome was it, then, that ever-ardent Ms. Xianyun would intercede before such reticence could turn to regret. With the bridge she built, and with the aid of able allies, Gaming's father was finally able to center himself and find calm, finishing watching his son's masterful, exciting Wushou Dance performance. From awkwardness to active dialog they went, and at last, they were again able to open up to each other, with Gaming's father accepting his son's career choice.\n\"Well, remember to come watch next time I perform in Liyue Harbor.\"\n\"I don't need you to tell me that.\"\n\"In that case, don't chat too long over dim sum, or you might not be able to squeeze your way in when you come late...\"\n\"You rascal!\"",
            "To My Boy, Gaming\tGaming doesn't like reading, but he has kept a book under his pillow for years. Tucked inside its pages is the only letter his mother ever wrote to him.\n\"...The thing I'm most worried about after I'm gone is that you and your father will get into arguments every day. All this agitation is simply no good for anyone. Don't blame your dad, he's more bark than bite. He's just concerned that you'll have a tough time on your own in the future and doesn't want you to go through such hardships. Do you remember that time when you sprained your leg? Your father was so anxious that he ran frantically to the physician, with you on his back. He was worried sick, and he secretly cried under the blankets that night. You are a big boy now, do show some consideration for your dad and let him have his way sometimes. Don't quarrel with your dad if you can help it...\"\n\"...Don't worry, I'm not against you learning Wushou Dance. In fact, I'm glad that you found something you like and enjoy doing while you were young. But you have to promise me to be careful and not force yourself so you don't get hurt! And please be careful not to eat anything too heaty, cold or raw, and don't be too picky about what you eat and drink... Remember to wear more layers when it's stormy and raining, don't neglect keeping yourself warm just because you want to look cool!\"\n\"...As you step into society, you have to stay true to yourself. Don't let yourself or others down. The worst thing you can do is to make empty promises and be someone who is 'all talk, no action.'\"\n\"There's no harm in knowing more people. If you find a friend who you can really connect with, you absolutely must treat them well with a sincere heart. It's not about the number of friends you have but the quality of your friendships. You should count yourself lucky if you find someone you can rely on. I know you won't want to talk to your dad about things that are bothering you, so just find a friend whom you can share your woes with. No matter what you do, don't bottle up your feelings, and definitely don't do anything silly, alright?\"\n\"I'm feeling a little tired, so I'll take a rest now. I know I always say, 'You little rascal, I wish I'd given birth to a chunk of char siu instead of you,' and you always sulk when you hear it... But I want you to know that you're not a little rascal and that you're so, so much better than a piece of char siu... You will always be my little boy that I cherish and love most in the world...\"\nJudging from the creases, the letter has been opened and put away again and again. Placing it between the pages of a book was indeed a clever way to preserve the letter.\nThe book in which he kept the letter had been used by his mother as a coaster for her teacup, and now that it had passed down to Gaming, he too had found a new purpose for it.\n\"Mom actually told me I should read more. Please, has she ever opened the book herself? Oh, oops, pretend I didn't say anything! Otherwise, Mom will give me a good whacking in my dreams!\"\nGaming never cries when he talks about his mother in front of others. He knows she would have wanted him to be optimistic and happy and move on with his life. And that's exactly what he did.\nIt's just that the wind always blows sand into his eyes when he's alone and when he's thinking about his mother, even when he's in his bedroom, where there's neither wind nor sand.",
            "Vision\tA certain question had always vexed Gaming — what does a Suanni look like, exactly? Having asked his seniors, he found out that they had never seen a real one either, and they had relied on their teachers to hand down the art of Wushou Dance to them. If he really wanted to find out, it was going to be an adventure unto itself.\nRandom chance allowed him to borrow a few old texts about the solitary Suanni hidden in the mountains from Xingqiu. Several nights did he do battle against the unfamiliar words that rushed his position like a relentless army of ants, only to be defeated at last, remembering only a few key phrases like \"fierce,\" \"majestic,\" and \"untamed.\"\nA giant beast of most heroic bearing indeed! He was sure that if only he could lay eyes upon it, he would gain much inspiration for his Wushou Dance performances. It was with this belief that Gaming would often poke about the locations the books mentioned. And when he came to Mt. Lingmeng, he sensed an oppressive aura about, as if a pair of eyes hidden in the bushes were watching him. This was it, Gaming intuited.\nBefore dawn broke the next day, he made himself presentable, and brought his favorite beast head and a big bag of food offerings into the mountains. Suddenly, a strong gust blew by, and before he could react, a dark shadow had swooped about him, looping around him in circles. He immediately closed his eyes and clapped his hands together, stating his intent in a reverent and loud voice.\n\"O Great Suanni, Gaming greets you! I came here simply to witness your majesty... and I brought lots of good food for your enjoyment, too! Now, ah, if you don't mind, could I open my eyes?\"\nHearing no more movement, he slowly re-opened his eyes, only to witness a large... difference between how he had imagined a Suanni to look and this cute little creature that sat proudly upon a giant stone.\n\"Whoa, seriously!? You're so tiny! And cute! Who's a good Suanni? That's right, you are! C'mon, let me give you some headpats, and...\"\nIn his excitement, Gaming overstepped and displeased the Suanni, and though it was indeed very small, it had an extraordinary energy about it, and like a furious flame it jumped all around the young man until he grew dizzy, the items he had brought dropping from his hands. Almost unconsciously, Gaming grabbed at the beast head and began dueling the creature. What the Suanni would do, Gaming would imitate, and so they continued from daylight till dusk — to a bystander, they might even have seemed like playmates meeting again after a long separation. Finally, the Suanni seemed to acknowledge him, and as it shook its head about, a shiny stone popped out of its mane.\n\"Really? A Vision, too? Is this what they mean by 'good things come in pairs'?\"\nCarefully did Gaming approach that stone, finding it to be an absolutely real, positively genuine chunk of ore that had only shone under the glare of the setting sun.\nAh, a misunderstanding, then. It was a shame, of course, but it did not dampen his mood — indeed, it was from this moment that the \"Mighty Mythical Beasts\" troupe was formally founded.\nFrom that day onward, Gaming and Man Chai were inseparable, and he quickly forgot about that whole Vision affair...\nSome time later, Gaming was escorting a merchant caravan when he encountered a ruthless gang of bandits. The merchants advised him to retreat — lost cargo could be written off as a cost of business, but lost lives could not.\n\"Hah! I've never been able to stand those who steal and rob for a living. Even if I wasn't on the job, I'd give them a piece of my mind, and as it happens, making them regret their life choices is my job and I'm on the clock. You go first, boss, and I'll hold the line here. I guarantee not one crate will be lost, nor will a single hair on your heads be harmed!\"\nThus did Gaming go one against ten, and though he sustained numerous injuries, he persevered until all the brigands were bound, and both the Millelith and his colleagues had arrived, before allowing himself to slump over.\nThe merchants would later inspect their goods, only to find that, indeed, not a single item was missing, and there was even something that had not been in the manifest — a Vision.\nThey wrapped the item carefully before having it delivered, alongside the thank-you plaque they gave Gaming, to the Sword and Strongbox Agency.\nGaming was caught completely off-guard by the gem, with only surprise and not gladness registering in his heart, which was instead overwhelmed with a series of questions.\n\"What, really? Is this mine? I mean, I was just escorting some goods, nothing special. I mean, don't I do that every day?\"\n\"Should I return it? But to whom? The caravan? No, wait, they said it wasn't theirs... Could it have been... that no-good low-down crook's?\"\n\"No, no, what am I thinking! Well, in that case... I guess this Vision really maybe probably might be mine, then?\"\n\"But I've heard that they have to do with strong wishes. I didn't get it back when I was dancing in front of Man Chai, and now I just... randomly got it on the job. Does that mean... that I was always meant to be a guard, but I was led astray by Wushou Dance?\"\n\"Is this a hint that I should give up on it? In that case, I'd rather not have this Vision at all!\"\nThis lasted until he got the wrapping cloth off the plaque—\nAnd then he saw it, shaped as it was: like a beast of good omen, ears and eyes on the alert, seeing and hearing all.\nThe defeat of these crooks, he realized, was a deed that made him akin in spirit to the monster-subjugating Suanni.\nOnly then did the doubt clouding over Gaming's heart clear, and in response, he cleaned his hands on his clothes before accepting this Vision with all due ceremony."

            "Character Details\tThough many in Liyue are fascinated by life in Yujing Terrace, its day-to-day operations and rules are a mystery to them.\nThey are aware that the Liyue Qixing are the cream of the crop who hold the fate of the city in their hands, but the calculations and data behind the Qixing's every decision are far harder to grasp.\nThe people understand that the new policies announced each year will change the dynamics of the market, yet none can comprehend how policy is plucked from complex meeting minutes and compiled into something easier on the human eye.\nAs the secretary of Yuehai Pavilion, Ganyu undertakes many tasks that ordinary folk do not see.\nFor those that have witnessed her standing by the dock at daybreak, enjoying her breakfast in silence, it is difficult to imagine her in such a post.\nEven still, by the time the sun has fully risen, she will have returned to Yuehai Pavilion overlooking Yujing Terrace, to continue to fulfill her contract.\nA contract that she signed three thousand years ago with Rex Lapis.",
            "Character Story 1\tGanyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. \"What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished.\"",
            "Character Story 2\t\"I work for the well-being of all living things in Liyue.\"\nUnder almost all circumstances, Ganyu is a very trustworthy secretary.\nIt is hard to imagine anyone outperforming her in the face of such an enormous workload, especially given her unique and penetrating insights into all of Liyue's matters.\nNevertheless, her reliability can only be guaranteed under \"almost all circumstances.\"\nThe more important the matter, the more Ganyu strives for perfection, and the more nervous she becomes. Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.\nOne such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.\nGanyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.\nLater on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.\nHer colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.\nThose who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.\nThose closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused.\n\"I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite...\"\nNeedless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!",
            "Character Story 3\tHow long is a thousand years?\nLong enough for the Glaze Lilies that once teemed throughout Dihua Marsh to be wiped out by floodwaters, and long enough for the thriving settlement that sprung up upon Guili Plains to come to ruin in war.\nHow short is a thousand years?\nTo Ganyu, it has felt shorter than the blink of an eye.\nThroughout a passage of time unimaginable to mortals, Ganyu has been working on all manner of things at Yujing Terrace.\nShe recorded the raising and demolishing of every building, and witnessed the rise to prosperity of every industry.\nGanyu's sense of objectivity towards the passage of time comes from the endless reams of data she must trawl through, and from the ever-increasing number of colors she finds that she needs to categorize it all.\nAll this time, her mindset has never changed — she constantly wavers between her human and adeptus halves.\nOn one hand, Ganyu the qilin finds it difficult to comprehend mortal squabbles.\nBut on the other hand, her human blood reminds her always to hold out hope that she might someday be able to fit in.",
            "Character Story 4\tOutside the confines of her work, Ganyu very quickly shows how different she is from most other people.\nShe has a habit of taking afternoon naps and has a shockingly accurate internal clock. When lunch hour arrives, no matter where she is, she will simply curl up into a ball and fall asleep on the spot. Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.\nThese habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.\nBut once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.\nUnable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.\nAfter receiving a stern admonishment to \"only take afternoon naps where it's safe,\" Ganyu retorted:\n\"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?\"\nPerhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans.",
            "Character Story 5\tGanyu's qilin heritage is little-known in Liyue Harbor.\nWhenever she is asked by someone walking along Feiyun Slope as to the obvious protrusions in her hair, she says that they are ornamental heirlooms.\n\"If I told them the truth, they would distance themselves from me...\"\nDespite never having been on particularly close terms with Liyue's citizens in the first place, Ganyu would still not consider distancing to be a good thing.\nHer more important reason for hiding the truth is to prevent curious onlookers from touching her qilin horns.\nAfter all, a qilin's horns are a sensitive part of their body, both physically and mentally speaking.\nAnother secret that Ganyu is anxious to keep hidden is the fact that she is watching her physique.\nThe qilin are strict vegetarians, but Liyue is a veritable powerhouse of gastronomical delights, one in which even vegetarians struggle to control their appetites.\nGanyu, who has grown accustomed to city life, is thus very vigilant in matters concerning her weight and physique.\nWhenever she finds herself being drawn towards some delicious dish, she will attempt to reassert her self-control. For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.\nBut she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.\nDuring the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.\nFor Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must.",
            "The Flora of Yujing Terrace\tHandwritten notes detail the morphological features and behaviors of the plants in Yujing Terrace, with each beautiful stroke penned by Ganyu's own hand.\nThe notes are succinct, comprehensive, and well-categorized, and even offer some insights that one would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere on the market.\nThese include pointers on caring for Glaze Lilies and methods for grafting Silk Flowers.\nIn readability and scientific accessibility, they come close to the standard of official publications.\nOr rather, this is the experience if one starts reading from the front.\nSkip to near the end, however, and one may well be left dumbfounded.\nThe final few pages are a shocking rash of black ink and frantically scribbled-out text.\nReading patiently and painstakingly between the lines, one might just discover that these notes were, at one time, various methods for vegetable cultivation.\n\"But if I learn to grow vegetables, I'll be even less able to control my appetite.\"\nHer hands balling into fists, it was with much difficulty that Ganyu erased the results of her research.\nLater, whilst watering the plants on an empty stomach, Ganyu found herself plunging her head into a thicket of Silk Flowers, fantasizing that they were Sweet Flowers in an effort to comfort herself.\nMany more fantasy Sweet Flowers followed shortly afterward during her afternoon nap...",
            "Vision\tQilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty."

Though a peace treaty has been signed between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, I refuse to let my guard down. If conflict ever breaks out again, I will resume my place back on the front line.",
            "About Kujou Sara\tI have nothing good to say about the Shogun's Army, but Kujou Sara is perhaps the most honorable officer among their ranks. We've met each other countless times in battle, emerging both victorious and defeated at different times. *sigh* I know now that it's not realistic to think this way, but I did use to wonder what things would be like if those like her could value the wishes of the people and be free from the grip of the Shogunate.",
            "About Yae Miko\tOh, her... I'd prefer not to talk about her. Can we change the topic? Or, if there are any tasks I can take off your hand, I'll gladly oblige! Anything at all? ...Ahem, let's just say it'd be best for my general well-being if we can we avoid talking about her...",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tThe Yashiro Commission operates as part of the Shogunate, but on many issues they tend to side with the people of Inazuma. In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her.",
            "About Sayu\tHmm, according to our intel, she is a ninja proficient in the art of infiltration — a skill set which could prove very useful in some of Her Excellency's special operations... However, our intel also indicates that she could be difficult to recruit as she is rather unruly, and often disappears without a trace. Hmm? She's with the Yashiro Commission? Oh, well forget it then.",
            "About Shikanoin Heizou\tYou mean that sneaky detective that never seems to actually be working on a case? Well, no one from the Shogunate can be fully trusted, so I'll be keeping my eyes and ears on him! On a separate note, he does have some talent for investigation. But how can we know that this isn't all part of some nefarious scheme? Hmm. Only time will tell, I suppose.",
            "More About Gorou: I\tHmm, I'm afraid that most of my days have been spent on the battlefield, so there's not much to tell about me. But if you'd really like to hear my stories, I'm happy to sit down and tell you everything!",
            "More About Gorou: II\tI may not have superior cunning or intelligence, but what I do have is my own two hands and my life to lay on the line. Countless battles in, I'm still here, so I guess these hands and my will to survive were both strong enough to see me through. Some even say that no matter how dire the battle may be, everyone will emerge unscathed as long as they follow me. And with that, I've somehow gained enough reputation among our forces to become the leader that I am now.",
            "More About Gorou: III\tAt first, our only enemies were roaming bandits, pirates, and monsters. But then, everything changed when the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree. The Shogun's Army marched up expecting to put us in our place, but we were ready for them, and we hit them hard. Hehe, I bet they never expected to meet such fierce resistance.",
            "More About Gorou: IV\tHer Excellency once warned me of my fatal flaw... I tend to get too engrossed in battle, fighting deep into enemy lines and forgetting about everything else. She told me that my bravery is commendable, but as a ranking officer, it's not my place to do this. I'm doing my best to improve, but... Would you also be able to keep an eye on me?",
            "More About Gorou: V\tWe are not fighting against any particular group or faction. No, we fight against a destructive malice — a malice that has trampled the aspirations of the people and destroyed the peaceful lives they once knew. After I rid the land of such evil I will be able to peacefully lay down my weapon. Only then will I trade my uniform for civilian attire... and finally stroll the beautiful landscape of Watatsumi Island together with you.",
            "Gorou's Hobbies\tI love mountain climbing! The steeper, the better. Climbing trains my body and mind, making me stronger with every grip and every foothold. Better yet is climbing mountains with fellow companions. After hours of dirt and sweat scaling the summit, we can sit down and enjoy the view together. It's one of life's greatest joys! Ahem, however, I have absolutely no desire to scale the tallest peak in Inazuma...",
            "Gorou's Troubles\tThere are times when being lightly armored has its shortcomings... For example, I have to be particularly careful of my tail when the enemy attacks with fire.",
            "Favorite Food\tMy favorites are cake and Tricolor Dango, probably because I seldom get the chance to enjoy the luxury of sweets. The rations we have in the field are intended to be simple, effective, and quick, and are seldom served with any seasonings at all, let alone sugar... It's probably the most precious commodity of all. Ah, what can I say — I guess I just have a sweet tooth!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI'll pretty much eat anything, but onions are an exception. One time, the logistics division added ground onion to my food and I bawled in front of everyone, right there at the mess table... *sigh* Talk about embarrassing. The soldiers from logistics felt terrible about it, too.",

            "Birthday\tToday's a momentous occasion, your birthday! Allow me to arrange all the celebrations for you! We can make a bonfire on the beach and catch some fresh fish and crabs. I'll personally prepare a morale-boosting meal that would make even the highest-ranking generals jealous.",

            "Character Details\tGorou is the great general of Watatsumi Island's military, and he is deeply loved by his subordinates.\nDuring the period of the Vision Hunt Decree, Gorou led the forces of Watatsumi against the Shogun's Army, and successfully held the line against them.\nThe troops call him the \"ever-victorious pointy-eared general,\" a nickname that has also seen broad use among Shogunate warriors.\nIn private, however, Gorou puts on no airs and is a straightforward person, which has led him to be regarded by all as the man with the plan.\nBut even such an exemplary general must have his fair share of troubles...",
            "Character Story 1\tGorou was once an ordinary Watatsumi soldier.\nDuring a certain special operation, Gorou's unit, Gorgasia II, faced an unprecedented crisis.\nTheir captain had been felled by a stray arrow, and the survivors were surrounded deep in the mountains.\nTo continue their mission, to ask for reinforcements, to open negotiations with the enemy... Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.\nLeaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.\nAt this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.\nThey would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.\nWhen asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:\n\"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got.\"\n\"I'll take responsibility if the plan fails.\"\nAfter holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by Sangonomiya Kokomi herself.\nAfter that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General.",
            "Character Story 2\tIn the eyes of the men, Gorou is a strict but humble general.\nHe is straightforward and easy-going, and he treats his subordinates like his own family, sharing weal and woe with them.\nSangonomiya Kokomi once told Gorou that material, supplies, and salaries were the three most important things to an army.\nFrom that day on, he would personally explain weapon maintenance to his subordinates. Every time the granaries were opened, he would supervise the process strictly to prevent any unlawful deductions.\nAnd as General Gorou, he will always lead from the front.\nThe sight of him charging at the tip of the spear is like a rallying banner, encouraging the troops behind him to continue advancing.\nThese are all reasons why the troops greatly respect him. As with Kokomi, Gorou greatly treasures the lives of his troops, but by contrast, values his own quite little.\nSome who understand little of the thought process behind this occasionally joke that Gorou is a \"kid\" who doesn't seem like a general at all.\nBut to the soldiers of Watatsumi Island, this kid is the best general they could ask for.",
            "Character Story 3\tGorou is valiant and decisive, often leading inferior forces to victory over superior opposition.\nHowever, he does have a shortcoming of his own — a sometimes unstable temper.\nThat is to say that the blood sometimes rushes to his head at the height of a battle.\nWar is cruel, and Gorou does indeed lack experience compared to veterans who have been scrapping it out on battlefields for decades.\nFortunately, he learns fast and is currently trying to make up for his various small failings.\nSangonomiya Kokomi often provides her various commanders with directives, but how they are used is up to the skill of the commander in question.\nFor his part, Gorou is always able to execute the courses of action that best suit the present situation from the directives he has been given.\nGorou believes that over time, he will come to internalize the concepts behind them. Perhaps then, he can take the field with even more confidence than before.",
            "Character Story 4\tAt Yae Miko's request, Gorou has taken up a certain extra \"job\" at Yae Publishing House.\nWith the end of the Vision Hunt Decree, and the successful negotiations between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, relations between the two sides are beginning to warm.\nGorou has also visited Narukami Island quite a few times to check out the changes, buy a few popular books, and go to Yae Publishing House to complete the task he agreed to help with.\nYae Miko set up an anonymous column for Gorou in the \"That's Life\" magazine. Here, readers will write about the things that trouble them and send them to Yae Publishing House, upon which Gorou will give them some suggestions.\nYae Publishing House will take special care to redact any personal information revealed on the part of the write-ins or Gorou's replies, and will replace real names with pseudonyms.\nAccording to Yae Miko, she chose him because she'd heard that he often listened to his subordinates when they chatted about personal matters.\nThe column proved to be very popular indeed, but for whatever reason, every time an editor delivers the royalties to Gorou, they might sheepishly ask:\n\"Ah, speaking of which, Gorou, have you heard of Ms. Hina?\"\n\"I've heard that she's a rather popular columnist, and a recent one, too. Is something the matter?\"\n\"Oh, no, no... It's nothing...\"",
            "Character Story 5\tJust as the troops don't exactly tell Gorou everything happening in their lives, Gorou, too, has some troubles that are difficult to share.\nFor example, how his tail fur starts to get dull and look haggard after being exposed to the elements for too long, and how he'd love to tend to it — if he could only spare the time out in the field.\nOr how he sometimes feels a bit inferior about his slight physique when bathing together with his subordinates.\nOr about how encountering inscrutable women like Yae Miko sends him into defense mode instantly, rendering him unable to properly interact with them...\nIn trying to maintain a respectable image, Gorou refrains from telling his soldiers about such troubles.\nAnd while they have been able to guess at his troubles to some extent, the Watatsumi soldiers often just play along and pretend that they don't notice.\nAs such, his worries just kept piling up, until the Traveler arrived, thus granting the Watatsumi general, ever good at banishing the worries of others, someone who could help relieve him of his own woes.",
            "Mountaineering Gear\tOf Gorou's various hobbies, \"mountaineering\" is likely up there in the top three.\nSweating it out while climbing a mountain with companions before admiring the beauty all around you helps to train both the mind and body and is a great camaraderie-builder.\nTo better enjoy this hobby of his, Gorou bought a set of mountaineering gear from a traveling merchant.\nThe set is not particularly pricey, but it is both sturdy and durable and has seen Gorou through many dangerous ascents.\nJust as he maintains his weapons well, Gorou has also kept this set of gear in tip-top shape. There is little doubt that it will accompany him through many future journeys as well.",
            "Vision\tThere was a time when Gorou ascribed responsibility for victory or loss in battle entirely to himself.\n\"If only I became a little stronger, perhaps I'd be able to turn the tide.\"\nIt was in this spirit that Gorou trained his archery day and night, hoping to rely on his strength to lead his comrades to victory.\nBut after some time on the battlefield, Gorou saw powerful warriors being isolated and captured alive, while weak troops in inferior positions could rout their enemies through unity.\nThat was when Gorou realized that a single person's battlefield capabilities are limited.\nGetting stronger is important, naturally, but uniting the troops to fight as one is even more crucial.\nA troop can only be unbeatable if they are strong together.\nHaving realized this, Gorou no longer pursued the apex of excellence in archery, but instead invested time and effort in those around him, helping everyone improve together.\nThinking back on it, this may have opened the door for Gorou to obtain his Vision."

            "Character Story 1\tFuneral ceremonies allow mortals to leave this world with dignity.\nAnd Liyue's Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is said to be painting the last strokes on the scrolls of people's lives in the most respectful way.\nTraditional funerals include multiple steps such as holding a wake, burial, putting up a memorial plaque... All of which are subject to strict rules.\nRegardless of their social standing and level of wealth, all who depart deserve a ceremony that would do them honor. This is the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's client service philosophy.\nOne would think that such a reputable organization ought to be led only by an individual of utmost learning and sagacity.\nYet the heavy mantle of the 77th Director has fallen on the shoulders of a young lady like Hu Tao.\nShe has got quite a reputation in Liyue. Whenever someone mentions Hu Tao, their neighbors find it extremely hard to navigate the conversation.\nAlthough she is widely praised for her wit and shrewdness, her eccentric notions are not as welcome, as she often lets her imagination run wild.\nAs a three-year-old, she would read through volumes of classic texts while doing handstands. At six, she would cut classes and fall asleep in coffins. When she was eight, she started living in the parlor and learning the etiquette of funeral ceremonies...\nOne would never use the word \"measured\" to describe her behavior.\nDuring her teenage years, Hu Tao was tasked with conducting a funeral ceremony for the first time.\nThe parlor's undertakers and consultants were anticipating her debut with their stomachs in knots as if they were suspended over the peaks of Jueyun Karst.",
            "Character Story 2\tFortunately, Hu Tao treats the parlor's operations with the utmost importance and is always looking to grow her business.\n\"At the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, the living give us Mora to see the dead on their way. We have a responsibility to both parties, so we gotta make sure both sides are happy.\"\nWhen it comes to the parlor's rules, Hu Tao knows them all like the back of her hand.\nEach day when the parlor closes its doors, Hu Tao invites consultants from different walks of life to pass their teachings on to the undertakers.\n\"The funeral tradition is like science. It cannot be performed based on impressions and personal habits.\"\nOf all the lecturers, Zhongli is the most revered one. As such, his lessons have proven to be the most effective in cultivating the competence of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's undertakers.\nDespite often being teased by Hu Tao due to his old-fashioned style, he is also the person that she trusts the most.\nApart from that, Hu Tao always instructs her undertakers to respect their clients' wishes and not insist on any particular form of funeral.\n\"Some clients want nothing more than a peaceful ceremony, some opt for a more lively style of event. There are also wealthier clients who would request a funeral arrangement of the most pompous kind. The services we provide have to be tailor-made according to the clients' needs.\"\nEver since Hu Tao took over, the parlor's operations have been solid and reliable, with ceremonies conducted so tactfully that quite a few superstitious people in Liyue have changed their attitudes towards funerals.\nEven so, Hu Tao still has a tendency to wander off, disappearing as soon as her undertakers are busy listening to lectures.\nThe hobbies and interests of this young director are just as eccentric as her personality, and yet it is difficult to say with certainty if those activities are of a purely leisurely nature.\nHu Tao's shadow can be seen in the moonlit docks or at the highest, most precarious viewpoints in the mountains, where she's likely to take in the scenery and shape her thoughts into beautiful poetry.\nShe loves to roam freely at night, looking for inspiration. When it strikes her, no matter where she is, she cannot help but compose a poem on the spot.\nIf they are particularly lucky, the traveling merchants taking respite around the Huaguang Stone Forest can spot a mysterious girl keeping herself amused in solitude.\nHu Tao can play a four-player card game accompanied by no one for hours on end.\nThat said, the joys of engaging in such activities remain a mystery to all but Hu Tao herself.",
            "Character Story 3\tThe Ministry of Civil Affairs is guarded by two life-like stone lions, a symbol of power and authority.\nHowever, Hu Tao, who happened to be passing by the ministry building one day, saw them in a different light. At first, she examined the lions with a thoughtful look, but soon enough, her pensive face gave way to a wide smile, as she slapped them on the fore-paws.\nFrom that moment on, Hu Tao often visited and petted the stone statues. Not only would she talk to them, but also give them pet names — Whiskers for the one on the left and Mittens for the one on the right.\nOn occasion, she would even bring a bucket of water and a big brush to bathe them, each move so careful and deliberate that one might think that they were her actual pets.\nAs it happened, another feline, a living and breathing calico cat, could be found enjoying the local delicacies in front of Xinyue Kiosk, not too far from the ministry building. One day, some city folk came to play with the restaurant's favorite, providing an interesting foil for Hu Tao's peculiarities. Met with befuddled gazes of the bystanders, Hu Tao showed unwavering confidence.\n\"Sure, your kitty's cute, but the same can be said about my Whiskers and Mittens. Their fur might be harder, but they're still just as fluffy! Any animal that brings people joy may become a pet. And when it comes to majestic looks, your little fur-ball simply can't measure up to my lions!\"\nSuffice to say that this explanation was met with even greater consternation from the onlookers.\nYet the group of people shocked the most and most often by Hu Tao's antics were the ministry guards. Soft footsteps could often be heard in front of the building at around midnight. Initially, the guards suspected that it had been a thief preparing to rob officials. To their unceasing surprise, it would turn out to just be a young lady playing with the stone lions.\nThe guards were faced with an even bigger conundrum when, once everyone had reluctantly got used to her presence, Hu Tao discontinued her visits.\nThat meant that the responsibility for cleaning the statues fell on the guards' shoulders once again.\nSubsequently, they decided to keep guard by the lions for many days, anticipating Hu Tao's return. Once they finally had the opportunity to ask her why she would not visit anymore, they received the most absurd of answers.\n\"Whiskers and Mittens are adults now and can take care of themselves! Excuse me, I'm running late for my heart-to-heart with a Statue of the Seven regarding the meaning of life!\"",
            "Character Story 4\tNot long after her initial meeting with the little zombie, Hu Tao decided that, as her self-proclaimed true friend, she should grant Qiqi eternal peace.\nHu Tao would go on to kidnap Qiqi several times following much deliberation in every instance, including calculating the most auspicious time for the ceremony, aiming to follow the standard procedure of cremation, after which she would place Qiqi in a tomb on the outskirts of the city.\nIn fact, she would have succeeded already if not for Baizhu's timely interventions.\nEach time the Bubu Pharmacy's owner managed to catch up with them, Hu Tao had already had Qiqi packed in a bag, with only her head sticking out, staring in utter confusion as Hu Tao was vigorously digging a hole for the pyre.\nAfterwards, Hu Tao sent Qiqi an apology letter, in which she expressed deep regret that she had not been able to lay Qiqi to rest fast enough.\nIn Hu Tao's eyes, Qiqi passed away a long time ago, but has been trapped in this world and cannot free herself of her eternal suffering.\nBaizhu, for his part, had grown ever more relentless in his pursuit of eternal life after meeting Qiqi. This act of defiance against the cycle of life and death was unacceptable to Hu Tao.\nShe wanted to bury Qiqi not only out of consideration for her friend but also to restore the natural order.\nBut Qiqi could not disagree more, as she was afraid of death and disliked Hu Tao for her attempts.\nBecause the struggle between Hu Tao and her had been going on for so long, Qiqi has experienced a breakthrough. She has started to remember places where she might hide to avoid being captured by Hu Tao.\nPerhaps it was due to those desperate survival efforts that Hu Tao decided to do something unusual and dig deeper into Qiqi's past.\nThe story of her accident and the mystery of the adepti... That series of coincidences filled Hu Tao's heart with hesitation.\nSince Qiqi's will to live is so strong, she should not be forced to move on. Given the circumstances, she could only be treated as a rare exception that eludes the natural laws.\nEver since, Hu Tao's attitude towards Qiqi has changed drastically, to the point that she would pamper her.\nUnfortunately, the damage has been done and Hu Tao has become Qiqi's bugbear. The little zombie may need several years more to let go of her grievances.",
            "Character Story 5\tHu Tao is not, in fact, best known for her role as Director, but for her other great accomplishment: the creation of poetry.\nShe dubs herself the \"versemonger of the darkest alleys,\" and free verse flows forth untamed from her mouth whenever she has free time to be out on the streets.\nThe \"Hilitune\" is Hu Tao's most famous work, well-loved not only by the people of the harbor, but ever on the lips of children as far as Qingce Village as well.\nHobbyists and critics alike were greatly surprised by the simple but profound originality of the \"Hilitune\" and its creation, and went to Wanwen Bookhouse in droves to search for the works of this great poet. Unfortunately, Hu Tao's anthologies, named \"Fiddlesticks\" and \"Of Common Lives\" respectively, have yet to be published.\nXingqiu, ever immersed in books, also wanted to meet this strange person, and so chose an auspicious date to visit, bringing a gift with him.\nThe two hit it off immediately, and they exchanged pointers and impromptu poetry in Wangsheng's main hall — and when faced with the poetry of Xingqiu's traditional, artistic bent, Hu Tao could always return in kind with some strange and marvelous verse.\nAnd there was meaning in the chaos, indeed, a rhythm to the bizarre that anyone could perceive, and it was catchy, too.\nThus did she \"beat the old master with untrained fists,\" leaving Xingqiu at a loss for words.\nAt length, the poetic spar ended amiably, and they have been friends ever since, reading and composing poetry with one another when they have the time to meet.\nOver time, Chongyun, too, was pulled in to serve as an umpire, their laughter filling the streets.\nThe poems born from these sessions would also be recorded by bystanders.\nIf ever you should hear a pair of matched verses, one strict and the other playful, you are most likely to have heard one created jointly by Hu Tao and Xingqiu.",
            "Harmony Hexagram Hat\tThis hat is somewhat on the hard side, and the insignia of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor adorns its front.\nIt is said that this hat was passed from the 75th Director to Hu Tao. However, that director was large, musclebound, and had a head at least two sizes larger than hers.\nUltimately, Hu Tao had to spend an entire day and night to modify the hat with her own hands such that its dimensions would fit hers. When she meets others, she tells them: this hat is magical, upholding good and repelling evil, and is a bringer of peace!\nThe undertakers laugh and leave it at that, but the 77th Director clearly does treasure that hat.\nNo matter the rain or storm, or if Hu Tao returns late covered in muck, that hat will remain spotless and clean.\nThe plum blossom that adorns the side of the hat is plucked from a plum tree that Hu Tao planted and grew herself.\nIts creation process is as follows: pluck and air-dry, then paint, lacquer, and outline carefully before sun-drying for three days and voila — a beautiful accessory, soft to the touch and bearing a delicate fragrance.",
            "Vision\tThis tale should begin with the funeral of Hu Tao's grandfather.\nTen days before the funeral itself, Old Hu had passed away following a bout of illness. For its 75th Director, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor held a grand funeral, in accordance with the last wishes of the old man himself, to be conducted by Hu Tao.\nOnly thirteen at the time, Hu Tao, who would later go on to become the Director in turn, made all the arrangements herself to the highest standard, greatly impressing the undertakers.\nAfter the funeral, the thirteen-year-old Hu Tao grabbed her traveler's bag and crept out alone in the dead of night. In her bag were only a few rations, some water, and a means to create some light. She was headed to a mysterious and seldom-seen frontier.\nHeading straight from Wuwang Hill, one may arrive at the \"border.\" It is the line that separates life and death, the secrets of which have been managed by Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for generations. According to legend, it is a place where the souls of past relatives and the spirits of those with unfulfilled aspirations linger. For Hu Tao, this journey was a chance to see her grandfather once more before he departed forever.\nFor two days she journeyed unceasingly before finally arriving at her destination, yet was unable to locate her grandfather upon arrival. Between the innumerable spirits she walked, but not one of them resembled the old man.\nShe stayed there the whole day before falling asleep in exhaustion, awakening to a night sky and heavy dew. Around her were gathered a few lone spirits, clapping and laughing:\n\"Silly girl, why would Old Hu be here of all places? What were you thinking, looking for your relatives here?\"\nNot one to be swayed so easily, Hu Tao continued to wait, day after day. Her rations gradually disappeared and her water supplies drained away, but her grandfather did not appear. In the end, it was a little old woman who came to her.\nShe laid eyes on the exhausted Hu Tao and smiled as she spoke: \"Look at your stubbornness, you're exactly like Old Hu. It's a shame, but none of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Directors would ever linger here. You come from a family of plain speakers, so let me return the favor... Go back. Go back to where you came from.\"\nThe old woman bid farewell to Hu Tao, before passing over the border and into the distance. Hu Tao watched as the figure of the mysterious woman grew smaller and disappeared, as a sense of doubt tinged with relief manifested itself.\nAt last she came to the conclusion: her grandfather's absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he'd arrived, to the place where he was bound. He had been open and honest in life, leaving behind no regrets, so was it right for his departure to be framed in regretful terms?\nWith a smile, she set forth on the return journey.\nThe faraway moon had been casting a thin light on the way over but had now been replaced by the bright light of dawn. As she walked, Hu Tao thought of a saying that her grandfather had often quoted: \"Live in life, die in death. Follow your heart, do what you can.\"\nIt was noon when Hu Tao arrived home. She climbed over the wall into the rear courtyard, went straight to her room, and unpacked her travel bag.\nWith her food and water long gone, and the rest of her belongings unpacked, the bag she had taken for empty instead contained a colorful Vision. Just when had it arrived?\nAs one of the few living that had dared to visit the border, perhaps Hu Tao's actions had moved some unknown god.\nPerhaps this then constituted a heavenly gift... the ultimate recognition of her strength."

            "Character Story 1\tThe Gunnhildr Clan is the oldest family of knights in Mondstadt, dating back to even before the very first epic was written.\nHowever, this long and proud lineage can also be a burden. Jean was raised by her mother to be the successor to the Gunnhildr Clan.\nShe was trained in all the things a knight must know and all the qualities they must exhibit, from discipline, etiquette and conduct, to knowledge of history and ballads, as well as maintaining peak swordsmanship and physical fitness. Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: \"For Mondstadt, as always.\"\nSome time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say \"For Mondstadt, as always\" before learning to say \"Mommy.\"\nAs a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, \"Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection,\" and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.\nNow, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto.\n\"You have to give your all to do the right thing. Always.\"",

She'll know what to do.\"\nThe denizens of Mondstadt, civilians and knights alike, all rely on Jean.\nIf someone needs help for the right reasons, Jean does not hesitate to render assistance.\nBe it a quarrel down at the market, a relationship issue...\nNo matter how unrelated it may be to a knight's job... Jean gladly lends a hand whenever she can.\n\"The chance to help someone in need is reason enough for a knight.\"\nTo her, her knightly duty takes priority over her role as Acting Grand Master. She believes helping others herself is the best way to assist.\nShe holds her fellow knights to the same standard.\nLisa the Librarian once suggested that Jean take a break and \"enjoy some afternoon tea, as is befitting of a lady.\"\nHowever, to Jean, doing that which is befitting of a knight takes priority over doing that which is befitting of a lady.\n\"Jean is so reliable.\"\nSuch is the reputation Jean enjoys in Mondstadt.\nHer only gripe is that there are not enough hours in the day. She could never help all of those in need, even by forgoing sleep.\nThe dedication and commitment required to become someone so reliable is unimaginable.",

Her role and title within the Knights of Favonius do not affect her work ethic in the slightest.\nHer passion, honesty, and meticulousness come from two things.\nOne is her education and training, which instilled in her a chivalrous spirit from a young age.\nThe other is the devoted teachings of Varka, the free-spirited Knight of Boreas and Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, currently dispatched on a crusade.\nThe effect the relaxed and unruly Knight of Boreas Varka has had on Jean's growth has been great.\n\"Grand Master, please take your job seriously. All of Mondstadt looks up to you.\"\n\"Well, you are my second-in-command, so helping me out is part of your job description. This way, I can focus on the really important things, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\"...\"\nHe is the knight of new frontiers and legendary conquests, while she is the knight of maintaining peace and freedom.\nJean does not resent Varka; perhaps there is wisdom in his conduct. However, what Varka leaves undone falls on her shoulders, and it is then down to her to do the right thing.\nHalf a year ago, Varka led the elite knights of Favonius on yet another expedition away from Mondstadt.\nAn expedition — how typical of Varka's character.\n\"I'll leave things here to you. I mean, you've basically been doing my job for years now, anyway.\"\n\"Leave it to me, Grand Master.\"\nAfter seeing the Grand Master off, Jean sat by the window and thought to herself:\nUpon your return, I will show you a kinder, more prosperous, and more peaceful Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe great tree at Windrise is where the first Dandelion Knight came to the end of her journey.\nShe was Vennessa, the founder of the Knights of Favonius and the restorer of Mondstadt.\nShe bade farewell to the city she had vowed to protect, leaving behind her legend and a single sapling.\nAfter centuries of basking in the bliss of the thousand winds, this sapling grew into a towering tree.\nJean was conferred the title of \"Dandelion Knight\" at the age of fifteen.\nThe Dandelion Knight is also known as Lionfang Knight. Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.\nOn the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.\nThe title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?\nMore than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?\nBeneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.\nThe wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:\nFor Mondstadt, as always.\nTo become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.\nTo this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.\nThe great tree at Windrise marked the end of the first Lionfang Knight's journey.\nSo too does it symbolize the beginning of Jean's.",
            "Character Story 5\tMaster Jean has a secret.\nThe Gunnhildr Clan is a venerable knightly house. This prideful blood comes from Jean's mother, Frederica.\nJean's father on the other hand is Seamus Pegg, an adventurer famed throughout the continent. When he came to Mondstadt, he dusted off his past self and started anew with the Church of Favonius, and ascended to high office within it, becoming known as the Cardinal of Daybreak.\nThe two lovers eventually parted ways. Young Jean, holding her mother's hand, would watch the silhouettes of her father and her sister, Barbara, grow ever more distant.\nLater, Barbara would follow in her father's footsteps and join the Church of Favonius, becoming a deaconess much beloved by the people.\nJean has always wanted to get closer to her younger sister by blood, but cannot bring herself to say anything when faced with Barbara's evasive eyes.\nPerhaps this all-too-similar awkwardness is a sign that the sentiment is shared.\nMaster Jean has yet another secret.\nNo matter how many times she has read the historical classics, despite her title of Dandelion Knight, and though she has become the Acting Grand Master whom everyone relies on...\nJean still loves romance novels.\nThis is not for the years as a young girl that she missed amid her training and duties, or due to the rift that formed in her parents' marriage.\nJean simply yearns for the mutual attraction spoken of in such stories, for those emotions as subtle and fragile as spider-silk.\nAs a knight, she must put Mondstadt and the Knights of Favonius first.\nBut...\n\"If I too could...\"\nIn her office, deep at night, Jean once again finishes reading \"Vera's Melancholy.\"\n\"If I have the time, it should be fine to go to Cape Oath, just before daybreak... right?\"\nLowering her head, Jean peeks out her window at the glittering stars above.",
            "Jean's Daily Schedule - Ver. XVII\tThis schedule is accurate down to the minute.\nFrom a morning run with Amber followed a breakfast trip with Lisa on the way, to doing her own laundry by hand and settling her own change of clothes at night — all things great and small pack Jean's schedule rather tightly.\nEvery completed item is ticked off, while ones delayed due to external factors list the detailed whys and wherefores.\nNext to the item \"Mondstadt Public Facilities Review\" — delayed due to a bout of illness — is written the following \"completed at 3 am, end-of-month book purchase award is canceled.\"\nJean sometimes thinks that inspiration for this schedule may have been the training program her mother drew up for her ten years ago.",
            "Vision\tIf one were to go by skill alone, Jean has long become one of the best swordsmen in Mondstadt.\nBut in Jean's heart, she would rather be a shield that defends freedom and song than a sword that cuts through corruption and darkness.\n\"Protecting\" has always been a tougher task than \"destroying.\"\nAround the time when she was promoted from Captain of her squad to Master of the Knights, a huge challenge stood before her. From without, the Fatui exerted diplomatic pressure, and from within, there were traitors — comrades of the former Inspector. Regrouping and finding a way to break through was no easy task.\nBut Jean was able to fend off the external pressure with one hand, and lead the Knights to smash the many plots of the Abyss Order with the other, re-establishing the authority of the Knights of Favonius.\nJean will never forget the moment she received her Vision. At that moment, all seemed to grow quiet as she felt the breeze flow through her hand. The world seemed to fade away, save for the time-honored motto of the house of Gunnhildr:\n\"For Mondstadt, as always.\""

            "Character Details\tJust like the other progeny of the Children of Echoes, Kachina grew up surrounded by adorable Tepetlisaurs, spending her time digging shiny gems out of the bowels of the mountains and listening to her elders passing down the legends of heroes.\nShe learned the mountain paths like the back of her hand, developing a great instinct and talent for finding minerals buried deep beneath the ground. When she had some time to kill, she'd be with all the other kids, running off to the music studios where artists were recording their newest tunes to just cut loose and dance freely to the pulsing rhythms.\nGrowing up in this environment, the occasional bump and scratch was unavoidable, and Kachina would cry out in pain when she hurt herself, just like any other child. But long before any other kid would have recovered, Kachina would have wiped away her tears and stood back up again.\nIn the eyes of others, of course she was a good kid. But Kachina still struggled to understand why someone as ordinary as herself was given the Ancient Name \"Uthabiti.\"\nJust what part of her was worthy of the ideals of strength this great name carried? Young as she was, she was unable to puzzle it out.\nBut having been granted this great honor, she had an obligation to participate in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. Moreover, returning triumphantly from the Pilgrimage and rising up like the heroes of legend was the dream of every warrior of Natlan — including Kachina.\nAs she experienced failure time and time again, not only was she overwhelmed with sadness, but she couldn't even lift her head to face the disappointed looks in the faces of her friends. Nevertheless, she would wipe away her tears, and stand up once more.\nBut having already failed so many times, could she really achieve success in the Pilgrimage? Kachina, who always gave everything she had, to fight on, felt doubt creeping into her heart.",
            "Character Story 1\tOther than the required applicant information on the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame pre-registration form, there is also a page for providing optional information about the candidate. The information it asks for includes, but is not limited to, hobbies, personal experiences, and so on. The original purpose was to make it easy for the promotional team to create materials to hype up participants, but practically everyone already knew all the info on the hottest contestants, so trying to find out that way was completely unnecessary. And so, over time, nobody took the supplemental form seriously. It seems like only Kachina would carefully fill in every blank on the supplemental form every time.\n\"Hobbies: Dancing.\"\nEvery member of the Children of Echoes knows a thing or two about dancing, and a stereotype the other tribes have about the Children is that dancing is in their blood. The moment music sounds, the children of the Nanatzcayan will start subconsciously swaying. But even among them, Kachina is a gifted dancer, with great control over her body even from a young age. Her movements as she shifts her weight to the beat have always been as smooth as a swimming Koholasaurus. Even Pochtli frequently praised her, and Pochtli is not someone given to giving out compliments. Actually, Kachina really wanted to write that down too, to prove she did have something to write about, but since she was worried it would look conceited, she let it go.\nAs for her other hobby, she hesitated for a long time before finally deciding not to put it to paper.\nDigging.\nWhat she found embarrassing was that, like most members of the Children of Echoes, her favorite thing to do was dig around in tunnels. Whenever she discovered a vein of ore in a dark tunnel, a warm feeling would well up in her heart. Everyone in the Children of Echoes understood this warmth, but she thought writing \"digging up minerals\" in the \"hobbies\" section would only make it look like she lacked personality.\n\"I really don't have any strengths.\" She wanted to sigh.\nThe next box was about the people closest to you.\n\"Dad, Mom, Ayo...\" She began to fill in her family's names.\nOther than her parents, who gave her so much love and warmth, the one closest to her was her Tepetlisaurus companion, Ayo. The one by her side the first time she tried digging alone was none other than Ayo. When her parents were recounting the legendary tales to her, and when she was out causing a ruckus, the one following close behind her was always Ayo. Just thinking of him, Kachina couldn't help but smile.\nShe wanted to add a few other names between the lines, like Mualani, who always encouraged her with a smile, and Kinich, who always extended a helping hand when she needed it most, and from her own tribe, Uncle Pacal... But she couldn't fit that many names in the space provided, so, she had to let them go.\nWhen she finally finished filling it all in, and handed the supplementary form to the staff member on duty, they were absolutely flabbergasted that this pocket-sized little girl had actually filled out the entire form.\n\"That page is optional, you know. It's okay if you don't write anything down,\" they joked.\nHer response was: \"That's fine. Everything I can do well, I want to take seriously.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tTepetlisaurs and the Children of Echoes have been living together since before the time of Kachina's grandfather's grandfather. It is the custom of the people to work and live alongside them, and become companions.\nThis means that for the Children of Echoes, Saurians are not like the livestock whose lives and deaths are dictated by humans, nor are they like pets, beholden to the whims of their masters. They stand as equals to humanity.\nMost bonds between Tepetlisaurs and humans are formed willingly, just like Kachina and Ayo.\nTepetlisaurus nests are never too far from Children of Echoes dwellings, and this proximity ensures Saurian and human are often running into one another, with the latter considering the former to be friendly neighbors, never thinking it odd to meet one occasionally.\nFor a time when Kachina was quite young, she'd often run into a robust young Tepetlisaur at the crossroads on the way to the mines. To Kachina, these simple, honest neighbors were a group worth greeting, so she'd always say \"Hi!\" to him.\nAfter a time, it seemed like the little Tepetlisaur remembered her, and she began running into him more and more different places. Practicing dancing in an open field, gathering grainfruit, catching fish in the river... After so many encounters, the young Saurian and human would not only greet one another, but also sometimes exchange gifts.\nWinning the little Saurian's friendship wasn't a complicated affair. Kachina didn't need to worry about trying to prove her worth to him, or offering him special rewards. They simply felt comfortable hanging out together, so they spent time together.\nUntil one day, the little Tepetlisaur just naturally followed Kachina to her home, after which it became her family's companion, and Kachina gave him the name \"Ayo.\" The whole thing was totally normal, no less natural than how fish must swim in water or how birds must soar through the skies.\nFrom then on, Ayo always showed her the loyalty and affection he shows to friends, unlike some of the playmates she grew up with. They didn't hesitate to start keeping their distance after she failed time and time again in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, and some even mocked and ridiculed her. But Ayo has always stood firmly by her side with his sharp horn, never wavering.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"Uthabiti\" carries the meaning of toughness and tenacity. At first, Kachina did not think that she was at all worthy of such an Ancient Name, brimming with honor.\nAfter consulting the ancient woven scrolls, and learning just what kind of people the ancient heroes who had borne the name before were, she felt even more perplexed.\nThey all possessed incredible power, and would always remain bold and spirited, no matter what dangers they faced, for which they were revered by later generations; they had maintained their noble character despite enduring the harshest of conditions, protecting their homelands with naught but their own strength, never wavering in their duties or abandoning their responsibilities until their last breath. Looking back at herself, she felt she didn't have the strength of warriors of the Collective of Plenty, nor did she possess the agility of the Riders of the Flower-Feather Clan. Even though she didn't want to appear weak and easily bullied, in the face of constantly being belittled and even degraded, she couldn't help but cry and snuffle.\n\"Do tough people really cry all the time like I do?\"\nShe really was a long, long way from being anything close to \"tough.\" After reaching this conclusion, she was despondent for some time, drowning in despair. But she quickly let go of those feelings. Not because she trained until she became a powerful warrior, or because she suddenly understood some profound truth. And though her friends and family did show her a lot of care and concern, her choice was mostly dictated by her own habits.\nNo matter how badly you fall, the first thing you have to do is just get back up again.\nWhen she was even younger, every time she fell, she would already have stood up when any other child would still have been wailing on the ground. Yes, the wounds still hurt, and her tears were still splashing to the ground, but these were just innate physical reactions. She consciously felt she should stand up and look at the rock that had tripped her before carrying on crying.\nAnd the same is true now. Facing with a future without much hope, she felt intense fear, and was frustrated and lost. Being so young, she didn't yet understand how to conceal her own feelings, and so she wore her negative thoughts and emotions on her sleeve. But she would still stand up once more, sobbing and sniffling, her face painted by her tears and bruises, and keep practicing, keep pushing forward.\nShe herself understood this as being able to take a beating, but in the words of Uncle Pacal, who was both more mature and more eloquent:\n\"Though people are weak, their it is through their bravery in facing this cruel world that their greatness is truly revealed.\"\nMaybe Kachina really is tough.",
            "Character Story 4\tAfter returning from the Night Kingdom, it was as if the other households of the tribe looked upon Kachina's family in a new light.\nSome who had never spoken to her family before began to take the initiative, greeting them when they ran into them. Those acquaintances that before had only ever politely offered some small talk when they met now actively sought them out to socialize.\nWhether or not Kachina was there, the conversation would — intentionally or otherwise — invariably turn to her. They would laud her bravery and toughness, praising her from the tip of Ayo's tail to the points of her ears. In fact, those rather distinctive ears, which had once only been seen as a common \"atavistic trait,\" now became proof of her having been special from birth.\nHaving experienced so many setbacks, yet in the end finally returning triumphant, she was the epitome of persistence and perseverance against the odds. All her previous failures and defeats became little more than footnotes to her feat, buried amongst the paeans.\nSomething felt off to Kachina. Her mistakes and tears were being ignored by everyone, even though they plainly existed, concealed by the light of her success.\nOthers could forget about all the countless failures she had endured, but she herself could not, nor did she think she should.\nShe always thought she simply couldn't compare to those heroes who were victorious time and time again, and her triumphant return this time was intrinsically linked to the support of her friends. There was no way she could suddenly become the idealized version of herself who existed only in the praise streaming forth from others.\nShe was still the Kachina who couldn't stop herself from crying when dispirited, and she still wanted to be that Kachina who would always charge forward, getting back up again no matter how many times she falls.\n\"Not getting knocked down is definitely one type of tough, but maybe not losing yourself in all the flowers and praise is another.\"\nAnd so, Kachina added another footnote to her understanding of the name \"Uthabiti.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tEvery child of the Nanatzcayan has heard fables about raw ore and gems, and Kachina's parents related one such tale to her before bed.\nBefore the raw ore had been unearthed by the Children of Echoes, it had slept soundly in the depths below the mountains, alongside mud in its matrix.\nAt first, it didn't know it had the potential to become a gem. It only endured the long dark and loneliness, and never called itself as such.\n\"I'm just a chunk of totally ordinary rock.\" That's what it thought.\nUntil a great gale had blown away the topsoil, the raging rivers had washed away the silt, an earthquake had sundered the strata, and finally, the drills of the Children of Echoes split it off from its place in the bowels of the mountain... Even then, it still hadn't realized it had a certain splendorous radiance glittering within its own rocky heart.\nAs it was smashed and polished, the ore felt immense pain. As chisel and grindstone carried away many of its parts, and its ordinary rind was carved off, the patterns that represented its timidity were smoothed away. In the eyes of the Children of Echoes, this was a process filled with joy and beauty, but the ore knew not what was happening, or what would come next. As its tears flowed, it asked the chisel and grindstone:\n\"Why must this happen to me?\"\nTo reveal your true nature as a gem.\nBut those words remained unsaid. Unlike the ore, the chisel and grindstone had participated in the cutting of countless gems and witnessed the moment when the rays of light burst forth, and so they kept their silence.\nUntil the work was complete at last, and the ore could finally see what it looked like in the eyes of others: a beautiful gemstone.\nAs she walked alone through the Night Kingdom, Kachina kept thinking of this story. She remembered that she had asked her parents: What happened next? What should a gemstone look like? But the chill of the Night Kingdom blurred her memories, and she couldn't remember the rest of the fable. Fortunately, the memories of being with her parents gave her warmth, allowing the fire of her soul to burn on. She decided to stop soul-searching, for whether she was low-quality ore shattered by the chisel or a gem that yet held hope, she had to continue onward. She had many more things she wished to do, and many people she wished to see again.\nAt the moment she was bathed in sunlight once more, and saw the outstretched hand of the Traveler, she knew what a gemstone should look like:\nA strong, sturdy structure, capable of holding up the world even in the darkest hour.\nPossessing unquenchable hope, lighting up the pitch-black world.\nNow, she has returned triumphant from the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame and proven herself. The day when others gaze at her with admiration has finally come, and she can bring them faith and courage. The Pyro Archon herself told her, the name Kachina will be woven into the banners by the Masters of the Night-Wind, as a part Natlan's heroic saga, flowing into the Ley Lines, becoming an eternal legend.\nThus did tears and courage finally smelt the gemstone named \"Kachina.\"",
            "The Banner of Uthabiti\tWe recite the names of the ancestors, we sing the names of the heroes.\nThe brave warriors who inherit the name of \"Uthabiti,\" we record and weave their words.\nThe first strand of golden thread we offer to the sword-wielder who first created the name, a homely girl no taller than a child.\nShe once held back the collapse of the cliffs with her own two hands, bearing the people of an entire tribe upon her shoulders.\nIn spirit and in thought, she was many times greater than the tallest and sturdiest warriors in the entire history of Natlan.\nThe bright fire of this hero's life burned out quickly, yet even at death's door, she laughed freely and uproariously, the lingering sounds clear and bright, like a great river breaching a dike.\nThough her breath ceased and her heartbeat stilled, the weavers could still hear the sound of waves pouring forth from her shriveled body, only fading after seven nights.\nThe second strand of golden thread we offer to the shield-bearer who lifted the name from the river of concepts once more, he who never once put down his shield.\nThough he himself was slim as a reed, he stood and fought together with his shield for years after year, and never wavered no matter how time passed.\nHis body was as silent as his shield, but his soul was wont to bellow over the battlefield.\nEven within his urn, his ashes still attempted to solidify and burst through the vessel, leading all to declare he could not fit into such a small tomb.\nFinally, his remains were scattered amongst the mountains, the glittering ashen gravel echoing like thunder as it struck the stone walls.\nThe third strand of golden thread we offer to the anonymous ones lost between the layered banners, whose deeds have been hidden by history.\nWere it not for the Wayob's revelations, it would be difficult for us to clearly see the traces of the blood and tears they left behind.\nThe final moments of the great heroes were peaceful, and we offer our sincerest prayers that they burned themselves out in happiness and contentment.\nThe fourth strand of thread is woven with Saurian feathersilk, and we offer it to the spear-wielder who held the name high above the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame once more.\nIn the Night Kingdom, she traveled with the souls of the warriors who battle eternally, traversing the creeping dark and returning in triumph.\nTears do not lessen the glory of the name \"Uthabiti,\" and her return was inseparably linked to the start of a new age.\nWe recite the names of the ancestors, we sing the names of the heroes—\n\"The one that dares stand firm as a mountain, their bones like battlements, and hold the sun's gaze — it is they that shall be given unto eternity.\"\n\"Fear itself should instead fear me, for my body is like a roaring blaze; destined to melt down all that is mean and lowly, then cast it once more as an epitaph.\"",
            "Vision\tIt was after her first Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. Kachina's first Pilgrimage had ended in failure, all the lofty expectations from before having come to nothing. Everyone around her doubted her ability, but more painful still was that she began to find it harder to control her doubts about herself.\nMaybe even the Wayob occasionally got it wrong? Could she really \"melt down all that is mean and lowly\" like in the poem? Or maybe she was actually the kind of mediocre child who should be melted?\nIt was then that she rediscovered what digging meant to her.\nShe had always loved drilling to the depths of the mountains, seeking out treasures, but this time, she didn't dig with any kind of particular goal. She just carried her drill and bored forward, as though as long as she just kept going, disappointment and sorrow would be unable to bore a hole into her heart, but instead became the drill in her hand, punching a hole into the heart of the mountain.\nShe felt much happier moving forward endlessly through the darkness, where she might still turn up something good, rather than just enduring doubt and defeat. But in the world aboveground, that Pilgrimage would not be erased, and her defeat would march forward alongside time, a stamp Kachina could never rub away. Whether hiding down in the darkness, or standing upright in the sunlight, she was still completely dejected, and if she had to choose, the former was harder to bear. Because there, the word \"failure\" constantly echoed in her head, and it was far more painful for her than any of the tears and sweat she had shed in her training for the Pilgrimage.\nThe people of Natlan have a saying, that the Children of Echoes are a stubborn lot, and their lives are like the horns on a Tepetlisaur's head, soft yet sharp, and always charging forward. And much like the saying implies, stopping was never an option in Kachina's mind. All she knew was moving onward.\nPerhaps the heavens had decreed she could never become a towering hero, so all she could do was trudge on forward, shifting and testing and trying to take one step, then another.\nOf course, what she didn't understand then is that while thrusting out your chest, holding your head high, and shouting your certainty of victory while charging forward is certainly something people aspire to, setting your jaw, gritting your teeth, and inching forward, bit by bit, one leaden step at a time, is also something truly awesome.\nWhile underground, that was precisely what she was pondering.\nBut at the same time, she would also occasionally dig something interesting up.\nLike her Vision.\nWhen she received a Vision of her own, she was naturally quite happy, but she had already experienced a similar feeling of excitement before, and that was when she had received the Ancient Name \"Uthabiti.\"\nNeither the acknowledgment of an Archon nor of the Wayob meant that she would definitely accomplish some great deed, she had learned at least that much from reality, but what she hadn't learned was:\nWhen the legends of heroes are in their embryonic state, they aren't the least bit noteworthy, nor are the tales very encouraging, being dark and gloomy instead. But all the initial motivation they need to achieve greatness is already present, and as long as the protagonists keep on moving forward, the future will shine brightly for them.\nBut those in the stories can never know the ending beforehand, so as they run forward with everything they have, come what may, the tears they shed are all the more beautiful."

            "When It Rains\tTaking a stroll in the middle of a downpour certainly rouses the spirit... but it's best to dry your clothes as soon as possible after the rain stops.",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tCompared to the storms I've encountered out at sea, this is really quite tame.",
            "When It Snows\tI love it when it snows. The world falls completely silent... and I can sleep undisturbed.",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tClear weather all around brightens the heart.",
            "Good Morning\tThe birdsong at daybreak is nature's gift to us. Let us go. Our journey begins anew.",

            "Good Night\tThe wind has ceased... The world is silent, so now is the best time to rest well. See you tomorrow.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: Sailing\tIn truth, not every night out at sea is filled with wind and waves. When the weather is clear, the moonlight flows over the rippling water, and schools of fish circle the ship's hull. At moments like that, when I look out into the distance from the prow, I feel like this journey is worth it... The only thing that takes away from that feeling is the sailors' singing. They're so loud... don't they need to sleep?",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: Samurai Nobility\tThe Kaedehara Clan was once a famed samurai clan. It's a pity that by the time the noble name passed to me, the title itself was all that was left. But it is enough for me. A samurai has no need of a lavish life — we find all that we need in wine, song, and the blade in our hands.",

            "About the Vision\tAs I see it, a Vision is the proof of one's strength, not the source of it. It symbolizes the mortal desire to always keep moving forward, but in this endeavor, we samurai place our faith in our blades alone.",
            "Something to Share: Bamboo Blades\tAh, you'd like to learn the art of the sword? Let me see... Alright — here, take this. It's a bamboo blade I just made. With these, we can practice sparring without having to worry about getting injured.",

He's the type of person who says whatever's on his mind. He shares the highs and lows of his subordinates, and is never afraid to draw his sword for the sake of a friend. That's the kind of person I can really get along with.",
            "About Kujou Sara\tShe defeated my friend in a duel before the throne, which I accept as proof of her great strength. But she uses that strength to serve as an oppressor's lackey, leading the Kujou Clan's troops to relentlessly seek out and confiscate Visions. This... I cannot forgive.",

            "About the Raiden Shogun\tI've asked myself this question many times since leaving Inazuma. Do I simply resent the Raiden Shogun because of what happened in that duel? Because of the lethal stroke she dealt my dear friend? I've thought about this a good long time, and I believe the answer is no. My friend died an honorable death in that duel, and the Shogun was not unjustified in her conduct. My dissatisfaction with her has its roots in the Vision Hunt Decree. No one has the right to rob another of their hopes and dreams — not even a god.",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tI'm sure everyone living in Inazuma has heard of the \"Shirasagi Himegimi.\" The lady of the Kamisato Clan is as perfect as a person can be, though our paths have seldom crossed. I wonder what she thinks of the state of Inazuma today?",
            "About Yoimiya\tThe last time she commissioned Captain Beidou to ship fireworks to Liyue, I unloaded the shipment myself. They were so heavy! I doubt that anyone besides her could make such huge fireworks.",
            "About Sangonomiya Kokomi\tDuring my time with the Resistance, there was no one among our ranks who wouldn't look up to Her Excellency. As someone with a great passion for military matters, victory at all costs isn't really part of her ethos. She'd always try to limit the casualties to the minimum while planning her next move. By some accounts, it also seems that she seeks to take charge of both internal and foreign affairs for Watatsumi Island. Wouldn't that be too much to expect of herself though?",
            "About Shikanoin Heizou\tDon't be deceived by his happy-go-lucky disposition. As soon as he gets working on a case, that restless energy he carries around turns into a razor-sharp focus. It's quite remarkable to witness.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: I\tYou'd like to know more about me, you say? Well, as you see, I am but a wandering samurai that you could have run into just about anywhere.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: II\tI have a very keen sense of hearing. My ears pick up all sorts of sounds: the wind through the mountain passes, the parting clouds, the sound of foxes chewing on apples in the forest, the sound of crabs blowing bubbles... This is nature's favor, it allows me to sense danger long before it draws near.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: III\tI used to love the rain when I was small. The sound of it would lull me into a peaceful sleep. But since I've grown older, my feelings have become more... complicated. I still like to listen to the rain today, but whenever I see the storm clouds start to gather, my heart sinks and I can't help but wonder: \"Hm... will some nice person let me stay the night today?\" Listening to the rain in drenched clothes is hardly peaceful — hehe... nothing can be when you're constantly interrupting yourself by sneezing.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: IV\tI never stay in a single place for very long. Stagnancy dulls both my connection with nature and the blade I wield. While I am still able to, I want to travel far and wide and meet all sorts of different people.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: V\tDon't worry — even if the day comes for us to go our separate ways, I am certain that we will meet again, in some corner of the world. The fate that brings people together is not a cord so easily cut.",
            "Kaedehara Kazuha's Hobbies\tI like falling asleep on a warm rock that's been soaking in the mid-afternoon sun, then waking up and continuing on my journey with no particular aim in mind. So long as I have my blade by my side, there is nowhere I cannot go.",
            "Kaedehara Kazuha's Troubles\tThe sounds of nature turn into a clamor of noise during stormy weather. It becomes a constant buzz in my ears. If it happens at night, I end up tossing and turning all night long without getting a wink of sleep. It's quite the headache...",
            "Favorite Food\tThe most easily obtainable food source when you're out at sea is, of course, fish. So it goes without saying that a seafaring adventurer must give careful consideration to how to cook a tasty fish-based meal... If the chance arises, I'd like you to try some of my cooking.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI am not particularly fond of food that is thrown together in a hurry without much care and attention. The way I see it, if your meal consists of a single fish, you should grill it to perfection. Eating is supposed to be an enjoyable experience, so how can we stand to be so slapdash about it?",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tThat you can make fish taste as delicious as this is proof of your outstanding culinary prowess.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tYour cooking not only fills the stomach, it also soothes my soul.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tPerhaps you should get some rest? A weary mind is a recipe for flavorless food.",
            "Birthday\tI heard it was your birthday, so I wrote a haiku for you. Unfortunately, I'm not the most talented in this area, and after trying for several evenings, I was still only able to come up with the first two lines... I guess I'll just share what I've got so far, then. \"Sun and moon rejoice / Birds of dawn sing songs anew\"... Wait, don't say a word, I think the final line is coming to me... Yes, how about... \"Far from home, with you.\" Anyway, Happy Birthday. Let's go and get you some cake, shall we?",

Who could tell that he is a wanted man throughout Inazuma?\nEven Beidou, ever the good judge of character, could not tell that Kazuha could wield a sword with the skill of a seasoned warrior when she first decided to take him in.\nWho knows if it was the storms of life that smoothed out his rough edges, or if his natural restraint has kept his edge sheathed.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe Crux, an armed fleet from Liyue, spends much of the year on the high seas, and its sailors are quite used to the vagaries of life in other nations. So they were more curious than surprised when an outlander began serving as a sailor on their flagship, the Alcor.\nThe sailor in question was picked up when the Alcor docked at the Inazuman port of Ritou.\nBeidou had made friends with this young man, and when he came on board, she told her crew, \"This guy's gonna be staying with us for a while. Take care of him, now.\"\nThe sailors trusted Beidou's judgment and admired the newcomer for his martial prowess, not to mention his ability to predict the weather, so they were happy to overlook his reticence to discuss his past, and welcomed him aboard.\nStill, their curiosity did not abate, and they would often find all sorts of excuses to try and ply him for information about his experiences.\n\"I've heard that they make some sweet blades there in Inazuma and that the bigger the fish you are, the swankier the sword. So, uh... how's yours measure up?\"\n\"...\"\nKazuha would remain silent in the face of all such queries.\nOver time, after countless attempts to garner a response proved futile, the sailors would simply give up asking.\nEventually, it was an off-the-cuff remark from Chief Mate, Juza, just a few days later that finally managed to elicit a reply.\n\"Hey, Inazuma boy. What are the lads supposed to call you if they don't even know your name?\"\nThe young sailor wiped the sweat from his brow with his callused hands.\n\"My name is Kaedehara Kazuha, a wandering samurai. I am in your debt for taking me in, so just call me 'Kazuha.'\"",
            "Character Story 2\tKazuha was not born a commoner. He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.\nInazuma City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.\nAs the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.\nHe had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.\nTo Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.\nWhen the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.\nThese are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway — so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?\nThus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind.",
            "Character Story 3\tAll travelers who outdoors roam need some skill to call their own. For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.\nAfter leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.\nAll that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.\nIt was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.\nThe traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: \"Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!\"\nBut Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: \"If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away.\"\nBut the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.\nUpon knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.\nPerhaps it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.\nWhen he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha standing nearby, looking down at him and smiling.\nBefore the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.\nKazuha smiled and said: \"The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tKazuha made many friends during his travels. One of them was particularly close to his heart, and for a time, the two journeyed together.\nBut they too would part, for their destinations were different.\nTo have met merely by chance and then form such a strong bond, there must be a fated connection between them... so, although they would part ways for now, surely they would meet again. Or so Kazuha thought.\nBut something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition — the Almighty Shogun promulgated the Vision Hunt Decree and swore to retrieve all Visions.\nAll who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.\nIt was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a \"duel before the throne,\" and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.\nThe defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself. His friend was prepared to risk all to come before the throne, partly for the chance to fight against a strong foe, but also to demonstrate the meaning of courage to all.\nAnd yet, to call for this challenge now, of all times... Kazuha feared that his punishment, should he fail, would be absolute: The Almighty Shogun would unleash her lightning upon him in its full fury, and it would surely take his life.\nEven the normally calm Kazuha could not restrain himself. He drew his sword and stormed into Tenshukaku like a whirlwind... But alas, he arrived too late.\nHis friend's sword lay shattered in pieces, his Vision now an empty husk. Now a wanted man himself, Kazuha fled with grief in his heart.\nFrom that moment on, the days of peaceful wanderings were over, and Kazuha's life became an unending series of battles.\nKazuha did not fear battle, of course, but the constant fighting left him feeling lost and perplexed.\nHe did not regret having set out on his doomed rescue mission, nor did he begrudge his friend for leaving him, but he could not help but think...\n\"Is this endless conflict truly the only way to assert one's ideals?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe Crux Fleet became Kazuha's new home, and he drifted on the ocean wherever it took him.\nTrouble still found him from time to time, but no issue was insurmountable with the support of the Crux crew.\nFrom his vantage point on the Alcor's crow's nest, gazing out at the azure sea and sky, he finally had the space to think over the tumultuous events of his past and what it all meant to him.\n\"Every samurai wishes to live their life with passion and to claim the greatest reputation possible using the sword in their hands.\"\n\"But there will always be those whose base desires lead them astray from the path of justice and virtue, and whose blades leave an endless trail of enmity in their wake.\"\n\"Surely the heavens did not give us fleshly forms and the gods did not watch over our lives all so that we might take up arms against one another.\"\n\"Then, this sword I wield is not meant to slay, but to save...\"\n\"Yes, this shall be my path as a samurai, and I shall defend it all my days.\"\nAs he reached the conclusion of his thoughts, Kazuha was suddenly inspired to pen down a few verses to serve as a maxim for himself thereafter... but before he could get started, he was interrupted by an irate voice from down below:\n\"Hey, Kazuha, quit gawking at the sky — get down here and lend a hand!\"\nIt seemed the maxim would have to wait for another day. Whatever the helmsman, Sea Drake, needed help with clearly couldn't wait.",
            "Vision Shell\tKazuha was just as surprised as everybody else when the Vision briefly lit up during that great battle.\nFor in all the time that he had spent searching high and low trying to find someone who might rekindle it, never had he imagined that he could be the one to cause its light to shine once more. It was almost as if his late friend were lending him his aid from behind the scenes.\nThis empty shell of a Vision not only proved this, but had also brought him many fateful encounters along the way:\nHe had been aided by the resistance, saved and taken in by Captain Beidou, and he had even met the fabled Traveler...\nIn life there were seasons of hopelessness and desperation, but there were also moments of great serendipity.\nHis journey was like the rise and fall of a mountain path — at times, the struggle was all but too much to bear, but there would always be moments when he would touch the clouds.",
            "Vision\tThe morning mist covered the mountains like a blanket as Kazuha trod a small trail alone.\nThe world was silent. Not a single feather flapped, and not a single cicada sang.\nEven the roiling waves seemed to have fallen into slumber, leaving just the faint whisper of the wind audible against the silence. Kazuha stuck out his tongue — the air tasted heavy and gloomy.\nThis told him that it would soon rain.\nHe peered into the distance and spotted a plume of smoke up ahead. Below it were several straw huts. Tonight, it seemed, he would have a roof over his head.\nHe informed the owner of the house that a storm was coming. At first, he was met with skepticism, but come noon the rains arrived right on cue.\nIn awe of this wanderer's skill, the master of the house eagerly offered him lodging.\nThe storm raged into the night. Kazuha held his quilt close, and as he listened to the onslaught of rain against the autumn leaves, his mind began to wander.\nIn the time since the Kaedehara Clan's fortune had faded away and he had set off on his journey, Kazuha had traveled across many of Inazuma's islands and had become intimately acquainted with the plight of the wanderer.\nMoving between islands usually necessitated traveling by sea. Kazuha would make these trips alone, in a small, slow boat, making things all the more perilous when he had to battle against strong headwinds or violent thunderstorms...\nAnd yet, there was limitless fascination to be found in this same journey of his, where the vast sky and boundless earth was his home, and all living things that inhabited them were his friends.\nIf one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.\nBut if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.\nWith his sword in his hand and his chosen path in his heart, he could go on his way with a song on his lips and with nothing to fear, no matter the perils he may face.\nKazuha slept soundly that night, his mind at rest having made peace with his feelings.\nThe next day, he awoke to the sound of birds... and a shining Vision lying upon his chest."

            "Character Story 1\tIt is a curious fact that your best chance of finding Kaeya is not by visiting the Knights' headquarters, but by frequenting the taverns at night.\nKaeya is often found sitting at the bar, gossiping with the city folk, and sipping the famed Mondstadt beverage, Death After Noon.\nHe is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of \"top candidate for grandson-in-law.\"\nIt's hard to imagine someone as mischievous, amiable, and wine-loving as Kaeya being the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius.\nHunters and bandits alike are often among Kaeya's drinking buddies. As wary of him as they may initially be, all are ultimately disarmed by his smooth talking, and end up telling him everything he wants to know.\nDepending on what they then make privy to Kaeya, their night may turn into an uncontrollable nightmare or remain one of harmless banter.\n\"Everyone's got a secret, but not everyone knows what to do with it.\"\nSays Kaeya, with his usual arrogant smirk.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Justice is not an absolute principle, but is the result of striking that fine balance between strength and strategy. As for the details of how it's done... Don't worry yourself too much about that.\"\nKaeya once said these words in front of Grand Master Varka.\nAs long as everything falls into place the way he expects in the end, Kaeya doesn't care all that much about how it's done.\nThis cavalier attitude is what defines his character.\nNot that different from Death After Noon's wild and explosive taste, one might add.\nHowever, his reckless approach to things is not uncontroversial.\nOnce, in order to force a bandit leader into facing him directly, Kaeya triggered the Ruin Guard at an ancient ruin to cut his opponent off, putting his own men at risk in the process.\nIt's times like these when even Jean, who puts a lot of trust in Kaeya, finds herself shaking her head in disapproval.\nNot that this bothers Kaeya, of course. On the contrary, he actually enjoys putting people into the difficult position of making tough decisions.\nHe takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes in the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.",

The only topic that you will never hear him discuss is his past.\nEven when the Grand Master demanded information on his background, Kaeya skirted around the issue and gave only vague answers devoid of details.\n\"One afternoon near the end of summer a decade ago, my father and I passed by the Dawn Winery.\"\n\"'I'll go get us some grape juice for the road,' he said, but he never came back.\"\n\"If Master Crepus hadn't taken me in, I doubt I'd have made it through the storm that night.\"\nThis matter-of-fact description hides a carefully constructed lie.\nKaeya has never once spoken the truth about what happened that afternoon:\n\"This is your chance. You are our last hope.\"\nKaeya's father squeezed his son's lean shoulders as he spoke, seemingly looking right through Kaeya to some place far beyond.\nOn the other side of the horizon sat their distant homeland of Khaenri'ah.\nKaeya would never forget the look of both hope and hatred in his father's eyes as he uttered those words.",

To set his father free from the unbearable agony, Diluc Ragnvindr took his life.\nKaeya was Diluc's brother by adoption and was always by his side, but on this occasion Kaeya did not partake in the final moments shared between father and son.\nThe torrential rain that set in on Mondstadt that night seemed to be a sign of the heavens' grief at the passing of Master Crepus.\nThere was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: in truth, he was an agent of Khaenri'ah, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.\nIf Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?\nFor the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.\nBut now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding. As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground, he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.\nConsumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away and all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.\nHe had anticipated Diluc's anger. The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies.\nBut as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.\nBitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc's searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.\nSince that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.\nThough it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies."

            "Character Details\tA pair of siblings have inherited the Kamisato Clan, one of the three most respected and prestigious clans in Inazuma City.\nThe elder brother, Ayato, is the head of the clan and is in charge of government affairs. While his younger sister, Ayaka, known by all as the Princess, takes care of the clan's internal and external affairs.\nAyaka often appears at social occasions and has more interactions with the common folk. As such, she is better known by the people and has gained a higher reputation than her elder brother. This has earned her the elegant title of Shirasagi Himegimi.\nAs is known to all, Ayaka, the daughter of the Kamisato family, is a figure greatly admired by the people for her beauty, dignified demeanor, and noble character.",
            "Character Story 1\tAcross Inazuma, all affairs of state that do not go up to the Raiden Shogun are largely handled by the Triarchal Council.\nThe Council's executive powers are, in turn, divided amongst three groups known as the Tri-Commission: the Yashiro Commission, the Tenryou Commission, and the Kanjou Commission.\nThe three clans that hold power over these Commissions are as follows: Kamisato, Kujou, and Hiiragi. These three great clans are known throughout Inazuma.\nKamisato Ayaka is the young lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, known far and wide as the Shirasagi Himegimi.\nWhen asked the whys and wherefores of such a nickname, many Inazumans have their own explanations...\n\"Lady Ayaka is as graceful and pure as an egret. And just look at her elegance, her clever yet proper speech — why should she not be named a Princess?\"\n\"Lady Ayaka may be of noble birth, but she is gentle and polite to us. She is kind, loyal, and is willing to help others. She even went against the opinions of others and took in that commoner, Thoma.\"\nThere are as many opinions concerning this as there are people, but none can say where the \"Shirasagi Himegimi\" nickname actually originated.\nStill, Ayaka's popularity amongst the people is quite plain to see.",
            "Character Story 2\tAs the daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Ayaka always has to remain alert to the jostling for power between noble families.\nBeing young, yet already famed throughout the land, she has been the inevitable target of provocation on the part of other noble scions who have grown jealous of the Kamisato siblings.\nThe creation and maintenance of a public image may be a formality, but for a house of standing like the Kamisato Clan, even meaningless routine has social significance.\nFailing to take part in the tangled web of Inazuman political relations risks their position as head of the Yashiro Commission. As such, the two siblings came to an accord.\nThe elder brother, Ayato, preferring not to show his face too often, would busy himself with government affairs, while the act of maintaining the clan's image would be the responsibility of the elegant, socially-adroit younger sister, Ayaka.\nThrough her dignified, demure, and polite posture, Ayaka has very much secured a place for herself in the social arena. Whether she is negotiating with potential partners or dealing with difficult nobles, her actions are all well-founded and beyond reproach.\nThe internal clan affairs are also in her care. Indeed, their estates may have descended into chaos already, if not for her.",
            "Character Story 3\tOne autumn afternoon, Ayaka was on her way home from completing certain minor affairs when she happened to hear an old voice singing from within an old house.\nWithin was an old woman, blind in both eyes, whose stick-thin fingers produced music like flowing water as they plucked at her instrument's strings.\nPerhaps it was due to her sharp ears, but the old lady heard Ayaka's footsteps and inquired as to who was outside. Not wishing to trouble the old lady, Ayaka replied that she was a nearby resident who had gotten lost and entered this place.\nAs a member of the Yashiro Commission, Ayaka was well-acquainted with the people's lives and quickly recognized this solitary old lady as the very same person who busked in the city streets when the weather was good.\nThe tune was outdated, and so was the song. As one who could not see, this lady had long fallen out of step with the times. Even in the nation that pursues eternity, some still endured such hard lives.\nOut of the goodness of her heart, Ayaka, thusly incognito, spent a long time chatting with the old lady. Taking Ayaka for an ordinary maiden, the old lady spoke of the method of making and playing the koto, and even gave her some tea leaves that she had kept stored up.\nCompared to the exquisite leaves that the Kamisato Clan had in stock, these rough leaves may as well have been grass, but Ayaka accepted them while profusely thanking her.\nThat day, she thought of her parents many times. Had they been around, would they not have grown this old someday?\nReturning home, she spoke of her encounter with her brother, and the two siblings shared the rustic tea gifted to her by the old lady.\nAfterward, Ayaka would come to see that old lady again every few days, each time posing as a person living nearby, and each time bringing with her some daily necessities that were well-loved by the common folk.\n\"The sakura trees in the streets have bloomed again,\" Ayaka said to the old lady with a smile, \"and they are as lovely as your music.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tIn people's imagination, the nobility's living expenses are orders of magnitude above the common folk. So for someone as noble as Kamisato Ayaka, surely she too must lead a life of wanton luxury.\nThis statement is only half right, however.\nAyaka does ostensibly live in a much more particular manner than the ordinary citizen.\nThe costs of studying flower arrangement and tea ceremony, sampling fine teas, and enjoying exotic flowers daily are also by no means small. However, these are all skills that she must master as a young lady of a noble house — such commitments can hardly be called \"wanton.\"\nThe things that can truly make Ayaka smile are, in fact, ordinary things that even the common folk can enjoy.\nThe making of snacks, fishing for goldfish by the ponds, squirreling herself away to read the latest novels from Yae Publishing House... Each one of these is but a tiny matter.\nAt such times, she is not the adored Shirasagi Himegimi, or Lady Ayaka, mistress of the great Kamisato estates. She is just \"Ayaka,\" an ordinary girl like any other.\nHere, she sets her dignified externalized persona aside and sets her true, casual self free. Only as \"Ayaka\" can she lay down her heavy burdens and do the things that ordinary girls can do.\nWhen hungry at night, she sneaks past the servants into the kitchen and makes herself some chazuke while humming a little tune. During tea ceremony classes, she might surreptitiously try to use the tea leaves to indulge in some romance-related astrology... The list of her little escapades goes on.\nThough she has never told anyone this, Ayaka treasures her time as an ordinary girl above all else, for these moments of freedom are things she rarely ever has.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe tutors who guide Ayaka in her various arts once used to say: whether in tea ceremony, chess, the art of the sword, or all other affairs of elegance, Ayaka is already a master.\nShe is clearly already a noble lady of superb bearing, skilled with both the pen and the sword. To be able to teach such a pupil is a teacher's pride and joy.\nStill, Ayaka thinks quietly to herself, does she truly have no regrets?\nThe essence of tea is peace and quiet.\nThe heart of the sword is the keenest edge.\nThe soul of chess is the wisdom to grasp the bigger picture.\nThese three she has grasped indeed, and the spirit of true friendship also.\nAnd yet, Ayaka is still waiting for a friend to emerge who can walk alongside her on equal footing and stand by her side.\nThat person cannot see her as a member of the Yashiro Commission, or as the Shirasagi Himegimi, nor will their conduct towards her be bound by decorum or status. And if possible, they might also be well-versed in a great many fields of study, and have witnessed all manner of interesting things... and perhaps they might even be able to tell her a story in a pinch.\nOnly such a person might become Ayaka's bosom friend.\n\"Surely, this is not too much to ask... But where might I find such a person?\"",
            "Moriwakamaru\t\"Come, come, come,\"\n\"Let's play Temari!\"\n\"1, 2, 1, 2, 3,\"\n\"The Temari goes up the Sacred Sakura Tree.\"\n\"4, 5, 4, 5, 6,\"\n\"Woosh, and over Mt. Yougou it flicks!\"\n\"7, 8, 7, 8, 9,\"\n\"The Temari returns into these hands of mine.\"\n\"Yes, into little~ Ayaka's~ hands~!\"\nThis was Ayaka's favorite nursery rhyme back in the day.\nBack then, she gave her favorite Temari the name \"Moriwakamaru,\" and she would dribble the multi-colored Moriwakamaru about while humming this very song.\nHearing her song, her parents and brother would be unable to stop themselves from smiling. Indeed, they would often join in the fun, tossing the Temari between them as a family.\nBut that was a long time ago, and Ayaka no longer plays games of Temari.\nShe has become an independent, powerful figure in her own right — and Moriwakamaru, the symbol of her childhood and the bearer of her precious memories, has also been stored away within Ayaka's cabinet.",
            "Vision\tSome years ago, the Clan underwent a huge change, and a heavy burden fell upon Ayato's shoulders. At that time, Ayaka was not yet the mature and capable person she is now.\nShe was originally a playful child, one who knew nothing of the clan's duties, and thus lacked the skill and experience needed for dealing with various kinds of people altogether.\nBut seeing her mother on her sickbed and her brother hard at work, Ayaka sensed that she too had to grow up.\nSo she decided to take up her long-disused sword arts and poetry, both staples of nobility. If she could master these two, she could at least pass for a decent lady of the Kamisato Clan, and thus help her brother show up at some festivals, alleviating his burden.\nTruth be told, Ayaka was not preternaturally gifted and would spend much time being troubled by her inability to memorize poetry, write elegantly, or brandish her sword.\nYet she did not waver — a poem she failed to memorize once would be memorized fifty times, a poorly-written word would be written fifty times over, and a sword technique that failed would be swung fifty times more.\n\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times.\" — This was something her mother told her.\nWhen her mother left this world, Ayaka was no longer \"Little Ayaka.\" She was now Kamisato Ayaka, the young lady of the Kamisato Clan, one of the Shogun's three great clans.\nSword art training thus became part of her daily life and has remained so to this day without pause.\nOn one particular day, Ayaka, at last, defeated an opponent in a single strike. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright.\n\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times\" indeed — and even the gods may thus be moved."

            "Hello\tGreetings. Ayaka has mentioned you on numerous occasions — alas, my schedule has been rather busier than anticipated recently, which belated our first meeting until today. Kamisato Ayato, head of the Kamisato Clan. Delighted to make your acquaintance.",
            "Chat: Spoiled\tI'm sure I've forgotten something... Not to worry, I'll simply send someone to fetch it. As soon as I remember what it was.",
            "Chat: Reel Them In\tEverything's in place, and they've taken the bait... Yes. Now to start reeling them in...",
            "Chat: Perverse Pleasure\tI have to stifle a smile every time I remember the look on my retainers' faces when I informed them of my plans today... Panic-stricken, but unable to muster the courage to say anything in opposition, hehe. Yes, this was a fine idea.",
            "When It Rains\tLet's take shelter for the time being. Don't worry, one of my people will be here with umbrellas momentarily.",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tAyaka was always scared of thunder as a child — until one day, mother told her that the sound of thunder is the voice of the Almighty Shogun. After that, she would start focusing intensely every time she heard the sound of thunder, as if by concentrating hard enough, she'd be able to hear exactly what Her Excellency was saying.",
            "When It Snows\tThis view reminds me of another time it snowed... that was a long time ago.",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tOpportunities to bask in the sunlight like this are few and far between.",
            "When It's Windy\tSometimes, what appears at first to be nothing but a passing breeze can ultimately be that which alters the course of events... Hehe.",
            "When the Wind Is Blowing\tMost people hunker down against a strong headwind. Only a few people know how to utilize it to their advantage.",
            "Good Morning\tGood morning. A little sword practice while the day is young is good for the body and mind. I tend to avoid having anything scheduled during these hours... What do you say? Fancy crossing blades with me?",
            "Good Afternoon\tIf there's anything in particular you'd like for lunch, just let one of my staff know in advance. As my honored guest, I'm sure they will do their utmost to accommodate you.",
            "Good Evening\tGiven the hour of your call, perhaps you might stay for dinner?",
            "Good Night\tReady to retire for the night, are we? Yes, go on then, you are excused. I'm not tired yet, so... Oh, it's you? Um, I have a few things to attend to. You should go and get some sleep.",
            "About Kamisato Ayato: Price to Pay\tEverything comes at a cost. And if you aspire to things that most could never dream of, then naturally, there will be an unimaginable price to pay.",
            "About Kamisato Ayato: Methodology\tI'm no stickler for doing things in a certain way. Whatever method you use, the important thing is that it delivers acceptable results.",
            "About Us: Most Entertaining\tHehe, I heard about the little job you pulled at the Tenryou Commission. Most entertaining... It takes a special kind of person to get old man Kujou riled up enough to start tearing his hair out. Ahh... Oh, to have been a fly on the wall.",
            "About Us: Trust\tTrusting another person isn't easy, especially for someone of high status. Place your trust in the wrong person, and it can quite literally cost you your life. But you have placed your trust in me, and of course I will not let you down.",
            "About the Vision\tA Vision is an eminently useful tool, so it only makes sense to put it to good use. Also, I like to think it's happiest in my possession because it has the chance to shine away in all its glory.",
            "Something to Share\tIf you throw fallen flowers onto the stove, the searing heat infuses them with one final spark of vitality, and for a brief moment, they radiate a more glorious glow than the flames themselves... it was a short life they lived, but it was by no means a wasted one.",
            "Interesting Things\tWhen it comes to pets... Mm, yes, I'm definitely more of a dog person myself. Cats are very independent, which has its merits, but you'll only find obedience in dogs. They'll do whatever you tell them to. Hehe, what can I say — I suppose I find loyalty to be quite an attractive quality.",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tI am confident in Ayaka's abilities. But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little more quickly than I'd intended.",
            "About Thoma\tThere is no doubt in my mind about Thoma's loyalty to the Kamisato Clan. A long time ago, partly to see where he stood, I advised him that he would be better off leaving if he didn't want to get drawn into the never-ending disputes that plague public life. Still, he chose to stay, and in all the time he's been with us, he's spared me much worry. There are very few people I trust completely these days, but Thoma is one of them.",
            "About Sayu\tShe looks awfully idle the majority of the time, and yet when it counts, she always rises to the occasion and provides indispensable assistance. Of course, you'd know far more about that than me, wouldn't you?",
            "About Yoimiya\tAh, the fireworks store owner. Yes, a most... spirited young lady. The Kamisato Clan is on rather close terms with her. She is around the same age as Ayaka, and the two get along very well. I trust her direct and outspoken disposition won't lead Ayaka astray. Ayaka has always been staunchly true to herself, ever since she was a young child.",
            "About the Raiden Shogun\tThe cost of pursuing eternity has been great for the Almighty Shogun... and for all of Inazuma. These wounds will take time to heal, and as someone with a mediating role to play in the political process, I will be sure to fulfill that which is required of me.",
            "About Yae Miko\tLady Guuji has been kind to us in the Kamisato Clan, but she has never quite taken to me personally. I trust you'll have heard the way she refers to me... \"the Yashiro rascal\" and other such flattering monikers. We run into each other semi-regularly, given the overlap in our work, and despite whatever private thoughts we each may have, our working relationship is quite a harmonious one. I have no great objection to this state of affairs — working with intelligent people always makes things highly efficient. In any case... However objectionable she might find me, she would be forced to admit that without me, she would have no one to help execute her weird and wonderful ideas.",
            "About Kujou Sara\tOld man Kujou capitalized on a golden opportunity to create a most formidable weapon indeed. The only flaw in his plan being, he is now no longer able to wield the weapon of his creation.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tOnce upon a time, the Kaedehara Clan was a subordinate branch of the Kamisato Clan. My forebears may have failed to save his family from decline, but even today I have a duty to support him. Now, naturally, there is nothing I can do to restore his clan's former fortunes. But as for helping him avoid arrest by the Tenryou Commission, that is well within my capabilities...",
            "About Arataki Itto\tNow he's an interesting case. Pitting docile Onikabuto against each other in battle... heh, that's a first... I was only speaking in polite platitudes when I gave him that little pep talk, but to my surprise he started calling me \"bro\"... To this day, he calls me \"my bro Ayato\" without the faintest idea of my true identity. It's quite alright by me, though, I have nothing against his... unique character.",
            "About Ningguang\tI have heard a thing or two about how Her Eminence, the Tianquan operates. On the subject, I also happen to have a limited-edition copy of Liyue Millennial, if you're interested? What do you say, shall I have someone fetch it, so we can play a game?",
            "More About Kamisato Ayato: I\tYou want to know about me? Hmm. Things aren't always a case of the more you know, the better. Plenty of proverbs to corroborate that, as I'm sure you're aware. Maybe we'll have the chance to talk more next time.",
            "More About Kamisato Ayato: II\tStrange tastes, you say...? You seem to misunderstand me. Let me be quite clear: Most of the time, I simply enjoy watching people's facial contortions when they're put in an awkward position. Watching them squirm, you might say. Is that so strange? I would have thought you tease your little friend here on a regular basis for precisely that purpose, no?",
            "More About Kamisato Ayato: III\tThe Tri-Commission may appear calm and well-run, but I can assure you it is quite tumultuous beneath the placid surface. There is no pleasure to be had in mixing with the powers that be. I shall spare you the details. Just know that... I have never done anything to dishonor the Kamisato Clan. Neither in the past, when I was working to bring stability to our clan, nor here in the present, where I am working for the sake of all of Inazuma.",
            "More About Kamisato Ayato: IV\tYou want to know about the Shuumatsuban? I suppose there's no harm in divulging a detail or two to you. It's a secret unit that reports directly to the head of the Kamisato Clan. Accordingly, after my father passed, it came to me. There are certain situations I cannot directly involve myself in, and in these cases, being able to rely on the Shuumatsuban is often instrumental in achieving a resolution. Most of its members are orphans whom we take in and raise from a young age. This way, loyalty is guaranteed to the greatest extent possible, and we are spared a great deal of worry.",
            "More About Kamisato Ayato: V\tDo I have other tricks up my sleeve beyond the Shuumatsuban? Well, naturally. If even the cunning bunny burrows thrice, then what of the cunning human? But anyway, I've shared enough of my secrets. I think it's time I heard your story. Oh, and... you can spare the part about traveling in Teyvat. Tell me about before that.",
            "Kamisato Ayato's Hobbies\tHobbies... I had one or two as a child, but these days most of my time is taken up by my official duties, so they don't count... Hmm? Some people treat work as a hobby, you say? Goodness me. How very... exceptional.",
            "Kamisato Ayato's Troubles\tTroubles? Whenever something's troubling me, it must be dealt with swiftly and comprehensively. And whenever someone is troubling me... Hehe...",
            "Favorite Food: Personal Preference\tVariety is the spice of life. In that sense, the Milk Tea Medley they started serving over in Hanamizaka recently isn't half bad. You should try it sometime. Other than that... I don't have any particular preferences when it comes to the food I eat on a daily basis. I have dedicated staff to arrange my daily meal plan, and whatever they serve, I eat.",
            "Favorite Food: Trying New Things\tYou couldn't perchance tell me your own tastes, could you? ...Ah, I see. Okay, I've made a note of that. Now I know what to say the next time I get asked about it.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tHmm... it looks like I mixed up my salt and my sugar. Savory Mizu Manjuu. Yes, this can work. I'll give them to Thoma.",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tVery novel indeed. Haha, it meets my requirements perfectly...",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tI see. So this is your take on this dish...",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tHere's a suggestion: Try using this dish in the hot pot game next time you play.",
            "Birthday\tHappy Birthday! Now, how would you like to be Yashiro Commissioner for a day, hmm? All the work has been handled already, so you can focus on simply enjoying the feeling of having an enormous amount of executive power at your fingertips. Don't worry, the retainers won't dare question it, I'll be with you the entire time, hehe.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tDid I just grow more competent? Goodness, how marvelous...",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tAt the end of the day, power is only a source of comfort when it is concentrated in one's own hands.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tHehe, I'm sure certain people are starting to grow rather nervous right about now...",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tI've had very few chances to kick back and put my feet up since taking over leadership of the clan. But things have felt curiously different since having you around. Hmm... Yes, it feels rather like basking in the sun.",

            "Character Details\tAs clan head of the Kamisato Clan, one of the great clans of the Tri-Commission, Kamisato Ayato is a household name in Inazuma.\nHowever, people do not have quite the same clear impression of him as they do of the Shirasagi Himegimi, the elegant and kind Ayaka.\nMost only know that he is an important figure in the Shogunate and the head of a famed noble house. But as for the details, there's little that they can say for sure.\nSome people say that \"the Yashiro Commission's festivals and events are ever meticulous and have been full of consideration for the people. Surely the Commissioner's hand is in all such matters.\"\nBut others also say \"ah, but there is much to politics that should never see the light of day. And how could he have kept such a lofty position without a few tricks up his sleeve, hmm?\"\nAyato himself is unfazed by such comments.\n\"Well, I consider myself merely a serious, dutiful public servant who owes his allegiance to the Almighty Shogun.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tKamisato Ayato, as the eldest son of Inazuman nobility, was greatly loved from the moment he was born.\nThough his parents were too busy to always spend time with him, they took good care of him, and in any case the \"young master\" never lacked for people around to look after his every need.\nWhen he was somewhat older, he would, at his father's request, begin a complex and strict training regimen as the family successor.\nBut not all went as well as they might have hoped, and the pressures in the court and at home would weigh heavily on his father's health, resulting in an early passing.\nThe young Ayato was thus thrust into a battle for the survival of the clan's position.\nIn those days, none were impressed by this inexperienced youngster. Ayato went from being an elegant and refined princeling to \"the poor young master of the Kamisato Clan\" amongst the people, and \"that greenhorn\" amongst his political opponents.\nTime, however, would prove these people wrong.\nWith extraordinary courage and some first-rate tactics, he did not leave the clan to languish. No, indeed, the Kamisato Clan's position would grow more stable than ever.\nThe heavy workload, malicious deceptions, and attempts to frame him at every turn he parried away, even turning them to his own advantage.\nThe passage of time has only increased the standing of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan in the Shogunate and with the people.\nToday, Ayato is a clan head that a great house like the Kamisato Clan would be proud of, and a Yashiro Commissioner acknowledged by all.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe Yashiro Commission is in charge of ritual matters on Narukami Island, and must also attend to matters of cultural leisure in such a manner that deities and the people alike are pleased — and they do, honoring their commission.\nBut with greater responsibilities come greater amounts of work.\nFortunately, his sister Ayaka shares much of the clan's responsibilities, with most of the interactions between the Commission and the people falling to her, allowing Ayato to spend most of his time on matters of governance.\nDealing with Shogunate officials is no easy matter. People come from different Commissions and clans, and their perspectives are very different. Any single task grows harder as the number of people involved grows.\nAyato's great strength lies in his ability to handle such matters. The way he sees it, people are driven by interest. Find leverage, and the other side will cooperate.\nFind some goal that will bring the other party around to your logic, then pacify them with a few choice platitudes for the occasion, and most problems can be resolved.\nAnd when dealing with the stubborn, one merely needs to appeal to a higher power to bear — after all, what mortal could gainsay the light of heaven itself, no matter how high their status or arrogant their attitude?\nOver time, the knowledgeable and decorous Kamisato clan head gained quite the name for himself in the Shogunate.\n\"Hmm... this matter seems quite hard to handle. Should we ask the Yashiro Commissioner?\"\nSo people would often say.\nHowever, while Ayato is indeed full of ways and means, he will not simply help at any given moment.\nFirstly, not every task is related to the Yashiro Commission. Secondly, it is simply not worth it for the Kamisato Clan to get itself involved for the sake of others' petty profit.\nMostly, Ayato will simply tag along as a junior figure, teacup in hand, doing little more than smiling.\n\"Ah, come now, Sir Nagaoka. We are all loyal servants of the Almighty Shogun. Nothing more to it. We just need to be open with each other, and I'm sure we can resolve this issue together.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tBeing limited by his station and work, Ayato does not often appear in public, nor does he have much time for any sort of leisurely walk. However, these obstacles cannot hinder him from learning of new and interesting things.\nPerhaps in the morning, he might spy one of the Yae Publishing House staff poking her head around the place, seemingly here to \"report for work.\" In which case, he may as well pretend not to notice, all the better to hear what new methods she has for skipping work... and then \"accidentally\" let slip his newfound knowledge to Guuji Yae.\nIn a meeting with those old fogeys at Tenshukaku, there is no need to speak too quickly. After all, watching grown people argue till they are red in the face over petty issues is quite amusing.\nWhile walking through the streets, he might suddenly consider a certain unique snack stand. Going up to the owner, he'd ask if they are selling anything new, how business is going, buy a drink or two to try... and if he finds it interesting, he'll buy a few back for the rest of the household.\nLately, he also lent some encouragement to the young oni who frequents Hanamizaka due to the latter's bug-fighting troubles — out of the goodness of his heart, of course. He also discovered that this crimson oni did not know what the name \"Ayato\" signified... which was fine, of course. No need to explain such things.\nOn the way home, he might pass Chinju Forest and see passers-by having tricks played on them by the bake-danuki, in which case he will point the illusion out. If the bake-danuki should hone their changeling skills further on his account, why, they should thank him for the inspiration.\nAnd of course, even one so talented as Thoma might sometimes struggle to think of what to make for dinner. Such occasions are perfect for a hot pot game! After all, Ayaka always puts the most unexpected things into the pot — and how proud he is of his sister for that!\nYes, these things are indeed the spice of the Yashiro Commissioner's life.",
            "Character Story 4\tBetween the butler and the housekeeper, the Kamisato estate is always spick and span, inside and out... except for one location.\nKamisato Ayato's table is always a terrible mess after he uses it.\nBooks are strewn about, open and even dumped face-down on the table, while documents of uneven size are stacked haphazardly. The ink on the inkstone is never really properly kept, and one might even sometimes find chess pieces or cards under the table.\nEach time the clan head gets off work, the servants always need some time to clean his study up.\nIn the process, they discovered that assorted notes are often clipped between these pages. Upon closer inspection, they are written in different hands, and their content also varies.\n\"Clan Head, the servants have sent a new batch of flowers. I have placed them in a flower vase in a corner of the table. Please take care not to knock it over again.\"\n\"Clan Head, a shrine maiden from the Grand Narukami Shrine came over today, saying that the Lady Guuji wishes to see you. It seems important, as it involves the requisitioning of land in Ritou. She invites you to the Shrine to discuss the details.\"\n\"Lord Commissioner, the Momoyo flowers have not withered. The branches grow yet. Do not worry.\"\n\"Dear Brother, I learned a new recipe while attending festivities with the Traveler. Considering that {Mhe}{Fshe} is from another land, do you think... that I might need to make some changes to said recipe?\"\n\"Clan Head, the servants have been reluctant to tell you this, so allow this old lady to say it. If you wish to eat something, please leave it to our housekeeper. Also, please refrain from using the ingredients in the kitchen... How could we make you cook for yourself, after all?\"\nAyato's work often sees him leaving home early and returning late. As such, the people of the Kamisato Estate will communicate with him through these means.\nThis was a method that Ayato came up with himself, and this is how the Kamisato household is run, via these small notes.\nUnfortunately, their use has seen the clan head's already messy table become messier still... Oh well, just a small sacrifice. Nothing worth writing home about.",
            "Character Story 5\tIn Inazuma, people will sometimes pray to deities by offering certain kinds of cypress leaves.\nBut as such rituals lack scale, they are often forgotten amidst the many, both large and small, that are conducted throughout the land.\nThough some time has passed, Ayato still remembers his mother mentioning that though these cypresses are evergreen, their leaves are not needle-like.\nInstead, they have large, crisp leaves that will not wither and fall even when new ones grow.\nAs such, it is associated with the concept of \"prosperity,\" and was often used in ancient times as ritual plating for food offerings.\nToday, people no longer use leaves as mats upon which to spread food, but the habit of offering cypress leaves persists nonetheless.\nPerhaps it was just a hobby of hers, or perhaps she was just well-read in general, but whatever the case, his mother always had a great deal to say about festival affairs.\n\"Perhaps the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission were born to protect the deities.\"\nIn his younger years, Ayato had not fully agreed with this statement.\nHe believed that the Kamisato Clan was the Kamisato Clan, and that it belonged to the family's members. That was the reason for its existence, and any service to the gods was a job, a matter of circumstance.\nBut such presumptuous words could never be said out loud, and in any case, Ayato could not bear to interrupt his mother when she looked so excited.\nNo matter how long she would go on, Ayato would always sit in front of her and listen in silence, even if his legs might fall asleep in the process.\nWith the passing of years, Ayato's days would be taken up by swordsmanship and books. The one giving the \"lessons\" was now his father, and the lesson content would turn from ritual affairs to matters that the clan's successor should be concerned with.\nHis duty to the clan would be something that would occupy yet more space in Ayato's life. Nor was the Raiden Shogun just a mere symbol as she was in his childhood. Now, she was the Ogosho, the mighty defender of Inazuma's eternal peace.\n\"The Kamisato Clan stands today because of Narukami's mercy. As such, the Clan must defend the road to Eternity, and follow the Shogun eternally.\"\n\"This was our agreement, and it is the unchanging rule of our clan. Remember this well.\"\nAs for the specifics of what happened, Ayato had already gleaned some of them from reading their ancestral teachings. It was the Kamisato elders' failings that had resulted in the nationally-important Raiden Gokaden to suffer great loss. If not for Guuji Yae's intervention on their behalf, causing the Shogun to show them mercy, the Kamisato Clan may have joined others in falling from grace and ceasing to exist.\nThis was the grace of Her Excellency, and at the same time, it was a warning from Her servant.\nAs such, Ayato never snubbed his father's teachings. Though he still believed in protecting his clan above all else, he also understood that Inazuma was sustained by the Electro Archon's protection. Only peace in Inazuma could guarantee the longevity and prosperity of the clan.\nNo matter how things might change in Inazuma, the Kamisato Clan alone would never betray the Almighty Narukami.\nEven if his heart said differently, he could only bury it deep beneath well-maintained appearances.\nJust as his mother said back then—\n\"The divinely-protected cypress will sprout new leaves from ancient branches.\nSo, too, can the camellia in the courtyard remain fragrant even in the most bitter winter.\"",
            "Yumemiru Pen Case\tEven Kamisato Ayato himself could not have expected that calligraphy practice, which he had found most boring in his youth, would eventually become a favored pastime of his.\nHe had slogged through much penmanship practice to better play the part of the Kamisato Clan's eldest son.\nBut nowadays, he transcribes a few poems from time to time to clear his mind and think in silence.\nOf course, this also lets him seem like he is busy with official business even while idle, all the better to avoid seeing some people and doing certain things.\nWith time's passing, it became agreed among the servants waiting on him that he not only liked to play chess but was also fond of calligraphy.\nSuch talk would spread widely via word of mouth. As such, Ayato often receives excellent brushes as gifts during festivals or birthdays.\nSome of the more speculative have even bought him exquisite and expensive quill pens from overseas.\nAyato has never attempted to clarify this matter, but instead had a lovely wooden case made in which he stores such stationery.\nHe has always been interested in all things new, and trying out these new pens is indeed fun.\nMoreover, these gifts often say much about the person who sent them. Such information thus becomes one of the means by which Ayato can get a handle on them.\nThat said, though he claims to have bought this case to store stationery, there are three pens that Ayato has never placed inside it.\nOne of them, slim and well-crafted, is placed on his desk. It shows signs of some wear and tear, but it writes well, and is used for writing petitions.\nThe second is stored in a drawer at the bottom, its fine tip having seen much loving use in the past when Ayato was practicing calligraphy. Its beginner-friendly nature also saw it borrowed quite often by Thoma and Ayaka back in the day.\nAs for the third, it is stored deep within a wooden cabinet used to store antiques, sealed within a silk bag. Excellent of make and design, it was presented to him by his mother during his adulthood ceremony.",
            "Vision\tOne night, many years ago, Ayato's gravely-ill father summoned him into his presence.\nThat night, his father seemed a little different from the illness-weathered figure he had become. His expression was solemn, and yet the concern in his eyes was all too clear.\nForcing himself to stay alert, he asked Ayato: was his training done? Had he eaten enough for dinner? How was his swordsmanship progressing?\nAs Ayato replied, his father nodded with a smile, seemingly satisfied. Yet, his expression would quickly darken, as if there was something he wanted to, but could not say.\nAfter much hesitation, and under his wife's melancholic gaze, his father would finally speak, his voice heavy:\n\"Ayato... Remember, no matter what happens to the Kamisato Clan in the future, you are our eldest son, Ayaka's elder brother... A successor the Kamisato Clan is proud to have.\"\nAfter reminding his father to rest well, Ayato would take leave of his parents and return to his bedroom.\nThe moment he opened the door, he saw the shining Vision lying on his desk.\nAyato had heard since he was young that Visions are signs of the gods' favor, born of human wishes.\nSince his youth, he had longed to become the family's pillar, not for any great work, but to ensure that the clan would prosper, and to protect them.\nThat this Vision should appear now... meant that, perhaps, the time had come for him to take up this burden.\nSo thinking, Ayato did not call for the servants to light the lamps. Instead, he merely sat down beside the table.\nMany things flowed through his mind then like a tide:\nHis father was gravely ill, and his mother was also unwell. The clan was leaderless, and its competitors eyed its position and power hungrily, as they had for some time now.\nHis sister was still young, and he had to ensure that she grew up safely. The Shogunate courts were like a sea full of hidden reefs. One had to tread most carefully there...\nThey could not let go of the Shuumatsuban, command over which had passed down through the family for generations. As for the servants, some few might still be trusted should the Kamisato Clan's strength wane...\nAnd as for Thoma, who had come from a different land, though he was a friend and useful ally both, would he consider other options should the Kamisato Clan truly fall?\nThese scattered thoughts would gradually straighten themselves out in Ayato's mind, and at their center was his still-unchanged conviction—\nHe would use any means at his disposal to secure the safety of his family and its future. Obstacles to that goal would be cleared away, no matter the cost.\nThat night, the Vision was the only light that accompanied him.\nAnd when the first light of the next dawn alighted upon the desk, the young heir was already prepared to face the world."

            "Character Details\tIn a land brimming with as much talent as Sumeru, one is practically spoiled for choice when it comes to designers. But when one speaks of architects, few are those who will not subconsciously think of \"Kaveh.\"\nThe Kshahrewar graduate was once named the greatest architect in several decades and is known as the Light of Kshahrewar. Kaveh himself, however, is unfortunately unmoved by this title.\nSuch lovely names and titles are, to him, acknowledgment and shackles both. For example, Kaveh's insolvency remains a matter of shame for him to this day. A person with little to no standing could just admit to such a thing, but a famous architect cannot. In fact, such undue candor might result in a crisis of reputation for him. So, Kaveh cannot but avoid this topic to save face, and be forced to masquerade as a man living in leisure.\nThanks to his abilities as a designer and his astounding aesthetic attainments, people believe in his talent, and thus, in his facade also.\nAfter all, what could possibly trouble Kaveh, architect extraordinaire?",
            "Character Story 1\tUp till today, one can hear Kshahrewar students discuss and speculate about their alumnus Kaveh at the Palace of Alcazarzaray and various parts of the Akademiya. In the hearts of his Darshan-mates, Kaveh is a genius nigh-unparalleled in the last few decades and an architect of great fame. Kaveh has, by his outstanding works, engraved his name into the history of the Akademiya. If you are to meet Kshahrewar students, it wouldn't hurt to listen to them extol his achievements: Single-handedly designing the Palace of Alcazarzaray, renovating the landmark lighthouse of Port Ormos, modifying the port's elevators and cargo-handling structures, his pioneering role in the spatial optimization of the peripheral areas surrounding forests and valleys... The list goes on.\nClad in these achievements, Kaveh has become more than a simple name, but a synonym for achievement in the field of design. Many wish they could have a resume like his: brilliantly talented in school, invited to work in various major construction agencies after graduation, and leaving after several years to do work under his own name.\nAll outsider readings of his life stop here, and almost none know of the hidden truth behind the stories — the truth that Kaveh himself is trying to hide. It is true, of course, that he is an exceptional designer. It is a shame, then, this has not allowed him to live the perfect life that others think he does.\nHe would summarize his past experiences in this way: Misunderstandings are troublesome but inevitable. All people are vulnerable to momentary lapses in judgment and to the influence of rigid labels. For example, their first reaction to \"designer\" is the fantasy of someone who earns Mora with a flick of their fingers, who becomes famous with but a few strokes of a pen. And when people think about \"the arts,\" the first thing that emerges is the bizarre, unfounded image of some lackadaisical, self-centered soul who swings between bouts of gloom and mania, and who is all too fond of bossing others about.\nKaveh does not fit any such imaginative fantasies. He cannot complete his designs in a single stroke, instead approaching every job earnestly. He dresses like a successful person, but in truth, he does not judge the merit of a project by the remuneration alone. He is principled beyond most other people in Sumeru, believing that \"art\" is the wellspring of a life in design, and yet does not forsake humanistic purpose or practicality in the process. Indeed, he is willing to make some compromises for these two things. Sometimes, he compromises on rest time, other times it is the ornamentation and trappings of the project... and sometimes it is his own pay.\nAfter many years, he finally succeeded. The Palace of Alcazarzaray was completed, and he returned to Sumeru in glory. His colleagues had naught but praise for the fabled palace atop a large tree, stunned as they were by its designer's astounding imagination. They gorged themselves upon the way in which the structure united architectural function and human narrative into its elegant design values, resulting in luxurious craftsmanship that yet exists as a testament to precision and elegance, rewriting the atmosphere of the surrounding mountainous space with its very presence. No one would say that the Palace of Alcazarzaray was any less than an exceedingly successful experiment.\nThose colleagues, however, were blissfully unaware of how Kaveh went bankrupt over this project due to a mix of personal principle, the vagaries of life, and other problems layered atop one another. After all, the truth — much like the troubled gestation of this success — has remained well-hidden thanks to Kaveh's efforts.",
            "Character Story 2\tKaveh was born into a classic scholarly family in Sumeru. His father was from the Rtawahist Darshan and once worked at the Akademiya, while his mother had graduated from Kshahrewar, and much as he would become later in life, she too was a famous architect. Influenced by them, Kaveh was interested in architectural design from a young age. They would sit in the living room as he sat at home playing with the block puzzles they had bought for him.\nTheirs was a house in which words were not necessary, and Kaveh would gain his understanding of \"home\" from this time.\nHowever, their blissful days were not to last. Some time before he joined the Akademiya, his father would, at his encouragement, join the Interdarshan Championship. The competition itself was not a complicated affair, but his father, who became a favorite to win, would miss becoming champion by a hair, and then proceeded to go missing for a time afterward.\nSoon, the bad news came: His father had perished in an accident in the desert. The suddenness of this misfortune threw mother and son into disarray. His mother was hit particularly hard. Being a sensitive soul by nature, her husband's passing would cause her to break down, spending much time in anxious, gloomy thought. As for Kaveh, he would see his father's laugh and promise to bring something nice back for him as he walked out that door every time he closed his eyes to sleep. Young Kaveh thought that had he not said anything, his father might not have taken part in the contest, and he would not have gone missing afterward, and finally perished as a result. But no matter how he begged, the past could not be changed. His father's death, his mother's agony... all these things that could no longer be taken back were on the account of a single thing he had said. From that day forward, he would live under the shadow of that guilt.\nHis mother would say that her husband was a man with a good heart, and that life at such a person's side made her happy. Indeed, after his passing, she would never again smile. \"Home\" went from a sanctuary of warmth and light to a cold and lonely hall. Kaveh would often find his mother sitting on the sofa staring at her trembling hands in silence. She could neither draw anything at all, nor even conceive of a design in her mind. Each time this happened, Kaveh would feel like a giant hand was crushing him to the ground, and he would question himself: Were it not for me, would the family have ended up like this?\nAt that time, he was still young, and he could do very little. Out of guilt, he would do his best to keep his mother company, and he would never wear a disappointed face around her, trying to support her in any way he could, even if such was but a drop in the bucket.\nIt was amidst this chaos that Kaveh would reach schooling age and, having passed the entrance exams, enroll into Kshahrewar. During this time, he would inevitably spend less time with his mother. She would thus travel to Fontaine to ease her soul a little. There, she would receive a job offer, and upon returning to Sumeru, she informed Kaveh of the good news. Kaveh knew that this would leave him to live alone, but still, he agreed, and even saw his mother off on the day she departed.\nHe would continue to look on even after her ship had long left the harbor. He would deeply miss her, but he knew that it was best that she left the place that had come to represent so much pain for her. For her sake, Kaveh would never admit that he was lonely. He assured her that he was all grown up now and could live independently. And if he should be kept awake at night by loneliness, pain, or memories of their now-broken family, why, it was his just desserts for egging his father on to take part in the competition. One guilty of harming his parents so deeply deserved all that came to them, and so he must live on bearing that brand.\nGiven that such thoughts have been his constant companions since, one could say that \"home\" taught Kaveh how to care, and also utterly purged him of the ability to knowingly harm another person. In the many years afterward, he would remain trapped by his personality and ideals, desiring to help any and all who asked it of him, and unable to truly oppose others even if he wished to try and resist on some matters. Despite the good he often does, his guilt remains. More than this, he cannot accept pure goodwill, for when he makes choices, he believes that he should be punished, and finds some comfort in the pain.\nIf Kaveh were a sculpture, he would be one that appeared all but flawless, but which would suffer utter destruction if the weak point in its core were to be found.",
            "Character Story 3\tAfter graduating, Kaveh's first project was helping out with a group project with other students of the same Darshan, though they had different mentors. This being his debut as the person responsible for design, the work weighed heavily on him. But he is (by his own admission) a stubborn person, and he would spend all his energy on his work, and thus would he shoulder the work for others, heedless of the hour, on all manner of projects for two entire years.\nOnce he had gained enough experience, Kaveh left these cooperative projects behind to work in his own name, gaining a clientele who appreciated his style. Some would ask him to design buildings, and this marked the beginning of his career. By dint of his hard work, he was able to save up a good sum of Mora. It did not take long, however, for Kaveh to hit a bottleneck. The demands of the market were very different from academic design. It was more pragmatic, more snobbish, and the clients' requirements were far harder to meet than his mentors' had been. At the same time, academic trends in Sumeru were disrupting his work. He began to realize that his ideals and career goals were, as a certain someone had said, not easily attainable.\nNew iterations of the schools of thought and viewpoints amongst researchers were constantly being created, and there was no lack of those who would engage in self-critique and self-reflexive questioning, with changes and improvements in social factors encouraging such considerations. As such, things that were once recommended might someday become objects of criticism, whether they be actual books or art.\nBut other than those who had given themselves wholly over to art, no one could understand what artists in Sumeru had to endure. As academic accomplishment became ever more prized in Sumeru, researchers would in turn value pure academic accomplishments and practical skills more highly. The Six Sages would grow ever more radical in their ways, and the idea that \"the arts provide no real benefits\" started to become mainstream. Thus, those who worked in the arts would be marginalized, and those subjects that were often related to the arts sought to distance themselves.\nThe engineering projects that Kaveh came into contact with were highly streamlined, bereft of flair or style. He would suggest various beautiful designs, only to have them rejected on the grounds that they were \"meaningless presentation,\" or that \"this project only needs practical buildings.\" His original pursuit was to make good designs for all that incorporated both artistic beauty and practicality, but now that the arts had become a joke, and people rejected their necessity and value, no one would give him freedom to work on his designs. Kaveh, believing that architecture was indeed art, resolutely opposed such viewpoints. But his job required him to have technical support and investments, and so he could not escape these circles, nor could he simply put his views out there in the open for fear that he might drag too many others down with him.\nWith his dreams and career now at odds, Kaveh gave himself a long vacation. But when he returned home, he received an unexpected letter from Fontaine. It was from his mother, and she wrote that she had found someone to whom she could entrust the rest of her life, and as such was going to remarry in Fontaine. It was this news that she would, with great trepidation and expectation, relate to her only relative.\nKaveh wrote back and congratulated her, and would even go to Fontaine to take part in the wedding. It was a simple affair, and only a few guests were present. Seeing his mother smile once more, Kaveh felt glad, but felt lost again almost immediately afterwards.\nHis mother would leave all her property in Sumeru to him. Three days later, he would return to Sumeru, and once again felt the terror of the empty home — the mere act of sitting on the sofa tormented him with heretofore unmatched solitude. Here, he felt the old adage of all wise scholars being fulfilled: \"Do the right thing, no matter what it costs you.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tThe more he continued to work in the construction industry, the stronger Kaveh's displeasure with the current state of society grew. It was at this moment that a turning point came. The wealthy merchant, Lord Sangemah Bay, sought him out to construct a private mansion.\nLord Sangemah Bay had become fairly famous, but Kaveh had no idea that this \"Lord\"'s name was in fact Dori until they met, nor did he have any reckoning of her power and riches. She only had two conditions for this mansion, that it be large and extravagant. Kaveh would probe her concerning design style and other details, but she was unconcerned with such. Even amongst his clients, Dori stood out as a bit of an oddity. She did business, but seemed to care little for what researchers thought. She wanted her mansion built in a secluded place — for business needs, or so she claimed — and Kaveh was told not to ask too many questions and simply aim to make a truly awe-inspiring estate. As for aesthetics, Dori neither cared for nor stopped him from doing anything he wished.\nKaveh realized almost immediately how rare it was to come by such a commission. A mansion construction project without limitations meant that he could put his all into it. Party A would fork out the resources, while Party B would do the work — was this not how their business should be? And was allowing academic views to restrict development and growth not utterly wrong-headed? So it was with that Kaveh threw himself in planning these designs with a sudden fervor, and, in his role as \"Party B,\" he advised Dori to make some adjustments. A true mogul could not simply live in the mountains. If this estate was to go down in history, it had to be something of truly legendary beauty! A garden was a must, with the flowers carefully selected, of course, with the input of professional botanists. The conceptualization must be bold, the planning conscientious. The buildings themselves would prioritize practicality, but the requested warehouses and facilities would rest upon a luxuriant foundation. And as for location... the cliff-side in the northern mountains looked good. Lord Sangemah Bay would awaken every day with a window onto the loveliest natural views that could be had.\nThough Dori would constantly insist that the mansion did not have to be close to a cliff, Kaveh's engineering spirit and aesthetic appetites drove him on to convince her otherwise. Thus did the project begin with a flourish, and as the days passed, work proceeded apace under Kaveh's watchful eye.\nYet his ideals would not be so easily achieved, for though Kaveh's diligence in selecting a site had been immaculate, and he had made every consideration, he could not have anticipated the speed at which the Withering would expand its reach that year. When the work was 70% complete, on a quiet night, the Withering crept in silently, destroying all that had been built overnight. The sight of his creation's devastated corpse struck Kaveh like a furious thunderbolt. Dori, who had rushed down upon receiving the news, was in incomparable fury, demanding that Kaveh leave the project. Though the Forest Rangers quickly dispersed The Withering, the buildings were beyond saving.\nYet he knew that it would be difficult to ever get a chance of this sort again, and so he begged Dori to let him finish the Palace of Alcazarzaray. Dori would point out the crucial problem with stark sharpness: He had been the one to insist on the change of site. Now that the palace had been destroyed, taking the investment put in thus far with it, how could the project continue, even assuming that she did not pursue the matter with him? If they were to rebuild the structure, who would bear the cost for the losses?\nKaveh sat atop the ruins as he contemplated this all night long. He had his savings, and the property his parents had left behind. That had once been his \"home,\" but now, it was just an empty building. And what was a \"home,\" anyway? An architect like him knew better than most that a construction bereft of a family or people to dwell in it was no \"home.\" It was simply a building.\nWhen the sun rose, Kaveh returned to Sumeru City and sold that house. Adding all the proceeds from that sale, along with his savings, to the funds Dori had provided with him, he was able to come up with 70% of the necessary Mora required, with Dori coming up with the rest.\nThus was the Palace of Alcazarzaray built on a beautiful, sunny day. Kaveh had given all he possessed to build a legendary palace that did not belong to him in the slightest. He did not earn a single Mora on this project. On the contrary, some slight overspending on the follow-up work would leave him heavily in debt to Dori. While Kaveh made a token show of resisting, he knew in his heart that he could not deny the fact that he did indeed owe this debt. His heart was once again consumed by that old guilt, and Lord Sangemah Bay, shrewd merchant that she was, could immediately perceive that he was paying not for her sake, but for that of his ideals.\nAnd if someone wanted to martyr their entire fortune on the altar of their ideals, who was she to stop them? Construction was ultimately just business, but ideals were priceless. As for how Kaveh would come to be homeless afterward, that is a different story.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter going bankrupt, Kaveh entered into a period of melancholy. The Palace of Alcazarzaray had ever so briefly filled the hole in his heart that had been ripped open by so many things, but it had also proved to him once again that no matter what he gave to attain his ideals, it wasn't enough. He was now directionless, and enmeshed in a world where he could not go anywhere without Mora. And yet he was accustomed since his youth to putting on a brave front, and so Kaveh was unwilling to let his colleagues and friends know that he was nigh penniless even after selling all he owned, and so he went to a tavern, where he would order a few bottles and chat to comfort himself. One bottle later, he would collapse at the table, only to wake up in the exact same position afterward.\nLambad, the tavern owner, had reserved a seat and a few free drinks for him out of kindness, and as thanks, Kaveh helped him redesign and refit the booth seating area of the tavern's second floor. He would occasionally meet friends from his Akademiya schooling days, and with them he would pretend that he was just here to drink and gather inspiration. He would spend over a fortnight in this manner, during which he would encounter that friend that he no longer called \"friend.\"\nWhen discussing Kaveh's old friends, the current Akademiya Scribe, Alhaitham of Haravatat, will invariably get mentioned. Alhaitham enrolled at a later date than most of those his age, but his grades stood out above the rest. People didn't know who he was or where to find him normally, only that he was some student who had gotten high marks. And when his name was mentioned, even the old researchers from Kshahrewar would shake their heads and say that he was too intelligent by half and hard to get along with.\nAt that time, Kaveh had just parted ways with his mother and was living alone. He would meet this junior student in the library at times, and would speak to him out of curiosity, and thus did he meet the Haravatat genius Alhaitham. But time would go on to prove that wishful thinking alone does not make friends. For Kaveh quickly realized that Alhaitham, though two years his junior and admittedly both extremely talented and incredibly gifted, was also utterly different from him, whether it be in personality, dealing with people, academic direction, and convictions.\nKaveh's time in school would leave him with a great many memories, the least pleasant of which is the group project they undertook together. Each recognized the other's ability, and they decided to conduct research regarding ancient structures, ancient runes, and linguistics, with Kaveh suggesting that Alhaitham be the one responsible for selecting the topic. At first, others would take also take part in the cooperative project, but as the work progressed, the other students dropped out gradually as they could not keep up. That was the first time Kaveh realized the brutal and all-too-intuitive difference in talent between individuals. The Akademiya linked talent and resources to an extreme degree, and all here knew that. As Alhaitham liked to put it, certain matters have their upper limit determined by talent and their lower bound determined by hard work. Ordinary people and geniuses would be separated by various practical realities, and they did not have to force themselves to fit into a group they did not belong to. Kaveh, however, was resolute in his belief that this was all the result of obstacles that appeared during the process, and that wisdom should be uncovered by many people. To prevent the other students from backing out, Kaveh spent much time and effort helping them with their work, placing a great burden on his own shoulders. Alhaitham persisted in upholding the opposite view, believing Kaveh to be too idealistic in his ways — academia was not charity work, and temporary salvation would not change the reality of their differences in ability. Thus did discord arise between the two.\nFinally, the day came when only two people remained working on the topic: Alhaitham and Kaveh. The disputes between them accumulated to a critical mass before exploding spectacularly. Kaveh maintained that Alhaitham was too much of an egoist, that he could be much better welcomed amongst people if he would just care about helping out more often. Alhaitham for his part pointed out that Kaveh's impractical idealism was just a flight from reality, and that it would come to be a burden on his existence someday, and the source of Kaveh's altruism was naught but his inescapable sense of guilt. At that moment, more than anything else, Kaveh felt cut to the quick by someone who was his best friend. Alhaitham had seen through the reality that he had never been able to face, causing him to feel reality's bite for the first time, a feeling that made Kaveh steadfastly declare that he regretted making friends with this all-too-intelligent person.\nThe two parted ways in a single stroke. Alhaitham would remove his name from that thesis, while Kaveh would rip his copy of the thesis apart in a fury — only to put it back together with deep regret. He sensed that he would not be able to change his friend, with the reverse also being true.\nAfterwards, the two would later clash in academic journals several times, each criticizing the other's perspective. Before this, the \"Decoding the Runes and Architectural Philosophy of the Ruins of King Deshret's Civilization\" had made great progress. Its fruits on the linguistics front had filled various gaps in the grammatical logic of some ancient minor languages, allowing for the successful interpretation of many important texts. Similarly, the results achieved in architectural studies had successfully improved the load-bearing structures for some special terrain features in Sumeru, which greatly improved the lives of those living in remote regions. To encourage the project, the Akademiya had even specially designated a research site for its use. Unfortunately, lacking manpower and a united vision on the part of its primary researchers, it eventually ground to a halt.\nThis failed project became an unavoidable part of Kaveh's past. As the years passed, and he was beaten back by reality time and time again, Kaveh was forced to admit that his persistence born of wishful thinking was not always useful. It was only when he was rendered penniless that he finally understood the deeper meaning behind his friend's past words. A person who wished to ascend to the garden of heaven upon steps made of thin air would inevitably plant their feet on an empty stair and fall to their death. As a genius, Kaveh longed to belong in a crowd, subconsciously fearing separation from it — this was the difference between him and Alhaitham.\nReturning to the matter of that table in the tavern, Kaveh was deeply shocked to see Alhaitham, who was coincidentally present to purchase some alcohol, in this place. Alhaitham for his part could immediately tell that Kaveh was in a very bad way. Having been oppressed by life for too long, Kaveh completely unloaded all his woes onto his erstwhile friend right there and then. After all, there was nowhere to hide from his problems, so what use was concealing them in front of the one friend with whom he had fallen out so acrimoniously? He would lament about a great many misfortunes that had befallen him, only falling silent when they left the tavern in the dead of night, and his eyes fell upon a place in the distance that he once called home. Alhaitham, on the other hand, listened intently to Kaveh's words, and seeing through him once more, asked him a difficult question: \"How has realizing your ideals gone for you?\"\nOnly reality can force a researcher to admit that they were wrong, but Kaveh did not know what he should consider reality. He yearned for a fantasy so perfect and beautiful that none need flee it, even if the price of this dream was losing himself. He still firmly believed that his ideals were in themselves not mistaken, and that the fault lay only in the methods used to achieve them.\nPeople should not give up, for even if they are doing good in an attempt to make up for something, the results will still have meaning for some. Even if he could not enter that promised land of his ideals, that did not mean the radiance and the attraction of such a realm should be denied.\nAs for those phantasm-like realities, like how he found his homeless self living his friend's house by happenstance, or how this house, now under the Scribe's name, had been converted from that same research center the Akademiya had offered them back in the day, or how this excess academic asset would not have been turned into a residence at all after numerous transactions, had Kaveh not resolved to give it up... Or how, knowing full well that Alhaitham never did perform a good deed unconditionally, Kaveh would be plagued by guilty conscience and proactively mention helping with household chores, only to become saddled with all the domestic errands... These might be an annoyance for someone at a low point in life, but they are also proof the most unshakable part of one's past is a friend that will never change. Rationality and sensibility, language and architecture, knowledge and human feelings... Things that can never be integrated are what constitute the two sides of the mirror — indeed, of the entire world.",

Though all of us might claim to have a place in this great hall of learning, we must understand that it is people, and not knowledge, that make our world what it is. Without a vessel, knowledge shall have no home. Universal values must naturally have some merit to be named such, and denying their general meaning does not mean that minority viewpoints will arise accordingly. This is the case with aesthetics. Beauty is something objective that exists in human hearts. It will not lose its value simply because some people cannot understand it.\n\"To view oneself as some mighty vessel is to fall to the narrowness of the researcher. Know that truth has never existed for the sake of individuals. The logic of the world coexists with nature, and this will not easily change whether it is interpreted as such or not. Excessive belief in the object is self-disclosure just the same, a manifestation of a lack of confidence in the subject. Moreover, one who is sufficiently self-confident will not need to constantly use plural forms of address, such as 'we.' I alone am sufficient to sustain this position — this I can assert.\"\nPage 56: A hand-drawn sketch of the Akademiya.

            "Vision\tWhile he was still a student, Kaveh would often be busy with various projects. During this time, he would visit numerous ruins with fellow students. They were all very young at the time, and were as yet unable to descend to the heart of the tombs, but they managed to achieve significant results nonetheless.\nHowever, the study of ancient ruins comes with its risks, and they would find themselves imperiled despite their professionalism. During one such search, the student team encountered some danger, and there was a cave-in. If not for Kaveh pushing two fellow Kshahrewar students out of the tomb, they would surely have died there. As for Kaveh himself, though he also escaped with some light injuries, he could not stop his fellow students' change of heart. He believed that he was helping them achieve results, but instead most of his fellow students saw only a perceived difference in ability, and troubled by the situation, they elected to quit the project.\nKaveh knew of the objects known as \"Visions.\" He had originally thought that they would appear at moments of crisis, but he had been through one such mortal crisis already, he had not received the favor of the gods, but instead had to use all his strength to drag everyone out of the fire.\nYears later, Kaveh graduated, left the Akademiya, and threw himself into his work. He had by then ceased to think about Visions for some time, or even consider further as to what kind of people would come into possession of such an item. People said that only those with a wish could receive divine favor this way — perhaps he was just not such a person.\nEverything that happened after flowed like a stream of water, dull and unchanging. He would busy himself with design work, for a while becoming overwhelmed, with the lack of acknowledgment of the arts causing him to feel fatigued. His mother would set up a new family in Fontaine, leaving the house and her other possessions to him, her son... He could do nothing about these things, and they also felt unremarkable and unworthy of mention.\nThis persisted till the day the first version of the Palace of Alcazarzaray was destroyed by The Withering, and he was sitting upon the wreck of that building, contemplating the whole night through. Suddenly, he would resolve to boldly bet it all on chasing the dream before him, come what may. Thus did he return home and quickly hit up the relevant departments to put things in order. Coincidentally, that day was a smooth one for transactions, and Kaveh spent only half a day transferring ownership of his house, coming to possess a sum of Mora that he would later redirect into that project.\nAfter settling a host of trivial matters, Kaveh would return to the old home he had lived in for many years for the final time. He would use flatbread to place a simplified Palace of Alcazarzaray upon his plate, drizzled with sauce and yogurt, making himself a beautiful snack in the process.\nThis dish was not hard, and he had been taught to make it by his father in his youth. He had not made that dish much since his father's passing, and it was merely impulse that guided him to give it a try that day.\nThis was not his favorite dish, exactly, but a sudden bitterness stole its way up his throat when he made to smash the flatbread palace and start eating.\nWithin the shattered bread-palace lay a shimmering Vision.\nKaveh stared at it, unable to believe his eyes. It had arrived quite a few years late, but here it still lay before him, as gorgeous as some fantastic sky-realm — and thankfully, it was a lot closer to him than his ideals were."

            "About Xingqiu\tI've heard his story — he was born into a well-to-do family, but wasn't keen on the family business, so he now devotes his time to being an envoy of justice.

In addition to reviewing his own past deeds, I've been researching the other archons' modes of governance, too.

            "Character Details\tRex Lapis has brought prosperity and plenty to Liyue Harbor, and his rule and majesty have long passed into show and song, much to the delight of the people. But for someone in such proximity to a god, Keqing seems to lack the requisite respect the most.\n\"Hmph. Let's be real here, but does Morax really know everything?\"\nThe Liyue Qixing deal with the day-to-day happenings in the Harbor, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.\nWhile history has shown that following Morax's lead has been the right call, Keqing believes that humans should have their pride and that their views deserve equal consideration.\nAs such, she often advocates different opinions from Rex Lapis, and is the first to put such views into practice.\nHer radical actions have seen stellar results, but they have also attracted murmurings of opprobrium among those devoted to Rex Lapis.\nAs Keqing sees it, such opposition are the excuses of those who have grown complacent under the aegis of their deity, and who cannot consider the future of humanity of their own accord.\nBut someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and create a new path with their own hands — and the Yuheng star is determined to do her part in this endeavor.",
            "Character Story 1\tKeqing is the daughter of an illustrious Liyue family with a proud lineage, and she is better acquainted than most with the influence that Rex Lapis has over the people of Liyue.\nOnce every few years, in an almost cyclical fashion, a major reshuffle hits Liyue's economy after the Rite of Descension. Once Rex Lapis' new policies are announced, some families celebrate while others grieve.\nThe poor hope it will offer them the chance to finally make their fortunes while the wealthy pray that theirs will not be swept away in the changing tides. Rather than carefully analyzing the economic climate, merchants are more prone to making investments based on belief.\nAnd in present-day Liyue, this is a forgivable strategy: Rex Lapis is a powerful deity and he can be relied on for all things.\nBut Keqing has her reservations about all this: What if, one day, Rex Lapis stops fulfilling his duty? Then what would become of the people of Liyue?\nLiyue's present prosperity is akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.\nHowever, Keqing has been unable to garner majority support for her views. From most people's perspective, life is but a brief, insignificant moment in Liyue's long history, and there is no point in working oneself up into an existential quandary.\nThis perspective, as far as Keqing is concerned, is a lazy and cowardly one that denies there is any value at all in the existence of the human race. \"If humans really have no value,\" Keqing retorts, \"then why should we expect the gods to care about us so much?\"\nUnwilling to compromise on her beliefs, she cast her skepticism on everything — everything from Rex Lapis' loving-kindness, to the people's laziness, to the way that society runs.\nIssues affecting humans' fate should be handled by humans, and humans are more than capable of handling them with finesse.\nFinally, the day came of her now-famous speech at the Rite of Descension.\n\"Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?\"\nOn hearing these words, Rex Lapis burst into hearty laughter. But as for what exactly he was laughing about, only Rex Lapis himself knows.",
            "Character Story 2\tSome may be able to keep up with Keqing's forward-thinking ideas, but none can keep up with her pace of work.\nPerhaps in an effort to become a role model for her people, she demands of herself to work ten times harder than the average person, and she cannot abide any measure of laziness or inefficiency.\nHumans' abilities and lifespans are more limited than the gods'. This means that one has no hope of living to see the day when humans replace the gods as masters of our own universe if one allows apathy and hesitation to slow themselves down.\nBecause of this same mindset, she is never able to synchronize her work rhythm with the people around her.\nWhatever the task, she does not rest until the job is done, and when something should take half the month to resolve, she will pull out all the stops to try and get it turned around within the next 48 hours.\nAdditionally, Keqing's notion of 'completing' something is far more ambitious than simply getting it 'finished' — she will make sure that every relevant detail is tied up too. To the outside observer, she seems to be both highly efficient and a perfectionist.\nBut not everyone is as self-motivated as Keqing. No assistant she hires ever makes it past the three-month mark.\nShe has received countless remonstrations urging her to be less impatient, but she meets each one with a stern rejection.\nStill, she has, to some extent, come around to the idea that a high staff turnover is itself a manifestation of inefficiency, and made some concessions accordingly.\nToday, if you encounter an assistant of Keqing's dealing with some matter three, four, or even five years ahead of time, don't be alarmed, this is completely normal. Keqing gave them a bit of a head start, but she'll be catching up before long.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"Yesterday's experiences make me stronger today.\" This is one of the principles Keqing lives by.\nSpending all of one's time at Yujing Terrace means seeing the same old things day after day. But to be able to think and act as swiftly as lightning, one needs a huge amount of experience to draw on.\nSo, if Keqing sees something that needs doing, why, she'll do it herself. For example, she once served for two months as a laborer to better decide how to refine a plan to improve their treatment.\nIt's hard to imagine that this young lady with so much authority vested in her has pulled carts at The Chasm, rammed earth at the south wharf, and waited tables at small diners.\nIn addition to working, she also once took the opportunity to gather evidence with which to report a powerful individual known for his abuses.\nHe was apprehended without any clue as to how he had been exposed, but when he was brought to the interrogation chamber by the Millelith, there he saw a striking young lady dressed in fine robes.\n\"Hey! Haven't we... haven't we met somewhere before?\"\nThe words felt foolish the moment they rolled off his tongue, even to him.\nEspecially because the Millelith then introduced her as follows: \"This is the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Know your place and keep your distance!\"\n—Exactly, so what was he thinking!?",
            "Character Story 4\tRex Lapis' departure has put Liyue Harbor through a great deal of hardship. All the duties Rex once fulfilled have been taken up by the Qixing and the Eight Trades.\nNow that divine rule is a thing of the past, the old strictures left behind can't simply be continued wholesale. But to establish new laws for Liyue, whose history spans several thousand years, is no mean feat.\nAt first, Keqing was incredibly enthusiastic about this task, having long prepared for this day when she might finally show her mettle. But several months in, and she was still stuck on a single task, land infrastructure — and it was driving her up the wall.\nNo matter how hard she struggled, the mountain of tasks was like a quagmire. She was making difference, yes, but not nearly with as much ease as Rex Lapis.\n\"Why can I only do this much? Why... can't I do it better?\"\nOf course, she had long understood the wherefores here.\nHer lack of respect for gods had somehow received their recognition all the same, yes, but that didn't mean that she was ready to simply replace them.\nBut she was still Keqing, resolute and tenacious.\nFrom that day on, she shut herself in, studying classics of various kinds to learn all that she needed. Placing herself lowest, she accepted all that she had hitherto not known with open arms.\nDuring this period, she gained a certain calm, slowly discarding the \"opprobrium\" she had long held against Rex Lapis.\nThey were both working for the good of Liyue, after all — and two people who love the same thing need not be on opposing sides.\nShe also seemingly came to an understanding concerning the smile Rex Lapis had given her during that Rite of Descension. It was, Keqing now believes, an expression of acknowledgment and expectation.\nShe hasn't lost any of her forceful and decisive manner, no. But sometimes, when she feels lost, she will stop and think: \"What would Rex Lapis do at a moment such as this?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tKeqing, who has dedicated a large portion of her energies to Liyue Harbor, indulges in an unexpected pastime when she can spare a moment — shopping.\nOn her days off, she changes into ordinary clothes, contacts a few close friends, and enjoys a day of strolling around Feiyun Slope and Chihu Rock, just enjoying the act of buying things.\nAfter Rex Lapis' departure, Keqing managed to maintain this method of decompression despite her busier schedule, though with one subtle difference.\nOn one of her shopping trips, she happened upon a small and unremarkable stall that sold cute Rex Lapis clay figurines with tiny bodies and big heads.\nPersuading her friends to visit the silk store opposite, she approached the stall, took a figurine in her hand, and began to examine it.\nShe knew that she didn't have much time. So, after glancing around to make sure that no one was watching, she paid for, picked up, and packed away her prize in one swift single movement.\nBut no sooner had she placed the figurine into her bag and heaved a sigh of relief than one of her friends, silk bundles in tow, tapped her on the shoulder.\nIn the end, all was revealed. Her friends were quite curious: Wasn't Keqing a skeptic among skeptics? Why would she buy one of these?\n\"For... For introspection, of course! There's nothing wrong with self-reflection, is there?\"\nSo she said, and it would be convincing, too — if Keqing didn't already have an entire shelf dedicated to Rex Lapis self-reflection memorabilia...",
            "Survival Hairpin\tThough she is of noble birth, Keqing tries to keep her luxuries to the bare minimum that would befit her position as one of the Liyue Qixing.\nAnd when she is outside the borders of the prosperous city, she will often head deep into uninhabited areas to strengthen her knowledge and sharpen her will.\nShe has experienced countless challenges, but unlike backpackers and adventurers, she does not bring anything with but her hairpin and her sword.\nAs long as it is infused with Electro, a hairpin can become a knife of unmatched sharpness. Cutting grass, chopping firewood, skinning game, and carving bone are all well within its capabilities.\nIf faced with a drop of great height, she only needs to pin it into the ground, tie rattans to it, and rappel down.\nIt also serves as an incredibly sensitive security device when camping out. Any unusual movements nearby will cause it, when tipped over and placed perpendicular to the ground, to alert and awaken Keqing immediately.\nIt can even be used to fish: Keqing just hurls it into the water when she's feeling peckish, and there will always be a few fish that will get knocked out by the electric shock — and of course, finding a stick to grill the fish on is not a problem either.\nSome narrow-minded folk have ridiculed Keqing's hairpin for being old and worn, but this does not anger her. Indeed, she considers it a point of pride.\n\"Its weathered form is what gives it its charm.\"",
            "Vision\tKeqing is likely a skeptic without equal when it comes to the value of Visions.\nShe knows that everything she has is the result of her own hard work, but that in the eyes of others, credit has been given instead to her Vision.\nShe once believed that this purple crystal had stolen the pride due originally to her, and that it was both a challenge and an insult from the gods.\nIn fact, she has tried to destroy her Vision countless times — she's left it in a huge fire for three days and three nights, run over it with a minecart full of rocks, and has even hurled it from the heights of the Jade Chamber.\nUnfortunately, she has never been successful.\nWith no options left, and not wanting it to fall into the wrong hands, Keqing was forced to accept the Vision as part of her life.\nOver time, Keqing came to appreciate her Vision. She realized that this item did not actually have any divine will imbued within it, and that it also had numerous practical uses. Thus, she decided to make use of it.\n\"The source of power is far less important than the character of its user.\"\nRegardless of how she may once have regarded it, Keqing's Vision and its powers have become a part of her.\nThank the Archons she hadn't destroyed it back then, or she'd have regretted it for sure — oh, the hardships of being a pragmatist."

By the time they wake up in their sick beds, they have nothing further to say, because they've forgotten whatever it was they were fighting about.",
            "About Xilonen\tI saw a strange job posting once while passing by the Children of Echoes' territory. The requester was looking for a hardy plant that wouldn't take much maintenance, so I brought over some Saurian claw succulent seeds, along with a pot and some fertilizer. It grows well all over Natlan, even in the most barren areas. But when I went to collect my payment, I saw that not a single seedling had sprouted from the pot.\nI paid the price for overestimating Xilonen's gardening skills. This was one of the few failed jobs on my record.",
            "About Iansan\tKinich: I've taken jobs from her before. More of a long-term collaboration, really... She makes fitness meals for her personal-training students, with everything measured out to the exact calorie. To keep this up, she needs a steady supply of fruits that meet her strict quality standards and size requirements. A single bruise or bug bite, and she'll reject the entire batch. Most people find this impossible to work with, but I've got a good eye for these things... plus a reliable means of disposal for fruits that don't make the grade.\nAjaw: Wait, what? ...THAT'S what you make my juice from!?",

Not to pry into my clients' private affairs, but... don't the Masters of the Night-Wind use woven fabric instead of paper?",
            "About Ifa\tKinich: I've enlisted his services before. It was when Ajaw said he was \"ill\"... Whatever it was, he was ranting and crying incessantly. So, I figured it only made sense to take him to the best sauro-vet I could find. And he really is a pro. Ajaw wasn't inside for long, but when Ifa brought him out, he was cured.\nAjaw: Gah... What do you know about medicine! He's not even a real doctor, he's a quack! A charlatan! ...You weren't even there, you don't know what he said! Ugh.",

            "More About Kinich: IV\tKinich: Ajaw used to be sealed in an ancient ruin, up until I signed a contract with him and let him out.\nAjaw: I took him for a reckless moron who'd be dead in a ditch within days, but nooooo! Somehow, he's still here, alive and kicking... Ugh, rise above it, rise above it. I am the sovereign ruler of the nation of flame, and I have the virtue and dignity to match.\nKinich: Your \"virtue and dignity\" is what makes you hope I kick the bucket every day?\nAjaw: I meant time and patience!\nKinich: ...Anyway, as long as you know how to keep them under your thumb, even the most vile and wretched beings have their utility.\nAjaw: Get stuffed, Kinich!

But I'm also the bearer of the Turnfire legacy, and I'm prepared to face the flames when that day comes.\nLet the Turnfire judge how I have spent my life. I know I won't have anything to regret.",
            "Kinich's Hobbies\tI've tried my hand at all kinds of extreme sports. When I get bored of one thing, I move onto the next. It's a good way to hone your skills while learning to control your fear... First, you face your fear, then you learn to tolerate it, and finally, you conquer it.",

            "Least Favorite Food\tAjaw: Cold or spicy food defaces the sacred temple that is our body, and steaming hot oil is a noxious gas that we avoid like the plague. Nothing too hard, as it is laborious to chew — nor too soft, for it lacks flavor...\nKinich: So tell me. What do you want?\nAjaw: To feast on your soul! Muahahaha!",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tKinich: This is quite delicious. I should offer you some cash in return, or some kind of gift if you'd prefer.\nAjaw: Spit it out, you greedy snake! Some of that was meant for me!",

A ride through the skies on the back of the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw is a once-in-a-lifetime honor.\nKinich: Don't worry, it's just a gentle cruise through the forest. Just follow me.

            "Character Details\tNatlan is a nation where humans and Saurians live side-by-side, and this mutualism has lasted for many years.\nSuch relationships are for the most part friendly, with humans and Saurians as bosom companions.\nBut this does not mean that all Saurians approach humans with friendly intent. Even today, quite a few deaths still occur due to Saurian attacks.\nThis is why Saurian Hunters — of which Kinich happens to be a leading member — exist, deeply familiar with the weaknesses of Saurians as they are.\nHe is of no great age, nor has he been trained by any great master, but through many years of living out in the wild, he has learned the techniques by which he subdues wild beasts and wicked Saurians alike.\nLike a natural born hunter, he is steady, direct, and efficient, watching his prey with a gaze as sharp as a boning knife.\nBut unlike other Saurian Hunters, Kinich is far from limited by this profession. Rumor has it that for the right price, he will also prove himself to be adept at wet work.\nIt is because of this that many in the tribe keep a distance from him — though of course, some also do so on account of his realistic, utilitarian approach to life.\nRegardless of whom he receives his commission from, even if they're a person in a bind, or still a child, he will always request the remuneration he deems suitable.\nNothing can change this belief of his — that all things come at a cost. Such actions provoke confusion, but Kinich has no intention of explaining himself.\nIf you must have an explanation, you can get one, but only after he sticks out an open palm and asks: \"And what price are you willing to pay for that?\"",
            "Character Story 1\tBefore he was seven, Kinich lived with his family.\nHis father was a courier who took three days off for every one day of work, and made a pastime out of taking his day's wages to the betting tables, seeking to make far more than he wagered.\nIf he won, he would bring Kinich a box of expensive sweets, and hand-pick lovely flowers for his wife.\nIf he lost, he would borrow some money from a colleague to get himself drunk, all the better to cover up his utter lack of earnings or winnings.\nBut Kinich's mother remained lucid, and would argue with him constantly while holding the little Kinich. At times, the man would admit his fault, promising to never gamble again.\nBut other times, a kitchenware-shattering domestic war would break out, in which the victor would invariably be Kinich's father, stronger in body as he was, with his defeated mother left to quietly tend to the crops they grew in their backyard—\nThis resilient woman was not adept at fighting, but was an excellent farmer. And just as well, too, for there were three mouths to feed in that house.\nNot long afterward, Kinich's father would go on to lose their house, forcing them to move to the foot of a mountain, far from their tribe.\nThis arrangement was not without its benefits, for it did come with a larger plot of land. Here, Kinich learned to plant Grainfruit, twist castor oil plants into rope, mix tapioca flour to make thick noodles, and learn the art of trap-making to hunt for forest boars.\nBut the ills were more evident, for any violence here had no hope of neighborly mediation, the injuries he and his mother would suffer contingent only on his father's state of drunkenness.\nOne night, his mother snuck out and left without making the slightest noise, leaving her young son behind, perhaps for fear that her husband might pursue her to the ends of the earth otherwise.\nKinich does not recall if she said goodbye to him, but nonetheless, he ably succeeded her housework, farmwork, hunting-craft, and beatings.\nAs he grew, however, Kinich gradually found means of escape. His athleticism proved exceptional, and as he grew faster each day, his father grew less able to catch him.\nEach time he all but flew out the door, the wind would briefly conceal his father's enraged yells, granting him a rare moment of freedom.\nAnd perhaps fate itself had pity on him, for he was soon to experience true freedom. On his seventh birthday, for the very first time, he asked his father if he had news of his mother.\nNo words were needed for the answer to present itself. His father pursued him, eyes shot through with hangover red, aiming to give him a piece of his mind... But long years of drinking had left the man's body with a shadow of its former strength. As the chase led them past a precipice, he lost his footing by mistake, plummeting off the cliff.\nBy the time Kinich had reacted, the man with whom he had lived for many years lay at the bottom of a col, unmoving as a forest boar tired of struggling in a snare. He would never again get up.\nThe first thing Kinich felt was a daze, almost like being snow-blind, before a staggering sourness knocked him out of that torpid haze.\nOnly by squeezing his eyes shut, scrunching his nose, and breathing deeply, warping and twisting his face in the process, did he manage to hold in the tears.\nAfter some time, he knew not how long, he picked up his father's grappling hook and dragged the man's stiffened body back home.\nHis father had never taught him how to use such equipment, but Kinich had learned just by watching in secret a few times. Now, he blitzed past one tree branch after another, the wind whizzing in his ears.\nOn his seventh birthday, the mountains had sent him the gift of freedom — but when he opened the box, he found naught but solitude within.",
            "Character Story 2\tAfter his parents' successive departures, Kinich would continue living beneath that mountain.\nHe lived thus: planting, weaving, hunting, going to the tribal market to exchange his quarry for other necessities.\nAs time passed, this silent lad would make a deeper impression on the adults of the tribal assembly.\nSome were worried that he might have difficulty living, and so attempted to provide help, only to be rejected by a shake of his head.\nAs little Kinich saw things, nothing in this world was free, and seen in that light, free help was far more suspicious than goods with openly stated prices.\nIt could be bait, like that which he incorporated into his hunting traps, revealing its hidden cost only later.\nAnd so, he would conscientiously drift along the edges of the tribe, keeping all who approached him at arm's length.\nEach time he came to the tribe, he would simply trade for the things he needed, then depart right away, never tarrying for long.\nAll this was witnessed by Elder Leik, who was in charge of teaching the children.\nHaving interacted with the boy's parents while dealing with the matter of child education in the Scions of the Canopy, he was one of the few people familiar with Kinich's family circumstances.\nAnd so, he proposed a special transaction to the boy when he visited the market.\nHe wanted Kinich to attend the tribe's Learning Lodge, for children of the tribe who were seven to eight years old should all attend school.\nAs for fees, he could run errands in lieu of payment, for Leik needed a courier to deliver impromptu notices to the students.\nHowever, Kinich rejected the offer all the same, for he was too young to understand the value of education, and he could hunt seven or even eight forest boars in the time it took to run the errands — hardly a good trade.\nLeik was quite dumbfounded, for in truth the Learning Lodge's lessons came free, and he had only proposed the errands to dispel Kinich's vigilance.\nStill, the Elder did not give up, spending a whole month explaining the nature of the Lodge to the boy, all the while adjusting the remuneration.\nAt last, they came to an accord. Each time he came to the markets, Kinich would also go to school, in exchange for serving as the Elder's messenger whenever he was free.\nThis trade proved satisfactory to both parties — though neither of them expected that Kinich would require but a single day to graduate.",
            "Character Story 3\tElder Leik happened to be teaching the day that Kinich showed up to school as agreed. The Elder stood at the center of a circle of seated students and motioned for Kinich to find a place to sit.\nKinich sat at the circle's outer edge, the other kids looking him up and down inquisitively. The Scions of the Canopy lived simply for the most part, but even amongst them, Kinich was shabbily dressed.\nBarefoot, he wore an ash-stained headband, a coarse handmade linen shirt, and an animal-skin skirt, making him look like a wild child indeed.\n\"Why don't you wear shoes?\" A young girl called out. \"Because he's a muddy monkey from the forest,\" jeered a strong-looking lad and his friends.\nElder Leik immediately coughed to interrupt them and signal that class was about to start.\n\"Now, children, today we shall speak of our heroes and their sagas. Can anyone tell me their names?\"\n\"'Malipo' Burkina!\" \"Master Yupanqui!\" ... The answers rolled forth from the children in waves.\n\"That's right. Every one of our heroes deserves to be remembered, not only for their strength, but also for their spirit of self-sacrifice.\"\nAt this moment, Kinich raised his hand from where he sat, furthest beyond the circle. \"Why would they want to sacrifice themselves?\"\n\"There is no particular why or wherefore. That is simply a virtue innate to heroes,\" the Elder replied. \"And what did this virtue get them in return?\" Kinich asked again.\n\"Virtue is a thing beyond price. It cannot be exchanged for anything, for it is a reward from the heavens.\"\n\"A reward?\" Kinich's doubts had not been assuaged. \"What sort of reward, exactly? Fame? Mora?\"\n\"All these, of course, but they were not the key. The key is virtue itself, for it is the basis of noble character, and that is what makes a hero a hero.\"\nThe old scholar closed his book and gave Kinich an earnest look, though the boy had not particularly understood this statement. Instead, he was thinking back on the past—\nThe mountains told him that the forest boar was the noblest of things, for it could fill his stomach. The next noblest was water, for without it, humans would die of thirst.\nBut neither of these were his birthright, and that made them precious. Thus, when he gave them up, he would seek something in return.\nMora was the \"something\" he preferred best, for it could be exchanged for many other things.\nAnd so he told Elder Leik, \"If I become a hero, I want to be rewarded with Mora.\"\nHow the other children laughed then, the boy who had mocked Kinich foremost amongst them. \"Why don't you go back and swing in your trees then, selfish mud monkey?\"\nBut his little gang was not satisfied with just this. Standing up, they squeezed Kinich out the door. Though Elder Leik tried to stop them, Kinich took the opportunity to leave all the same. He felt no need to stay there any longer, for his keen mind had caught onto a certain truth—\nThese noisy brats in the Lodge were just that — brats. As they gathered to heap praise upon the heroes, it must have seemed to them that they had become the companions of those heroes, sharing in their nobility. But such false glory would not teach them how to fill their tummies. Once school was over, every single one of them would have to return home and be fed by their mothers.\nKinich could have taught them a lesson right there, too. Laid a couple out for half a month or so, just to let them know how far they were from being heroes.\nBut what use was there in giving out free life lessons... emphasis on \"free\"?\nStill, this class was not an entirely fruitless endeavor. If nothing else, he now had some answers to his doubts.\nHe knew what he must do in the future. Become a hero — for the Mora, that is.",
            "Character Story 4\tA hero needs to be strong, that much cannot be contested. Not long after he graduated from the Learning Lodge, he would seek Elder Leik out on his own to suggest how he might gain this strength.\nTo secure the Elder's approval, he even brought all he owned, hoping that it might constitute a worthy price:\nGrappling hooks and trap-making equipment, freshly-harvested castor beans, two large pots of tapioca flour, a bag of Grainfruit seeds, a freshly-slaughtered forest boar, and a small amount of Mora.\nThe Elder laughed and rejected Kinich's offer of remuneration, on one condition, that Kinich learn what it truly meant to be a hero on his journey.\nIn truth, the Elder had always cherished high hopes for the boy, for he could see a reflection of the ancient heroes within him.\nAt the same time, he believed that Kinich required proper guidance, for should he set out on the wrong path, he could do far greater damage than your average villain. Thus, a new trade was agreed upon.\nIn this way, Kinich would live alongside Elder Leik in the mountains and forests for many years.\nAnd even as the Elder taught Kinich about the history of Natlan and the heroes of its various tribes, he would also recommend many notables to the lad.\nA fletcher who made special arrowheads, a witch doctor specializing in Saurian poisons, an old hunter skilled in the use of ropes and grappling hooks, an expert in escape and evasion from dire situations...\nKinich would never reject such expertise, and learned much from them day and night, but this alone did not satisfy him, and on designated rest days, he would return to the mountains to hone his combat skills.\nWithout a formal teacher in this regard, he would imitate the motions of wild animals as they hunted. Some were agile, others cunning, and others fierce, and so he took their strengths and incorporated them into his own unique martial arts.\nAs his abilities grew, Elder Leik would also guide Kinich to take on more duties within the tribe, beginning with courier work.\nKinich proved skilled at this beyond even many adults, doing all that they could in half the time.\nWith his skills, it was no surprise that people would gradually come to him, offering payment in exchange for more dangerous services, including the slaying of powerful Saurians.\nThe Elder initially assumed that Kinich might come to ask his opinion, but not once did this happen.\nIn this regard, the young man was like a veteran of over ten years, always able to judge the merits of any commission and negotiate suitable payment.\nAnd when there was falsehood or concealment involved in such commissions, Kinich would forcefully weigh the cost upon the scales of his heart and adjust the price accordingly, regardless of whether the other party might refuse.\nSuch behavior, of course, led to some criticism, and there were important folk even within the tribe who felt that Kinich did not give his work enough care.\nBut the young man would never explain himself, simply continuing to set the prices he saw fit for each assignment he was given.\nEven Elder Trinidad, who had charge over ritual matters, took issue with this at one point, and sought to summon the lad for questioning. However, Elder Leik stopped him.\n\"Come now, no need for all this fuss. The lad knows what he's doing.\"\n\"It's preposterous! The Scions of the Canopy have never called any such person a hero!\"\n\"And that's where you're mistaken. He has never been a Scion of the Canopy. He is a scion of the mountains — the only sort of hero he will become is the sort he wishes to be.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tIt may seem strange that Kinich, loner that he is, goes nowhere without a certain self-proclaimed \"K'uhul Ajaw\" — meaning \"Divine Lord\" — hanging around him.\nAccording to reliable research by the Saurian Relics Association, Ajaw is a bona fide relic from the era of dragons, dating back several millennia.\nHis true form has been sealed within an enigmatic engraved wristband, his current one being a mere projection via phlogiston.\nConsidering his great age and intelligence, the Association researchers believe Ajaw to have immense research value, and have attempted to purchase him for a more than hefty price.\nHowever, Kinich is well-aware that Ajaw is all too intelligent, has an all-round awful personality, and poses an immense threat, and has thus rejected them without hesitation.\nHe knows that Ajaw is, without a doubt, dangerous — arrogant, cunning, chaotic, and wicked.\nIndeed, were he to hand the relic over to the Association, the organization's very existence might soon be in jeopardy.\nBut there is a more direct reason behind Kinich's refusal to hand Ajaw over — they have signed an unbreakable pact.\nAll this goes back to an ancient dragon ruin that was rumored to contain a \"secret draconic treasure.\" It was unearthed due to an earthquake, and before long, had attracted much attention.\nAfter more than a few initial surveying parties were lost, however, any interested parties that were still remaining began to wise up.\nAt this time, Kinich was already a Saurian Hunter of some repute, and thus was invited by one such team to join.\nIt was only after they had entered that they found the place teeming with monsters and mechanisms, discovering that it was far more perilous than the rumors had suggested.\nSome died, others were wounded, and others still fell back, until at last only Kinich reached the ruin's depths.\nAnd that was where he encountered the ancient being, K'uhul Ajaw, who had been sealed away.\nHe immediately sensed the wickedness in the other party's voice, but also realized that its power might be useful even so.\nAs for Ajaw, he had his own schemes. Having been sealed here in this blasted hovel for countless years, he longed to see the sun once more.\nAnd so, after several days of mutual testing that was at times friendly, other times hostile, but always brimming with intrigue...\nEach had the other's measure, and so a contract was signed, a pact struck.\nThe mysterious life-form that called himself \"K'uhul Ajaw\" would henceforth heed Kinich's commands, and lend the former a share of his strength, in accordance to their contract, on a temporary, limited, conditional basis, and in restricted amounts.\nIn exchange, Kinich would take Ajaw out to see the outside world, and upon his passing, his body would be Ajaw's to take for his own use.",
            "\"The Hill of Silent Crickets\"\tKinich has read a great number of Elder Leik's collected books and woven scrolls while studying in the latter's home.\nSome he has simply skimmed the title pages of, but others, he has read over and over.\nStill, none of them compare to \"The Hill of Silent Crickets,\" which he even recommended to the Elder.\nAfter reading it, the old scholar stated that its prose was rough-hewn, its narrative plain, and its imagination lacking — and most importantly, it was an unfinished manuscript.\nKinich was dumbfounded for a moment, but it did not change his love for the text, for its writer had been his mother.\nThe draft depicted a cricket species that lived underground. There they lived out their entire lives, before climbing up to the surface to mate before dying.\nThus did they live for generations, until one day, a great upheaval shook the under-earth, and the soil temperature surged, killing off the crickets in their droves.\nThe remaining survivors chose to hide by burrowing ever deeper — all save the protagonist, a champion amongst crickets who chose instead to climb back up to the surface.\nIt wished to know what had transpired above, and see if there was some way to resolve this crisis.\nBut when it emerged, it found that the once-verdant mountains had been rendered desolate by the war between humans and monsters.\nPlants had withered, the earth was scorched, and drifting ash blotted out the sun, the air now choked with phlogiston, deadly poison to cricket-kind — for this was the land that in latter days would be called the Mare Jivari.\nThe cricket hero, filled with resentment, fell to the blackened ground, but as its life's spark faded, it used up the last of its strength to lay a single cracked crystal egg ...\nThe story ends abruptly here, with none ever knowing if a little cricket might come forth from that egg, and that was the key reason for Elder Leik's low opinion of the tale.\nYet that was exactly why Kinich liked it — for it meant that he could look forward to the day when he might see the ending of this manuscript.",
            "Vision\tEven after obtaining his Ancient Name, Kinich made no promises that he would follow the example of the historical heroes in sacrificing himself for the many.\nHe simply took part in that Night Warden War without a word, and threw himself into the jaws of the glorious death that awaited him without hesitation.\nThat was a perilous battle indeed, with the Abyss's power having taken on a new and vile twist, now wearing the shape of those near and dear to the warriors, and ambushing them thus.\nUp against familiar faces, the warriors began to hesitate one by one, and though they did so only for an instant, that was enough to spell their defeat and fatal doom.\nKinich too encountered this dilemma, for the one standing before him was his mother, just as he remembered her.\nHe had once thought to himself, should he ever meet her again, he would first ask her how \"The Hill of Silent Crickets\" ended.\nBut in that moment, his hunter's instincts proved swifter than his mind, for no sooner had the Abyssal entity masqued as his mother spread its arms to embrace him than his blade ran it clean through.\nFollowing that, he proved all the more merciless in cleaving each \"familiar face\" that followed — yet not truly in cold blood, for each mortal swing of his sword was as another weight on his heart.\nHe simply understood that only victory could bring back all the fallen now, and each sacrificed comrade steeled his blade still further.\nBut the monstrosities came on as though a swarm of ravenous locusts, and the warriors had already taken serious losses in the previous surprise attack.\nAnd so they fell, until Kinich at last found himself the last person standing, his vision clouded by blood, and his body savaged by wounds; yet still the monsters pressed in.\nHe knew that this was the end of the line, and that was also the first time he heard dignified solemnity in Ajaw's voice:\n\"I fear this is as much power as is mine to display, Kinich...\"\n\"But I swear on my name, K'uhul Ajaw, that upon my accession to your form, you shall all be avenged.\"\nHearing this, Kinich laughed out loud, a rarity for him, and with laughter did he raise his great blade, cutting down yet another few creatures as they drew near.\nAll the same, he was utterly spent, and his guard grew ever sloppier, until one monstrous claw ran his chest through from the rear.\nSlumping over, Kinich could see fresh blood spurting from the wound as he looked slowly down, but still his feet staggered on, eager to slay another monster.\nCrimson droplets meandered across the ground behind him, their trail composing his finale. At last, his body sank to its knees. He could do no more. The final bar line had been inked.\nKinich, last of the Night Warden warriors, was slain.\nAjaw closed his eyes to give the fallen their due respect... only to open them to a stunning sight.\nKinich's fallen form had risen, his hands, just now bloodless and white, gripping his claymore tightly.\nThus did \"Kinich\" plunge into the Abyssal tide once more, his tireless blade flashing across the battlefield...\nRecovering from the shock, Ajaw looked closely, and lo! A heart-patterned, emerald-hued gem now hung where Kinich's chest had been pierced — though when it had appeared, he knew not.\nFrom it flowed vibrant life, driving Kinich's unconscious form on, transforming him into an indefatigable beast of instinct, tearing into the monsters until every last one was no more...\n...\nWhen Kinich next opened his eyes, he found himself back at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, people all around singing the searing Ode of Resurrection.\nHe turned to see his comrades, bathed in streaming song, awakening one by one.\n\"We... won? But who...\" Kinich mumbled, grabbing at his chest. He was so sure that he had fallen before the forces of the Abyss.\nBut someone must have intervened to grant them victory, for otherwise, the Ode would not have revived them.\n\"What claptrap are you spouting? You did it, you demented, hard-scrabbling, lucky little grasshopper!\" Ajaw, splayed out on the floor and clearly frustrated, threw a stone his way. \"Bah! Was gaining my succor insufficient for you? Clearly! And now you've gone and gotten a Vision... Oh, when will your body be mine to use!?\"\n...\nThe night he was given new life, Kinich leaned back on his bed, running his fingers over his emerald Vision.\nSights flashed before his eyes. The crowd swarming him, the thunderous applause, the sacred, burning Ode of Resurrection...\nIt came to him then, out of the blue, that he had deviated from his original goal.\nHe had struck out to become a hero for Mora's sake, but now, he fought for something far more precious.\nHis comrades, his homeland, the laughter and joy of the people... He knew not when this process had begun. Indeed, the seeds of change may have been sown long before.\n\"We remember our heroes not only for their strength, but for their spirit of self-sacrifice...\"\n\"That is a virtue innate to heroes...\" \"For it is the basis of noble character, and that is what makes a hero a hero.\"\nKinich faintly recalled Elder Leik's first lesson. He did not think himself more noble, or more self-sacrificial than he had been then.\nWhat he was, however, was surer that he was willing to pay any price to obtain what he now wanted."

            "Chat: Packages\tI wonder what's inside this package... No no no, no peeking at my customer's stuff...",
            "Chat: Orders\tLet me see... Okay, let's get going. The next location on my list is really far away.",
            "Chat: Work\tWhoa, the scenery here is wonderful. Hehe, I've landed the perfect job.",
            "When It Rains\tAgh...! Now my fur's all wet. Do you want a box to hide in too?",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tMeeoww! Phew... I almost forgot how to speak like a human...",
            "When It Snows\tIt's so cold, my tails are turning into ice pops... I should've stayed inside near the fireplace. My fur won't get singed as long as I don't get too close to it, right?",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tThe sunlight feels really cozy. Napping in a tree would be nice... Ohh, just the thought of it is making me sleepy.",
            "When the Wind Is Blowing\tOh no! The smaller parcels are gonna get blown away!",
            "In the Desert\tSand's getting wedged into my paw pads... Feels kinda weird...",
            "Good Morning\tGood morning! I saw that you hadn't woken up yet, so I went out and got you some food. Oh, don't worry, there aren't any squirrels or finches in it. Even though they're delicious too...",
            "Good Afternoon\t*yawn* Let me sleep a little longer... I can't even lift my tails right now...",
            "Good Evening\tGood evening, I'm all ready to head out. Huh? What do you mean it's time for bed? Nighttime's when I'm the most alive! I can travel faster and see better, and there are fewer people on the road, too.",
            "Good Night\tGood night, sweet dreams! That said, without two tails to bother you at night, I'm sure you have sweet dreams all the time.",
            "About Kirara: Paw Pads\tMy boots? Oh, they're my paws, actually. I can use my youkai powers to turn them into human feet, but I feel way more at ease walking with my claws and paw pads. Um, don't touch them, please! They're ticklish!",
            "About Kirara: Name\tGranny named me Kirara. Back when I still had only one tail, Granny would give me head pats and chin scratches and tell me how bright and pretty my eyes were.",
            "About Us: Journey\tYou travel far and wide, and I deliver packages all across the world. That makes us similar, don't you think? But although we both travel from one place to the next, my travel expenses are covered, while you have to pay for everything out of pocket... Huh? N—No! I didn't mean to brag!",
            "About Us: Encounters\tI've met all sorts of people through delivery work. Some have become regulars of Komaniya Express, while others have become my friends... and I feel so lucky for that. Each delivery ends with the package reaching its destination, but our bonds with each other live on. If you ask me, friendships between youkai and humans aren't all that difficult to form.",
            "About the Vision\tI still remember the first time I tried shape-shifting into human form using my youkai powers, thrilled at the thought of finally being able to experience the human world for myself. And before I knew it, my Vision had appeared at my waist. Hmm... Did this god have a profound desire to travel to all sorts of places, too?",
            "Something to Share: Hunting\tWeapons forged by humans aren't bad at all, but I'd rather rely on my feline instincts sometimes. I mean, when there's a little finch right before your eyes, don't you just want to creep up from behind, crouch really low on the ground, wait for the right moment... then pounce right on it? Not even successful package deliveries can compare with the satisfaction I get from hunting down prey!",
            "Something to Share: Box\tGranny told me that this was my favorite box to sleep in when I was little. Hehe, it's kinda funny — back then, all I knew about Komaniya Express was that their boxes were big and comfy, and if you'd told me that one day, I'd make a living out of giving all their boxes away to other people, I'd have never believed you. Hehe, although it is definitely more of a squeeze trying to fit inside their boxes these days... What? What do you mean, all the stuff in there already...? Ugh, no, I mean their empty boxes! I'd never open a customer's parcel!",
            "Interesting Things: Tree Houses\tDid you know that some houses in Sumeru are built atop trees? Oh, it'd be so nice to bathe in sunlight all day without having to climb down for food. Huh? You already knew? Okay then... do you also happen to know how they're built? I have claws and all, and even so, I felt really exhausted climbing up one of those tall trees to deliver a package. How were the building materials and furniture delivered up there when the people of Sumeru didn't even have claws to begin with... I don't get it...",
            "Interesting Things: Big Houses\tI got to see lots of big houses while delivering packages, ones that were even bigger than Granny's house! Palace this, temple that... And there were countless smaller rooms in each of them. Wouldn't living in such a huge place make you feel a little empty inside, though? Having a place to eat in the morning, a place to sunbathe at noon, and a little box to rest in at night is more than enough for me. Huh. Does that mean big houses are just larger boxes for humans?",
            "About Yae Miko\tLady Miko is a widely renowned kitsune youkai in Inazuma, so it's natural for young youkai like myself to approach her with reverence. But contrary to my expectations, she was surprisingly amiable. She even came to visit me in person and taught me lots of useful stuff about how to survive in human society! Things like proper human etiquette, ways to approach people, and different fried tofu recipes... Huh? That last one was just for her?",
            "About the Raiden Shogun\tParcels sent to Tenshukaku are all packaged intricately with multiple layers of wrapping. Maybe that's what they call a package fit for the Almighty Shogun. Some of them smell really good... I wonder what's inside.",
            "About Shikanoin Heizou\tI crossed paths with that detective a long while back. Once he learned that I was a nekomata, he started asking me to investigate the whereabouts of missing cats. I was happy to help at first, but then I'd hear the cats say things like \"I just want to see the outside world!\" or \"I get so bored when I'm at home,\" I felt bad for them. So I lied, telling him that I hadn't seen any cat at all. But it seemed like he could see right through me...",
            "About Kujou Sara\tI've always wanted to have a chat with the Lady Tengu. Maybe it's because she's the general of the Tenryou Commission, but I find her quite intimidating, so I've only ever watched her from afar. I—I'm just curious about her wings, you know? Are they ever an inconvenience? How does she deal with shedding feathers? Mm... Speaking of the feathers, I think lining my box with them would be super comfy.",
            "About Arataki Itto\tHe's an oni, but he gets along with humans perfectly — he even has his own gang! Oh, I'm so jealous. Maybe I should go ask him for some advice.",
            "About Lyney\tSo I met this magician in Fontaine who could make anything disappear, then make it reappear out of thin air! He must've used some kind of youkai power to make that happen, right? Hmm... Is he a youkai too, then?",
            "About Chiori\tShe's really nice to me. I often ran into her in the past when she was out researching ways to make fabrics and develop color palettes. She was always worried that I'd leave claw marks all over her beautiful textiles, but come on, why would I do that to her? She's running a store in Fontaine now and sometimes asks me to deliver stuff to her. Hehe, she even helped me tailor the clothes I'm wearing now.",
            "More About Kirara: I\tGranny told me many stories when I was a little kitten. About the youkai of Inazuma, the festivals held in the city, the delicacies of other nations... I would curl up on her lap and listen until I fell asleep. Even now, I still can't tell which parts of the stories were real, and which were a part of my dreams...",
            "More About Kirara: II\tBeing a courier is the perfect job for me. The Lady Kitsune told me that those who don't work can't fit into human society, and I'm not having any of that! That's why I've decided to take every delivery seriously. I—I'm not going back to the boonies, even if it means I get to be a Great Youkai or whatever!",
            "More About Kirara: III\tMaybe it's because I look like an easy target, but I often run into bandits when I'm on the road — but I always manage to chase them off! I don't go all out, though, because if the company was held liable for the injuries I caused... Well, I'd get canned!",
            "More About Kirara: IV\tWhenever I set foot in a new city, I always climb somewhere high up and gaze down at the scenery. Sometimes a breeze will pick up and the petals will float like Crystalflies from one end of the street to the other. And when the sun begins to set, I'll find a nice spot to watch the city lights come on. From high up above, they look like flickering specks of sunlight dancing beneath the forest shade at noon. I could stay up there all day if I wasn't in a hurry to deliver my packages... *sigh* I wish I could take Granny with me and show her all these things.",
            "More About Kirara: V\tIt's really important to enjoy your life! In the last few days of a long-distance trip, or on a night when all my work’s done, I'll always have a hearty meal at the busiest restaurant, then look for the most comfortable rooftop and feel the breeze on my face until I fall sound asleep... There are so many little joys in the world that deserve to be savored, and it'd be such a great loss if I didn't relish every one of them. Which is why I always pick the bones clean when I'm eating fish!",
            "Kirara's Hobbies\tI like delivering packages across the world. Whenever I see an address I've never been to before, I get so excited that I can't sleep. I mean, I just wish that I could be there right this instant. I grew up surrounded by forests and shrubs, and it gets boring pretty quickly. But things are different out here. There are so many things I've never seen before, and it feels like there's something new waiting for me around every corner!",
            "Kirara's Troubles\tThe life of a human may be full of surprises, but there are so many rules too. Humans can't sleep on a roof, catch fish from a pond, or find a nice place to scratch and sharpen their claws... But as soon as I revert to my original form, no one bats an eye over any of these things. The trouble is that my nekomata form attracts a lot of attention, so I can't just walk into a restaurant and order food the way a human would...",
            "Favorite Food\tWhen I was still a cat, I loved everything Granny made for me — I could gobble up an entire bowl in one go! As for now... Sashimi Platters are my go-to staple! With tender and fresh fish directly served on a plate, I don't even have to go through the hassle of removing the bones and scales! But the restaurant staff always gives me this strange look whenever I start working my way through the fish heads...",
            "Least Favorite Food\tOnce, I was catching fish by the ocean when a crab caught me off guard and pinched my tails from behind. It hurt so bad, I thought they were gonna get snipped off! Ugh, why do people like eating crab anyway? They have so little meat, and their shells are so unbelievably thick — I can't even open them with my claws. Oh, and I can't stand anything hot either. I could hardly believe it when I learned there's a dish called \"Butter Crab.\" How do humans manage to eat something so hard AND hot?",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tWhoa, this is amazing! I've never tasted anything like this before! You... you wouldn't happen to be the great youkai of cooking or something, would you?",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tMm-hm, delicious! Is there more? I wanna take some with me on the road!",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tUm, this... reminds me of life in the wilderness...",
            "Birthday\tHappy birthday! It doesn't matter if you're a human or a youkai, coming into this world is always worth celebrating! If you want, I can take you to the place I grew up in. It's not bustling with people, and it's not all that interesting, but it always makes me feel relaxed. Oh, and I'll let you sleep inside my favorite box, too! Having a nap inside it always feels great!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tOoh! I can feel my youkai powers growing!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tHuh? Are my tails getting longer too?",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tMy body feels lighter! I feel like I could deliver ten different packages in one go!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tWhoa... With this much power, I think even that kitsune youkai might need to watch out... Hehe, just kidding! It's not a competition, after all. I'm just happy as long as I get to keep every customer's package safe. And you too, for always staying by my side. Oh, by the way, wanna try touching my tails? I'm pretty sure they've gotten longer!",
            "Elemental Skill: I\tPhew!",
            "Elemental Skill: II\tScratch that!",
            "Elemental Skill: III\tComing through~",
            "Elemental Burst: I\tExpress delivery~!",

            "Character Details\tIf you ask anyone in Inazuma which delivery company is the most reliable, the name \"Komaniya Express\" will surely be mentioned.\nIf you were to continue the line of inquiry and ask just what about their service left the deepest impression, you would see a smile creep onto their lips as they tell you of a certain special courier...\nThat adorable, vivacious young youkai with two twin twirling tails. After you thank her for delivering your package, she will bow deeply while wearing an expression of unadulterated bliss, as though she was the one receiving the gift.\nIf you're willing to spend the time to leave a 5-star rating on the feedback board or give her a few snacks, you may even see stars of joy shoot from this youkai's eyes as her tails swish back and forth.\nAh! But the same people who tell you this will also warn you that this nekomata isn't some weak little thing you can pick on. If you have designs on packages that don't belong to you or get carried away and try to touch her tails... Well, then you'll have to face the consequences.\nAfter hearing all this, it's hard to resist going to Komaniya Express...\n\"Excuse me, I have a package to deliver, and I was hoping the neko—\"\nWithout waiting for you to finish, the owner turns around and shouts \"Kirara! Another one for you!\" as though it were an everyday occurrence.\nAt that moment, a beaming girl will bound towards you, quickly fix her hair and adjust her clothes, and say with a smile—\n\"Welcome, and thank you for choosing Komaniya Express!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tKirara's earliest memories are of wandering the wilds of Inazuma.\nBack then, she was a nameless kitten with but one tail, and woke every morning with an empty, growling stomach. After a stretch, a yawn, and a single \"meow\" as though to bellyache about her circumstances, she would begin to hunt for breakfast. The menu often included finches that had let down their guard, or overly curious young fish too near the shore.\nWhenever she encountered adventurers out in the wilderness, she would lie down at a safe distance and watch intently as they fished out all kinds of marvelous instruments from their packs. Fwoosh! Suddenly there was a fire roaring. Bong! A strange cauldron was set over the fire. And then, with a bubbling sound, an intoxicating scent would occasionally waft over on the breeze...\nObserving this process with wide eyes, to her it was as if she had witnessed magic. Thus a yearning for human society began to flutter about in her chest, as though a butterfly had flown into her heart.\nDuring a frigid winter night with the biting winds howling, Kirara, still a small kitten, was frozen to the point of being unable to feel her tail.\n\"Gotta find a warm place to hide. Even a hollow in a tree will do...\" She thought to herself. But when she was able to look up, she saw a cluster of warm lights flickering not too far away...\nThis was the first time Kirara entered a human home, and while she was curious about everything around her, she was also frightened. The owner of the house seemed not to notice the kitten that had found its way into her home, but Kirara paid little notice. She found a small square box near the entryway into which she snugly fit, and into it did she sit, falling asleep almost immediately.\n\"I'll just rest the night, just one night...\" were her last thoughts before dreams took her...\nYet when she awoke, she found a warm fire crackled away next to her, and beside it was a fragrant bowl of nekomanma. Directly across from her was an old lady in the middle of knitting a woolen sweater. The old lady seemed to be trying to say something, as though encouraging her to eat. With her tail down and guard raised, she cautiously took a bite of that aromatic nekomanma in front of her that she was so curious about...\nIt was the most delicious thing she had ever eaten, to the point she began to doubt whether or not she was still dreaming!\nAnd so, she stayed in that cozy little home for one winter after another, and heard story after story from that kind old woman...\nOn occasion, when Kirara thinks back to that first night, she'll cock her head and ask herself:\n\"Strange... what was I thinking about before I fell asleep again...?\"",
            "Character Story 2\tKirara enjoys human cities, with their fireworks, marketplaces and scattered eaves. There is always something she's never seen before, waiting to be discovered.\nWhen she first became a nekomata, she used her youkai powers to enter Inazuma City in a human form. She eagerly explored every nook and cranny in the city, and not even the roof of the Almighty Shogun's Tenshukaku was immune from her curiosity. This is the reason that the Tenryou Commission is one of the addresses she is most familiar with.\nThough the Tenryou Commission taught her rules like \"don't climb on other people's roofs\" and \"don't eat the ornamental koi\", then she learned \"how to be a good youkai in human society\" from none other than the Lady Kitsune of the Grand Narukami Shrine. Kirara has caught the eye of \"the greatest and coolest youkai,\" as she calls her, and Yae Miko, for her part, has been willing to impart all her experience upon her lively and interesting junior. Upon learning that Kirara felt the streets and alleys of Inazuma City were priceless treasures, Miko recommended that she seek employment at Komaniya Express.\n\"If you want to blend into human society, then you must work like an ordinary human. This is most important.\" Thus spoke the Lady Kitsune.\n\"Ah, yes,\" the illustrious priestess appended, \"Packages addressed to Guuji Yae at the Grand Narukami Shrine must be given the utmost priority. This is even more paramount than what I just said before!\"",
            "Character Story 3\tSometimes, bandits with less than honorable intentions will covet those bulging parcels. Hiding beside the paths that the deliveries must take, they carefully eye the passing couriers.\nIf the delivery person looks tough, or is in a group, the bandits won't risk it. After all, it's just another day with an empty stomach at most.\nBut when they chance upon a courier like Kirara, appearing delicate and traveling alone, their hearts leap with joy and anticipation. They can nearly taste the Mora that has fallen neatly into their laps.\nWhen Kirara passes, the bandits emerge from concealment and surround her, maliciously blocking her way forward.\n\"Huh? Do you need something?\" Kirara stops uncertainly.\nUpon closer inspection, this young lady has two tails. Strange, to be sure, but she looks frail and her face is kind — the perfect prey, through and through. Even better, the pack she carries is bursting with thick packages. Truly, this is a good day for a robbery!\n\"Uhm... If you have packages you'd like to deliver, please visit our Inazuma City offi—\"\nMost bandits don't even let her finish before brandishing their blades. The more polite sort will attempt to persuade her to put down her delivery pack willingly for her own safety. The desperate will simply swarm her, hands outstretched to plunder.\nBut whatever their methods, the result is always the same—\nThe next morning, several large boxes will have appeared on the doorstep of the Tenryou Commission. Under the \"Type of Goods Delivered\" section of the delivery slip sealing the packages, a single word will be written: \"Meanies.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen she first moved to Inazuma City, Kirara would often lie by the roadside, observing the pedestrians passing by.\n\"Oh! So this is how human girls dress...\" Her wish to join human society made her very conscious of her own outfit, and whether or not it was similar to those around her.\nIn the springtime, girls would often pluck a flower to place behind their ear or in their hair... Soon after, a special accessory became quite popular... Then everyone began flocking to some particular style of bracelet...\nKirara accepted every style without question, imitating every trend as she saw it. She never thought there was anything wrong with what she was doing, just that all those accessories would occasionally restrict her movement and make it hard to climb up and down. It was so different from being a kitten out in the countryside!\nThis persisted one day, when she was delivering a package to an old customer named Chiori, and she received a serious dressing down...\nAt the time, Kirara had politely knocked on the door before gently pushing her way inside. But she couldn't have known that Chiori would glare at Kirara as though she were a cat that had fallen into a bucket of paints...\nThis Inazuman fashion designer who had opened a famous design label in Fontaine was already quite familiar with Kirara, and so she spoke directly—\n\"Utter insanity! What did you do on the way here? Fight Specters? What kind of garbage have you covered yourself in? How did that garish flower get stuck in your hair? It's assaulting my eyeballs. Really, the only thing on your entire body with a speck of taste is those shoes...\"\n\"Um, Chiori, y—you know th—those are just m—my feet...\" Kirara managed to stammer nervously.\nChiori buried her face in her hands, and immediately picked up her scissors and some cloth before pulling Kirara into a changing room.\n\"Now don't you misunderstand! It's just that I'd be embarrassed to let anyone see you walking out of my shop looking like THAT!\"\nThe dressing down became a dressing up, and after the sound of snapping scissors and swift needlework faded to silence, Kirara had the outfit she now wears today.\nFrom then on, she had a new task when delivering packages: answering client's questions about just where she got that delightful outfit. Thus did the reputation of Chiori's shop spread far and wide.\n\"Hmph. I told you my judgment was immaculate.\" On this delivery run to Fontaine, Kirara found her friend in seemingly much better spirits.\n\"Other than the clothing orders, is there anything else?\" Inquired Chiori.\n\"Yes, there is, it's just that...\"\n\"Come on, out with it, stop beating around the bush!\"\n\"The customers are asking... if you, that is, your shop... Can you release a shoe design that looks like a cat's paw pads?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tTo Kirara, every delivery is a priceless treasure. Each package takes her to different places, and allows her to see all kinds of scenery.\nAfter work, Kirara would go to the \"Undelivered Packages\" section of the warehouse, and see all the myriad reasons that packages couldn't be delivered to their recipients.\n\"Filled in wrong address,\" \"recipient moved,\" \"wrong name\"...\nEach stranded package was like a fish bone lodged in her throat, choking her slowly. Thus, she began to quietly record the details of each package, and used her routes during work and spare time to discover the whereabouts of each recipient.\nThis resulted in the reputation of Komaniya Express increasing by the day, as customers rushed to praise the reliability and quality of their service: No package was undeliverable.\nWhen the owner of Komaniya Express heard of this, they spent all night designing a new title to issue to Kirara: Gold Level Courier.\n\"Actually, when I saw that the 'Undelivered Packages' section was empty, I thought we'd been robbed...\" confided the owner.\nFor Kirara, her greatest happiness is the moment she delivers a package into the hands of the recipient. After a long day making deliveries, she likes to climb to a high place, taking in the sights of the city while listening to the sounds of mirth drifting upward from the markets.\nThis is when she recalls her days as a kitten, listening to stories on the lap of that old lady. The twists and turns and sudden reveals, the fantastic beasts and monsters, all gently follow Kirara's memories like the cool evening breeze, blowing gently into her heart.\nAnd just like the old days, she gently closes her eyes as the stories intermingle with her dreams, welcoming the arrival of tomorrow with contentment.",
            "Mystery Packages\tSome clients of Komaniya Express may be surprised to discover a mysterious package at their door. Most of these packages are small and exquisite, and beautifully decorated.\nCupping the parcel in their hands and shaking their heads, they might think it strange, as they haven't bought anything recently, nor is there any writing on the package. But they may have already forgotten that in the not-too-distant past, they gave some snacks to that courier with two tails.\nEach package usually contains a lovely little gift, such as a dried flower of the Nilotpala Lotus, a Starconch ornament, or if the household has young children, a Scarab with peculiar patterns on its shell!\nThese are all items that Kirara has collected while out on her deliveries. To her, each is a novel and fascinating treasure, and perfect as thank-you gifts. Unfortunately, the rules of Komaniya Express forbid any transactions between employees and clients. Thus, Kirara must make each small box herself, adding cute decorations, and quietly placing them on the recipients' doorsteps.\nHowever, the beneficiary of by far the most \"mystery packages\" is a small home in the Inazuman countryside...\nThough Kirara is quick to say she never wants to go back being some \"great youkai\" roaming the mountains and valleys, whenever she has time, she will always run back to that old house from that frigid winter's night. Leaving a present at the door, if she happens to find the old woman sunning herself in the yard, she'll immediately return to being a cat. \"Meow, meow,\" she'll call, jumping up onto the woman's knees, curling up into a ball and pouting for attention.\n\"Ah! Back, are we, Kirara?\" The old woman smiles and laughs. She doesn't know that this little cat is already a renowned courier. All she knows is that she often goes out to \"play\" for ever longer periods.\n\"You really are growing up so fast. I remember when I found you in the box, you were such a tiny little thing...\" Scratching Kirara's head, the old woman fishes out a round, shimmering pearl and places it on her paw pads.\n\"See? This is that Sango Pearl from the story. Now, I don't know who it's from, but there it was on the doorstep, along with some snacks, too.\" The old woman also quietly observes to herself: \"When I wake up, the house is so clean and orderly, and breakfast is already prepared. How very odd...\"\n\"Why, you haven't grown into a youkai who takes care of me in my old age, have you, little cat?\"\nWhenever Kirara hears this, she stretches innocently, letting out a contented yawn as she pretends to have no idea what the old woman is saying.\nAfter speaking, the old woman falls silent and just smiles warmly. The two of them then continue to enjoy a leisurely afternoon bathed in sunshine.",
            "Vision\tOne night in the depths of midwinter, Kirara was lying down by the coals, taking a nap. But try as she might, she simply couldn't sleep well.\nThe charcoal had long burned out, and even the smoldering embers had gasped their final breath as the chill wind rattled in through cracks in window frames and seeped under the doors. Kirara involuntarily curled up tightly, hugging her tail close. Lately, her tail was always itchy and restless, and no matter how much she licked it, it was never enough to calm it.\n\"Strange, Granny left this morning, she's been gone way too long...\" she quietly mewed to herself.\nThe final lingering ember became darkened ash, and even the residual warmth it had provided was snuffed out. Kirara stretched out and looked out uneasily at the snowflakes falling outside the house, and then quietly leaped out the window.\nThe snowflakes under her feet were chilly, and her paw pads soon ached from the cold. Climbing onto the roof, she gazed out towards the city. But the moon was totally obscured this night, and the surroundings were pitch black without even a speck of light.\n\"I remember there was a really, really tall tree nearby...\"\nKirara's tail seemed even more anxious than she was. As she climbed, it repeatedly refused to obey her mental commands and nearly caused her to fall.\nThe tree stretched ever upward, so tall it seemed without end. Kirara did not think about just how high she had climbed. Instead, stories of youkai and humans raced across her mind. It seemed as if she wasn't climbing a tree but pursuing days gone by, and if she was but a step too slow, all might slip away forever...\n\"Faster, just a bit faster...\"\nFinally, she reached the crown of the tree, and all the world lay spread beneath her. In the distance, a dazzling light suddenly lit the blackness before her eyes like a firefly — the light from the city at night.\nIn that moment, it was as if something dormant in Kirara's heart was ignited, and all the fantastical stories of the past had finally become reality, a thousand rays of shimmering light streaming into that galaxy of fireworks. The stories that had once seemed so far away were now so close she could almost reach out and touch them, and she now yearned as never before to bask in that glow.\n\"Ah! I see her!\"\nSomehow, an unseen power helped Kirara pick out the one person she desired to see amongst the dazzling stream of lights.\nWhen she safely alighted back on the ground, the clouds parted and the moonlight cast her shadow upon the snow, a shadow that now boasted two tails...\n\"Are you sure you don't want to stay the night? The snow has only just stopped, and getting back won't be easy,\" urged the landlord.\n\"No, no, I couldn't! I have a little cat at home, waiting for my return, haha...\" laughed the old woman as she stood before the entryway.\n\"If that's the case, I'll take you back!\" A young female voice suddenly rang out from outside.\nThe landlord and old woman peered outside, and there they saw a youthful lady with two restless tails, and a shining Vision dangling from her waist."

As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated.\nAs a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.\nAfter all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives.",

She has an innocent passion for explosives, and is incredibly enthusiastic in all that she does.\nUnder the protection of the Knights of Favonius, she is protected from harm and those of ill intent.\nThis young girl soon forged an unbreakable bond with everyone in the Knights of Favonius.\nBeing sent to the solitary confinement room by Jean, helping Amber improving Baron Bunny, as well as developing new bombs...\nThese parts of Klee's life are all invaluable treasures to her.",

They entrusted Klee to the care of Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.\nThough still small, Klee knew she would one day become just like her mother.\nOne day, her explosives would become something that her mother would be proud of.",

Loyalty to the Raiden Shogun, of course! That is also my life's creed.",
            "About Kujou Sara: Preparing for War\tAm I ready to depart? Let me put it to you like this. If you were to make a habit of asking me this question every time before you move out, you would find that you only receive an answer from me one time out of 10. The other nine times, I would already be fighting fiercely on the front line. Not because I am foolhardy, nor because I lack courtesy, but because the battle never waits till you are ready.",

I am led to believe that you can hear those ambitions...The ones echoing within the Visions embedded on the Statue of the Omnipresent God? I'd like you to tell me more about them.

            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tIn the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there.",
            "About Yoimiya\tAs long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know — all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle. It is transient, but Inazuma is eternal, and my mission is to protect Inazuma.",
            "About Shikanoin Heizou\tShikanoin and I may be colleagues, but I have few positive words to say about him. He seems preoccupied with his personal schemes while official duties take second place. The only reason I have not sought to bring him into line so far is that his investigations deliver results... \n*sigh* He is such a headache.",
            "About the Raiden Shogun: Trust\tAs I'm sure you've heard many times before, the Almighty Shogun seeks Eternity — an existence beyond the dominion of thought and longing. \"Abandon mortal ties, strive for an unchanging Eternity\"... The Almighty Shogun's manner is always resolute, and I do not always fully grasp the meaning of her words. But this is her decision, and I trust her.",
            "About the Raiden Shogun: Service\tSo, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake. She has simply chosen to pursue eternity by a different route. I do not know whether the Shogun has finally found inner peace after protecting Inazuma over all these millennia. All I know is that however perilous the road ahead may become, I will follow her as I have always done.",
            "About Yae Miko\tGuuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her. But... if there ever comes a day when she disobeys the Shogun's will, then please accept my apologies in advance.",
            "About Sangonomiya Kokomi\tShe is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of. I wonder if I should adopt this technique for commanding the Shogun's Army? Hmm... but this could lead us to a situation whereby war is waged at the negotiation table, each side with their pack of strategy cards, playing them one by one until a victor emerges... Then again, perhaps not.",
            "About Gorou\tGorou is to Sangonomiya Kokomi as I am to the Raiden Shogun. He is fiercely loyal, and I have great respect for this. It's a shame we're on opposing sides, so we'll never get to work together... Still, I am glad to have an admirable foe. Also... I hear he's a fifth-born son. That just makes it even better.",
            "About Arataki Itto\tTsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest oni I've ever encountered. He showed he was enough of a man to admit defeat, but the rematch he insisted upon... Tsk... To this day, I still don't want to talk about it. If you really must know, you can go and ask him yourself.",
            "About Kuki Shinobu\tWith her talent and qualifications, it's a shame she decided to join the Arataki gang. I must concede, however, that at the very least, her presence has effectively prevented idlers from stirring up trouble and disturbing the public, reducing the burden on the Tenryou Commission.",
            "About Kirara\tRecently, I often feel a mysterious gaze from the shadows that disappears as soon as I turn to look. What an absurd prank... Huh? A nekomata, you say? Huh... She should've just come right up to me if she needed something.",
            "More About Kujou Sara: I\tYou want to know more about me? ...Know what, exactly? I can't discuss Tenryou Commission business with you, that's strictly confidential, and I certainly can't divulge anything relating to the Almighty Shogun. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Hmm? Me on a personal level...? I suppose that's not out of the question, just... unprecedented.",
            "More About Kujou Sara: II\tI lead a relatively simple life when I'm not leading an army into battle. I always get out of bed at 5:05 on the dot. Then I go to the courtyard where I take five deep breaths before walking five laps around it. For breakfast, I typically eat five mouthfuls... Five is my lucky number, so I do things in fives. Do you have some objection to that?",
            "More About Kujou Sara: III\tThe thing that gave me the most trouble when enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree was those officers of the Shogun's Army who would abuse their authority to be heavy-handed with those we detained. The will of the Almighty Shogun must be executed, but I do not condone violence against innocent people! I have expressly forbidden such behavior on countless occasions but judging by the outcome, it seems difficult to root out. If you have any ideas on how to tackle it, please share them with me.",
            "More About Kujou Sara: IV\tAlthough I was fully adopted by the Kujou Clan, I know that Takayuki does not look at me the same way he looks at Kamaji. I might be a little stone-faced sometimes, but even I get lonely... especially when I catch sight of one of my subordinates sharing an intimate moment with their family. ...\nI'm sorry, I have nothing but gratitude for Takayuki. How could I be so disrespectful...",
            "More About Kujou Sara: V\tNow that I think about it, you and I are a good example of achieving concord through conflict. We were on opposite sides — diametrically opposed, you could say. I never imagined I would end up alongside you, either in battle or in long conversation... Fate has been kind to me, no, sorry, ignore that.",
            "Kujou Sara's Hobbies\tTo this day, not a day goes by without bow exercises and target practice. From adopting the stance, to aiming, to hearing the twang of the bowstring, none of this is dry and repetitive for me — it is about transcending the me of yesterday! I wouldn't call it a hobby so much as a lifelong discipline.",
            "Kujou Sara's Troubles\tThe existence of a tengu warrior's wings is an objective fact, as is the reality that they will take up a certain amount of space when standing side-by-side. So when you say \"come closer,\" I fail to see how exactly I am supposed to achieve that.",
            "Favorite Food\tI have always had a preference for easy-to-carry foods that provide quick and ample sustenance, such as Onigiri. The top choice for replenishing your stamina in the middle of a battle! But that's just a personal preference. I don't dictate what my subordinates have to eat.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI generally avoid sweet foods, not that I have a strong aversion to them. Why? Well, sweet things put your mind and body at rest, so if I ever eat sweet things it's easy to... Ahem, essentially, I mustn't slack off and that's the end of it. No further questions on this topic!",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tSo, there is a dish that tastes even better than Onigiri? Then I shall be sure to remember its name.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tI have eaten my fill. Thank you for your hospitality.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tNo need for dessert...",
            "Birthday\tExcellent timing. I will dispense with the formalities and get straight to the point — do you have a birthday wish? Providing that it does not conflict with the Almighty Shogun's grand cause, I will make every effort to see it come to fruition. To show that I am being completely serious, I will allow you to make not one, but five birthday wishes.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tMy bow sounds in peak condition. One shot is all I need.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tPower duly assimilated. Ready to receive instruction.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tThe Shogun's Army might as well just be me!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tThe responsibility for honing my strength and advancing my martial abilities lies with me, and yet you have so diligently and willingly helped me... I will become worthy of this power by harnessing it for a higher cause! Also... the favor of the tengu will always be with you!",

            "Character Details\tThe blood of the tengu runs through Kujou Sara's veins, but she does not dwell in the forests and mountains as they do. She was fostered from a young age by the Kujou Clan and has served since then as part of the Tenryou Commission.\nThe Tenryou Commission is one arm of the Tri-Commission, and is in charge of the security of Inazuma. Today, Sara is a general of the Tenryou Commission, and hers is the vital task of maintaining order within Inazuma City itself.\nShe governs well and is ever determined to set a good example for her subordinates. No matter how tough the issue, if it falls under the Tenryou Commission's jurisdiction, Sara can solve it in good time.\nSara smiles little and is swift and resolute in the pursuit of her missions, and so many Inazumans consider her an inaccessible, stone-cold military person.\nHowever, such an assessment might be too surface-level for someone like Sara, who seems cool on the outside but burns within.",
            "Character Story 1\tIn Inazuma, the Vision Hunt Decree is the manifestation of the Raiden Shogun's will to pursue Eternity, and Sara is the main enforcer of that decree.\nSara believes that Visions, in the hands of those with incorrectly-aligned minds, will destabilize the foundations of Inazuma, thus necessitating the Vision Hunt Decree.\nHowever, this does not mean that Sara will stoop to any means necessary to enforce it.\nWhen citizens are inevitably affected as the decree is carried out, she will expend the utmost patience and sincerity to attempt to explain the Almighty Shogun's long-term goals.\nShe has also given clear orders forbidding the harming or exploiting of civilians during the pursuit of the decree, as such evil deeds will only drag the great name of the Archon through the mud.\nUnfortunately, the vast ideals of the Archon are too great for mortals to perceive, and resentment arises nonetheless, with some even uniting to resist those who enforce the decree.\nIn such circumstances, where she has no choice but to take action, Sara often sighs helplessly before facing the enemy.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe Shogun's Army has Kujou Sara's leadership to thank in large part for the fearlessness and unity of its soldiery.\nSurveying battle lines, setting up training plans, selecting weapons and armor... Unlike many generals who prefer to strategize and plan from the rear, Sara prefers to do such things herself.\nSara is very harsh on herself during training, with her personal regimen being over ten times tougher than that which the ordinary troops go through. Even when night has fallen and the world has gone to sleep, one can still hear the sounds of her bow being drawn echoing through the dojo.\nOn the battlefield, she has always been at the tip of the spear, leading the troops with absolute heroism and awe-inspiring fighting spirit.\nWhen the dust has settled, she will also personally see to the wounded, and give reward and mete out punishment based on merit. Every step of the battle that passes through her hands is managed well, with missteps being very few and far between.\nSara's troops are all witnesses to her words and deeds. No one who has fought alongside her does not hold her in the highest regard.\nThe general is the soul of the army, and fine generals are hard to find. Small wonder, then, that Sara has always been the pride of the Shogun's Army.",
            "Character Story 3\tEven when she is not training, Sara brings her austere, strict nature into her daily life.\nHer life seems to follow some sort of eternal, unchanging rule. She wakes up on the dot, trains on the dot, eats a fixed amount...\nFrom things as large as training regimens to things as small as food consumption, Sara has her own perspective and pursues her self-created standards to the last letter.\n\"Miscellaneous objects are to be sorted by category, and furnishings are to be arrayed in straight lines. There is to neither be dirt in any corner, nor on the ground.\"\nThese are the standards Sara holds her dwelling up to.\nShe views excellence in such matters to also be a part of her training, and handles them herself, not requiring the aid of any servants.\nThat said, how could her servants ever just stand idly by? Every time they meet Sara, they will implore her to put the cleaning cloth down and leave the matter to them.\nHaving repeatedly declined their offers to no avail, Sara eventually took to cleaning up behind closed doors, posting up this sign outside her room—\n\"Training in Progress, Do Not Disturb.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tAlthough she has grown up amongst humans, Sara still maintains the various habits of the tengu. When she leaves the Tenryou Commission Headquarters on occasion, it is mostly to go to the mountains.\nShe knows them like the back of her hand, and has witnessed many strange creatures not often told of in human tales.\nAmong them are many fierce and evil things, but there are also little creatures that mean no harm. To Sara, however, these are just differences in form.\nThere was a time when a sizable spate of thefts was reported to the police station in quick succession, and they could not find the culprit. Walking through the woods on higher alert than usual, Sara quickly espied the bake-danuki running along hurriedly while carrying their plunder.\nOf course, bake-danuki are not evil by nature, but only steal food out of gluttony.\nCapturing the creatures, Sara had only this to say as she reclaimed their ill-gotten gains:\n\"Hiding in the mountains will not let you escape judgment. Listen closely, for this is your final warning. Do not make yourself a nuisance to civilians again, or else...\"\nThe bake-danuki were chilled to the bone, nodding as they balled up in a corner. After this, they would keep to that agreement and did not again do such ill.\nAs for the sharp-tongued Sara, she would bring various melons and fruits that could keep for a longer period up to the mountains while training there, making sure to deposit them in the bake-danuki's dwelling whenever she passed through.\nShe did not explain herself, and in any case, did not consider this any sort of gift. If she had to describe it... then perhaps a sort of consolation to those who had turned from an unrighteous path might be the best description for such things.",
            "Character Story 5\tSara has been training with the Shogun's Army ever since she was taken in by the Tenryou Commission. The soldiers actually thought that she was a boy at first due to her coming to train at an early age, and they took care of her very well.\nHaving been a little frightened of crowds at first, Sara became much more outgoing due to this warm reception, and would even play games with the other troops.\nHowever, the soldiers she played alongside were severely punished by the Clan Head, while she was merely given a cold chastening.\n\"Not following military law and neglecting your training... I did not take you in just to have you do such pointless things.\"\nSince then, Sara would be conscientious in maintaining a certain distance from others. Rather than blending in with the crowd, she sought first to attain surpassing martial prowess, bearing in mind at all times that she would someday take command.\n\"The Raiden Shogun's helper. An example to the Tenryou Commission. The pride of the Clan Head.\"\nNone of these three identities put her first in any way. But to Sara, this was her. She was a warrior whose being was calm and austerity.\nNo one ever told her that she should give herself more consideration, and Sara did not necessarily lack such concerns either.\nHer chains as an adopted child and the solitude of a non-human had always accompanied her mission and status.\nBut to stop due to such obstacles is the dilemma of the weak, and being Kujou Sara, her path would not end here. She would be the Electro Archon's staunchest adherent and the most clear-headed of her generals.",
            "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder\tOut of their worship and love for the Raiden Shogun, many merchants have created and sold artwork related to her.\nThe most popular product among them is the \"Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder,\" a lacquerware doll made using the deity's image as its template.\nSara rose early the day it went on the market, easily becoming first in the queue to purchase the statue. This became something of a hot topic for a while.\nSara would make no retort concerning any such stories. From her perspective, she bought that item with pious respect in her heart.\nIn all matters related to the Shogun, she had never once committed a perfunctory or negligent act. Indeed, she went forth personally to select and purchase a statue and even personally prepared a shrine within which it might be kept upon her return.\nShe placed five such statues in specially-placed display cases, and would clean them whenever she returned home. If she could not be there, she would arrange for artisans to perform that maintenance instead...\nTo someone like Sara who lacks friends and who is too busy to have much of a private life, the Raiden Shogun is not merely a deity, but also a form of repose.\nThe Shogun is her will, her future, her strength... even the harbinger of her fate — the confluence of all that is noble. Sara's adherence is one born out of recognition and trust.\nThe intricately-made Archon statue makes Sara feel like the Almighty Shogun is not far off in her Tenshukaku, but is a wisdom, an ideal, a strength of heart that supports her every step of the way.\nThese moments of tranquility bring her indescribable enjoyment.",
            "Vision\tWhen she obtained her Vision, she had not yet been given a name or surname.\nShe originally lived in a quiet mountain forest that had, from a time unknown, become plagued by great evils that robbed it of its former peace.\nThough she had the strength of the tengu, she was still young and could not stand against the monsters alone, and was hurled from a cliff during the battle, her wings having been damaged prior.\nPlummeting from the heights, and unable to unfurl her injured wings, she seemed fated to fall to her death.\n\"No! It can't end like this! I... I always believed that I could protect this place forever with my strength...\"\nWhen day dawned the next day, some passers-by discovered an unconscious girl by the roadside. She looked a little worse for the wear but seemed otherwise unharmed, adding to the mystery of how she had ended up here.\nAstonished, the people brought her back to the city and reported the matter to the Tenryou Commission immediately.\nThat was when the Kujou Clan Head, Kujou Takayuki, noticed that the glowing item in her hand was a Vision — a thing that many desired but few ever gained.\nRealizing that she this child had gained the attention of an Archon even at her young age, Takayuki believed that she was a destined child, sent to the Tenryou Commission by the heavens.\nTaking her in, he named her \"Sara,\" and would train her to become an all-around warrior, asking that she serve the Shogun and fight for Inazuma.\nKujou Takayuki believed that in raising such an excellent general, the status and future of the Kujou Clan would become more secure. And indeed, all that he had hoped would steadily come to pass.\nSara, armed with her Vision, would swiftly distinguish herself, rising through the ranks to become a general of the Tenryou Commission at a young age, just as many had hoped.\nYet it was precisely because she possessed a Vision that Sara knew this better than anyone: her surviving that fall unscathed was due to the Archon looking upon her with favor in that instant.\nIn but a single glance, she had been given the power that sustained her life. Everything she had, therefore, could be described as existing by the Almighty Shogun's grace.\nFighting for the Shogun...\nSara believed that this was neither her duty nor a result of her foster father's schemes, but was instead her truest calling."

I have yet to see him on patrol or apprehend anyone, and he occasionally comes to me to buy intelligence. In exchange, I asked him to put in a good word for me whenever I'm bailing people out of the Police Station. He gladly agreed. I'd say that's a pretty good deal...

Sometimes I still slip into interview mode.",
            "More About Kuki Shinobu: II\tI come from a family of shrine maidens but I'm not cut out for that kind of work at all. When I ran away from home, I immediately thought I should learn as much as possible to support myself. I studied everything from cooking, tailoring, and fighting, to legal consulting, publishing, and editing...

I don't mind putting on a face to get us out of a sticky predicament, but I still prefer not to smile.",
            "More About Kuki Shinobu: IV\tWhen I first joined the Arataki Gang, the boss told me to teach the others how to fight. So the first thing I did was beat them up, one by one. I was a little surprised that even in their bruised and swollen state they still respectfully called me Shinobu and asked me to lead them. Hmph, at that moment, I knew they really were a big bunch of idiots... But that's fine, even a group like this won't slow me down, I'll just take care of everything myself.",
            "More About Kuki Shinobu: V\tIt's my own decision to stay in the Arataki Gang. It can be pretty annoying having to clean up their mess all the time, but in return, they treat me with a sincerity that is irreplaceable... They always save the best things for me and never leave me feeling down. When I announced my decision to stay in the gang, they all cheered for me. I know outsiders don't think very highly of the Arataki Gang, and the members themselves don't really care what others think. But, I still want to strive to change the impression we leave. I might complain about them from time to time as my family, but I'll never let anyone badmouth them.",
            "Kuki Shinobu's Hobbies\tBeing in the gang means having lots of free time. I often finish reading a whole book or even pass a certificate exam before I even realize it. Kinda nice, wouldn't you agree? When my family asks about me, at least I can tell them I don't waste my time, and when I go job hunting, I have lots of qualifications to rely on. In this ultra-competitive society, a misfit like myself with all these certificates will never go hungry.",
            "Kuki Shinobu's Troubles\tBack then, I wanted to avoid getting dragged back to the shrine at all cost, so I had to find a way to stand on my own two feet. So far, I think I'm doing alright.",

            "Character Details\tIn the Arataki Gang, where swaggering commotion is something of an aesthetic, the ever-masked and low-key Kuki Shinobu, the gang's second-in-command, stands out all the more against the backdrop of the other, more clamorous members.\nNo matter what sort of mess the others have gotten themselves into, this deputy is often able to solve their problems in a manner that is both professional and highly efficient.\nMaking some snacks for children who had theirs snatched away, giving scratched lacquerware a new coat of paint, and serving as an advocate for detained comrades...\nSuch are her skills that onlookers often wonder if there is anything that she cannot do.\n\"I wouldn't say that I'm certified for everything. There are some industries that just don't have standardized assessments, so there's no way to sit for any such tests.\"\nHer displeasure finds eloquent expression even behind her mask.\n\"Also, how can there be lines of work where you can find employment without the right qualifications? It boggles the mind.\"\nEqually mind-boggling, perhaps, is the fact that her deep puzzlement is just as contagious.",
            "Character Story 1\tPeople often say that a namecard is one's door into society.\nOf course, the act of embroidering such cards in gold and silver confounds comprehension, but it is true that giving another party a small card that contains your name, position, and contact details is a very efficient thing to do.\nWhen Kuki Shinobu first entered society, the details of her namecard were a matter of serious concern.\nEx-Grand Narukami Shrine Maiden? She strangled that thought in its mental crib the moment it was born.\nJust \"Kuki Shinobu\"? No, no, that would make her seem like some unemployed bum with neither skill in word or deed.\nPerhaps she should go get a certification, then. That was common wisdom, after all.\nCertifications serve as excellent proof of one's efforts, and are convincing ways of scoring points upon introduction — very useful things indeed.\nAfter easily getting a couple of such certificates, Shinobu finally reckoned that she could add a little color to her presently-blank namecard.\nUnfortunately, this process proved to feature pitfalls of its own: out of curiosity and in an effort to test herself, she had gotten a whole load of certifications in one go, causing the prefix section of her namecard to balloon uncontrollably.\n\"Junior Chef, Tailor, Actuary, Health Manager, Human Resource Manager...\"\nHaving lots of skills is not a bad thing, but there is such a thing of having too many skills, lest one struggle in the snare of figuring out one's titles, like Shinobu did.\nTo this day, Shinobu cannot remember how many namecards she has made.\nBut ever since she joined the Arataki Gang, her very first title has always been \"Deputy.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tAfter tasting Kuki Shinobu's very own Roasted Lavender Melon, the Arataki Gang all wept and exclaimed that they never knew that Lavender Melons could be so delicious when roasted.\nAnd the flavor, too, was most different from that which had been produced by any other method they had ever tried. Could it be that high-class culinary exams also taught people how to cook Lavender Melons a certain way?\nFaced with such a question, Shinobu put the melon she was grilling down before slowly telling a story.\nAt that time, she had gone to far-off Liyue to study law, and would visit this place known as Wanmin Restaurant in her free time.\nThe food there was incredibly diverse and made in unique ways, with ingenious ideas that surprised her, despite the fact that she had already obtained a high-level culinary license at the time.\nFrom slivers of stir-fried meat immersed in sauce to boiled cabbage with the fragrance of chicken soup... Indeed, the world was wide and full of wonders.\nAnd though one might be acquainted with every profession and be certified highly in every one, it is never wise to rest on one's laurels. Indeed, it is only by daring to try and make breakthroughs that one can surpass the limits set down by those who came before.\nThe Arataki Gang did not understand this in full, but they cheered all the same, for there was no harm in that — and their cheers certainly did the melons' flavor little harm.\nSeeing how they greatly enjoyed their meals, Shinobu kept the ending of the story to herself.\nBack then, the sous chef of Wanmin Restaurant had heard her say these words, and had urged Chef Mao to bring out the Salt and Pepper Slime...\nSuch food, she knew, would never appear in any culinary exam anywhere in the world.\nNor would the Arataki Gang want to learn that Shinobu had slathered slime ooze onto Lavender Melons as sauce before grilling them...",
            "Character Story 3\tThe Kuki Clan is a family of shrine maidens, a tradition that spans generations. Members of that family regard service to Narukami as a great honor.\nThis too was the case with her generation. After her sister Miyuki was sent to the Grand Shrine, she was also sent there from a young age as an understudy.\nOf course, a great store of rules and regulations came with this time-honored tradition: for example, how many days to fast to show one's sincerity and resolve, or how many ablutions were to be performed to avoid profaning the divine...\nNo one ever explained where these rules had come from or how they had been decided. She was simply told that they had existed since way back, and thus were to be followed.\nWhen Shinobu first arrived at the shrine, she would sometimes catch a chill from staying on the mountain at night. At this time, her family lived far from the shrine and her sister was out on an errand far afield.\nA strong-willed child, she did not ask the other shrine maidens for help, but would instead pluck thorned plants one by one, alone, before twining them around her body.\nAccording to a traditional saying, this deed would earn you the protection of Narukami and remove the illness from you. So she went on twining that loop of thorns, even as she whispered prayers to Narukami for protection deep into the night, shivering all the while.\nHowever, when the night was over, her chill was not cured. All she had earned instead was a tingling red mark around herself.\nAs the days passed, Shinobu would find again and again that the rules were not as foolproof as the ancients might have made them out to be, nor was the role of a shrine maiden quite as indispensable as they had claimed back home.\nWell then, didn't that mean that the very necessity of the Kuki Clan to become shrine maidens was also up for renegotiation?\nSome years later, Shinobu had already left the shrine for some time now, and with time to kill, she would flip through a book on herbology.\nWithin its pages, she found that it clearly, indeed vividly, described how the mountainous thorns had paralytic properties that could render birds and beasts unable to move, and that it was this property that led the ancients to include them into medicine to ameliorate topical aches and pains.\nShe was, well... speechless.\nShinobu thought to herself that yes, perhaps rules did have rhyme or reason behind them, but to treat the rules as reason in themselves must be treated as an obsolete practice.\nOn further reflection, she could not help but feel that she was happier living her current life.",
            "Character Story 4\tTo find work through which she might truly have freedom, Kuki Shinobu once declined all manner of respectable job offers, only agreeing to being hired as part-time outsourced staff.\nOne of these commissions came from an old lacquerware professional who had accidentally thrown his hip out of whack. The job itself was no challenge to Shinobu, bearer of an advanced certification in this field, but the address of the client was... well, a little special.\nWhen she brought the newly-maintained figurine to the Police Station, she ran into a petty thief who was making their escape from that site who, fleeing at all speed as they were, rammed right into her, sending the doll sailing into the air.\nSeeing that several days' work was about to go down the gutter, Shinobu struck out like lightning, seizing the figurine with one hand before whirling about and tripping the suspect.\nAll at once the surrounding people surged forward, subduing the crook. Afterward, Kujou Sara — seemingly the person who had placed this order — would come and thank her personally.\nAs for the goods, they were perfectly unharmed, much to Sara's surprise — to think that someone in the lacquerware business could have such martial skill!\nAfter learning of Shinobu's circumstances and her desire to \"find a job that gives her real freedom,\" Sara would consider for a moment before inviting Shinobu to join the Tenryou Commission.\n\"Hmm... No, I think I'll pass. The civil service seems a bit too limiting for me...\" At this point, Shinobu hesitated. \"But if those legal lectures and martial arts training could be done part-time, I will definitely consider the offer.\"\nFrom that day on, Shinobu would begin a new slew of part-time work.\nOne thing did surprise her, though — the general of the Tenryou Commission would always attend her lectures and demonstrations.\n\"It is only right that those who enforce the law should better understand it,\" so Sara said with perfect earnestness.\n\"The opportunity to test myself against similarly-skilled warriors is also not one I get often,\" Shinobu replied.\nSara's straightforward personality and decisive behavior were things Shinobu greatly approved of, and it was through this — and through Sara hiring her often to maintain figurines — that the two would quickly become friends.\nSara would also repeat her offer of employment several times, only for Shinobu to decline each time. Yet, this \"job that brings true freedom\" was not something she would find, either.\nThat is, until one day, when Sara wound up arriving late to the izakaya where they had arranged, as they often did, to meet and have figurines change hands, leaving Shinobu to drink till midnight.\n\"That's unexpected. I didn't think you could be late at all, Sara.\"\n\"Sorry. I was held up by a really rowdy gang...\"\n\"A gang? And what gang could have troubled you that much?\"\n\"Well, I wouldn't call them 'trouble' exactly. They call themselves the Arataki Gang...\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe news that the Arataki Gang now had a second-in-command raised a decent (though ultimately small) stir in Hanamizaka.\nIt was rumored that this deputy was well-versed in etiquette, law, and was quite the dab hand physically as well, bringing the other members to heel within a few days of arriving.\nThose who had witnessed this deputy's actions first hand were full of praise for them, saying that at long last, the Arataki Gang had someone polite and reasonable added to their ranks.\nSome did worry about this development, however: the Arataki Gang was, after all, not a proper organization by any measure.\nThe little hullabaloos they had caused in the past were nothing, really, but with the arrival of someone who could be the \"brains\" of the organization, who might put some discipline into them... Could this not also be the harbinger of worse incidents to come?\nNot to mention the Gang's daily operations... Other than logistics and transportation, home repair, and performance, they now added tax agency, legal consultation, event management and various other operations that both involved sizable capital investments and a not-insignificant air of danger to them.\nSurely they weren't intending to do all these things without the right licenses... right?\nAnd never mind the licenses, first — if they were to commit fraud in any of these newly-added businesses, they would surely be arrested by the Tenryou Commission!\nHowever, these wild guesses and ill-omened rumors would quickly be dispelled. The Arataki Gang's actions afterward were more than enough to show that they were still a gang of their word.\nThose who have attempted to enlist their new financial services have indeed seen their situations turned right around, and the transparency and uprightness of their processes have been stunning.\nOf course, it is also a pity that the Gang remains the Gang. The children of Hanamizaka still live in fear of Arataki Itto coming to win their snacks off them come dinner time, and often still return to their homes fuming.\nIn any case, it seems that even this legendary second-in-command will take a long time to reform the Arataki Gang's more... unbound ways.",
            "Oni Mask\tKuki Shinobu had yet to wear her mask when she first joined the Arataki Gang.\nWhile pursuing a certain business prospect, Shinobu was busy engaging in some serious talks. The other members of the gang were arrayed behind her in a single row, hands behind their backs and unsmiling.\n\"Just stay like that and don't say anything,\" Shinobu had instructed them to do so on short notice. \"This is the most effective way of negotiating... For you guys, anyway.\"\nThe talks were going exactly as Shinobu expected, until a passing child suddenly pointed at her, exclaiming:\n\"Mama, mama, look! That's the shrine maiden who never smiled back at the Grand Shrine! Wow, she looks so cool!\"\nThe child was whisked away by her panicked mother, but the quick departure did not change the mottled embarrassment and resignation on her face, as if she could not wait to flee for the hills and forests right that instant.\nAs for Itto's face, it was as if two onikabuto were wrestling for dominance upon it. Genta and the others, try as they might, ultimately lost their poker faces amidst gales of guffaws.\nThe next martial demonstration would, of course, see their faces beaten so hard that they were redder than Shinobu's was at that moment. If only they had known their fate, perhaps they might not have laughed quite so hard.\nFrom that day on, Shinobu would sport that mask. Pitch-black and claws bared, it lent her a positively demonic aspect.\nBy the way, it was also that martial demonstration that served as the origin of her moniker \"the demonic deputy\".",
            "Vision\tThe day she left the shrine, Kuki Shinobu left all the things that she possessed while serving as a shrine maiden behind at home, starting over from the most basic of belongings.\nAs such, she knew immediately that the bag she lifted was not the right weight. Hadn't she only left towels inside it?\nReaching into the bag and fishing about, she pulled out, of all things, a glittering Vision, its loveliness so striking such that her sister, Miyuki, could not help but gasp.\nAn irony it was indeed that the shrine maiden who was fleeing her duties would receive a Vision for doing just that.\nThis, of course, was the very first \"certification\" that Shinobu would receive — from a god, certifying her freedom.\nIndeed, Miyuki, who had intended to stop her at first, had a change of heart upon witnessing this sign, agreeing to help convince their parents.\n...It was also due to this that she would willingly surrender her Vision while the Vision Hunt Decree was ongoing.\nFor one thing, she did not intend to make life difficult for her friend in the Tenryou Commission, but for the other, the Vision was but one of her many, many certificates.\nMost things in life could, in any case, be settled without the use of a Vision, nor could the truly obdurate problems be dismissed simply by the dint of that device.\nRemoving generations worth of prejudice, for example, or searching for true, unbound freedom.\n...Or, you know, stopping those dolts in the Arataki Gang from chomping at the bit to \"help\" her win her Vision back."

When we do a prediction, we usually have to use multiple celestial globes and consult at least one whole year's worth of Star Charts to get any... precise answers.

She looked euphoric as I was settling the bill — I think she assumed I was some sort of mega-rich person. Kept relentlessly sending product ads to me in the mail afterwards. Ugh... biggest mistake of my life! I paid such a huge price for it...

            "More About Layla: III\tAlmost all of Sumeru's best and brightest have attended the Akademiya, and there are a ton of scarily intelligent international students, too... so you can imagine how competitive it is here!

            "More About Layla: IV\tShh, be quiet... Don't wake her up, just let her sleep peacefully. ...Who's \"her\"? Ah, well, a very weary Layla who's constantly stressed about her schoolwork, of course. ...And me? Hehe, I'm Layla too.",
            "More About Layla: V\tI've heard people say she thinks a \"blessing from the stars\" is the reason why all of her outstanding schoolwork gets magically finished while she's asleep. Ah, she has absolutely no idea. ...Oh, but seriously, don't tell her, okay?",
            "Layla's Hobbies\tDrawing Star Charts is really tiring work... I really don't think I'd be able to keep at it if it wasn't something I'm interested in. You have to use a ruler, then do some calculations on paper, then check past Starlogs... Before you know it, the whole day is gone. But then when I look at the finished product, a huge, neatly drawn, accurate map of the stars... it always gives me a huge sense of accomplishment.",
            "Layla's Troubles\tI slept okay-ish before I came to the Akademiya, but since I started my studies... there's so much pressure... I just want to be able to sleep the whole night throo-hoo-hoough...",

            "Least Favorite Food\tSomeone once told me about a mysterious merchant who was selling really effective Sleep Gummies. It cost all my scholarship money, plus all the other Mora I'd saved up, but I bought some. They worked great, and for a while I slept like a baby. But... they're 200 thousand Mora a box... I can't afford that... I—I can't let myself buy them ever again, nope, no way.

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tThe Rtawahist Darshan of the six Darshans under the Sumeru Akademiya is dedicated to the study of Illuminationism.\nEach of the Six Darshans focuses on a different field of study. Illuminationism, then, is centered around astrology and astronomy, learning of the cosmos that has clutched the world in its embrace since time immemorial.\nIt is among the researchers of Illuminationism that we find Layla.\nThough she has only recently enrolled, she has already earned a great many nicknames for herself.\nShe has been called the Sleepwalking Eccentric, the Human Calculator, and even the Heaven-Sent Thesis by those who know her.\nAs the days go by, her titles only seem to grow in number.",
            "Character Story 1\tThere are two kinds of people in the halls of Akademiya:\nThe first holds themselves with an air of calmness and mastery. Be it experimentation or dissertation, this type of person always makes whatever they're doing look easy.\nThe other kind of person wears their woes on their faces. Sighs spill from their lips as mournful notes while they clutch their tools, looking lost. Intermittently, they will jot something down before slashing it out, battling themselves all the way.\nLayla belongs to the latter category.\nBeing poor of health and bereft of sleep is not uncommon among researchers, but Layla takes it to a whole other level. The bags of exhaustion hanging beneath her eyes and weariness burned across her features make it impossible for her to hide the stress gnawing at her.\nShould someone approach her, they will often hear her whispering things like \"I don't understand,\" or \"why,\" and even whimpering \"I'm doomed.\" These lamentations often earn her looks of sympathy.\nThe halls of Akademiya exist not just as the altar of knowledge to dedicated students but also as the source of their nightmares. Countless among their number have suffered failed experiments and watched their dissertations get torn apart. Rumor has it that, unable to bear the rigors and pressures of school, many students each year choose to depart before they graduate, quitting before their journey is complete.\nAt first glance, Layla might seem like she hangs on the edge of departing herself, but in actuality, she has already outlasted several classmates who enrolled in the same year as her.\nWhen seeking knowledge, talent is useful, but perseverance is essential.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe reasons behind Layla's poor physical health and insomnia can be traced back to a single factor: academic pressure.\nAll students of the Darshans are required to commit to their studies, complete their essays, and pass their examinations or dissertations. Though this task sounds simple, simple does not mean easy, and the investment demanded of students comes in the form of time and effort.\nUnfortunately for Layla, she is always slower at finishing her papers than her peers.\nShe often spends a great deal of time contemplating, and worrying about the validity of her theses. Is the content overly simplistic compared to that written by her classmates? Are her calculations truly accurate? And if so, are they as concise as they can be?\nShe feels that, as a student of a most prestigious Darshan, she cannot slack in her studies. But at the same time, she dares not commit to her writings in haste.\nSeized by hesitation, time often slips from between her fingers, and leaves her staring at the blank pages of her work without having written a word.\nBecause of this, she often finds herself working through the night, and leaving sleep for the day. Yet, with the breaking of dawn, she often finds herself assailed by new assignments, causing her to descend into a vicious spiral.\nAs such, her habits have afflicted her body with abnormal side effects.\nNow, she often rises at night, wandering. Upon waking, she often finds herself unable to remember what she had done or where she had gone — the rumored symptoms of the phenomenon known as \"sleepwalking,\" described by her peers.\nFrom how her classmates have described her sleepwalking, it is as if she suddenly manifests with neither hint nor reason in a certain place. Mysteriously, none of them have been able to fully explain where she goes after or what she does either.\nBesides sleepwalking, she has also discovered another strange recurrence in her life.\nEach time she awakes from sleepwalking, she finds her unwritten papers from the day before fully completed, meticulous and accurate calculations included! Even the handwriting appears to be hers.\nStranger still, the author of her papers also has a habit of viciously critiquing the arguments and experimental methods of others.\nLayla simply could not fathom herself committing these acts, and found herself suspecting that someone was messing with her.\nHowever, upon recalling her experiences leading from her home to the halls of the Darshan, she could think of no one with proper motive.\nThe term \"Heaven-Sent Thesis\" is often used in Sumeru to describe an impossible miracle... and if what Layla had been experiencing did not count as a \"Heaven-Sent Thesis,\" she didn't know what did.\nDid a miracle truly grace her? Did the stars themselves, moved by her dedication to the study, repay her with a blessing?\nRegardless, \"The Stars' Blessing\" has solved several of her woes. Now, the papers she needs to write for several classes can be handed in without additional worry on her end.\nAs for the other details, well, that is probably best left for when she had the energy to care. Presently, she has classes to prepare for.",
            "Character Story 3\tAfter pushing through her heavy backlog of assignments, even Layla will find time to decompress.\nIn her spare time, she enjoys heading to Port Ormos by boat to wander its streets. There, traveling merchants and vagabonds place their stalls and practice their trades, offering all manner of interesting trinkets and showcasing amazing skills, infusing the perpetually exhausted Layla with a sense of refreshment.\nShe has witnessed the folk of the desert testing themselves in thrilling challenges of agility as they score bull's-eyes through distantly placed apples with thrown daggers.\nShe met a strange individual who claimed to be capable of flight; using a mere carpet, they managed to levitate off the ground.\nYet, the one who left the deepest impression on her was a stall owner that invited passersby to participate in a game of luck. Upon his stall, he separated colorful pages worth varying rewards into wooden boxes. In a display of astonishing speed and agility, the owner would shift these boxes about and shuttle them from position to position. Afterward, he would ask those participating in his lottery to pick a box.\nDespite not managing to claim the grand prize during her first few attempts, after a few more tries, Layla began to notice a pattern.\nThough the stall owner possessed blinding hand speed, she realized that his left thumb barely moved during the shuffling process.\nHence, she realized the box nearest to his left thumb would experience the least amount of deviations to its position.\nAfter achieving such comprehension, Layla managed to repeatedly win the grand prize. When the curious stall owner discovered how Layla used her insight to peer beyond the mirage of his speed, he found himself overcome with admiration for the girl and offered her a generous bonus reward.\nFor Layla, the reward was a thing of secondary importance. The true pleasure she got was getting to behold the awesome skills that other people possessed.\nUnlike the conservatives in the Akademiya, she did not look down upon the arts and trades of those who worked in the streets. Instead, she was thankful to all the vendors of Port Ormos for the happy memories they granted her.",
            "Character Story 4\tAs her first year in the Akademiya came to an end, Layla listed down her strengths and weaknesses, planning to write a personal assessment for herself.\nShe possessed good observation and estimation skills, and was consistently capable of tracking the shifting position of the cosmos via the star charts at twice the speed of her peers.\nAdditionally, she considered her skill in mathematics to be acceptable. When faced with simple questions, she could calculate the answers in a blink of an eye without even needing to do the equations in written form.\nBefore ever entering the halls of Akademiya, Layla had a chance encounter with her future mentor. Her mentor had complimented her then, stating that she was a child blessed by the stars with the thirst and capacity to seek true knowledge.\nIt was these virtues that gave her the courage and hope to seek education and wisdom in the Akademiya.\nHowever, upon stepping foot into the Darshan, she found that her strengths were paltry when compared to her peers of a similar age.\nOnly the best of the best could make it into the Darshans, and as such, Layla couldn't help but feel a bit overshadowed.\nAs for shortcomings, Layla found them to be too many to count. For example, her habit of fixating on problems afflicted her with a great deal of indecisiveness.\nMoreover, her ability to socialize was also lacking. When involved in discussions, she often struck others as aloof and arrogant due to her reluctance in expressing her views, which led to her having few friends in the Darshan.\nWhat diminished her confidence even further was the fact that among the many papers she has submitted, few were actually written by her. Instead, they were byproducts of having \"The Stars' Blessing.\"\nFrom Layla's perspective, she is an insignificant individual.\nWhat she does not know is that her teachers and peers have an entirely different perspective of her.\n\"Hey, being mysterious and eccentric comes with being a genius.\"\n\"How does she draw her star charts so fast while we're doing in-field surveys? Are her eyes kameras? Wait, she's done with the stellar orbits as well?\"\n\"I have reviewed her papers and calculations and found the work to be rigorous and thorough. Her logic is ironclad. And some of her ideas are so intricate that I, even as an educator, am surprised. We have a fantastic student on our hands.\"\nSome people will always tread forward through life weighed down by their caution. Viewing themselves as lacking, they will nevertheless strive on despite the misgivings they have toward themselves.\nPerhaps it is also this perpetual dissatisfaction that spurs them onward, allowing them to surpass their fellows without even noticing.",
            "Character Story 5\tThere was a girl who was determined, smart, and modest. Maybe even a little too modest.\nShe always felt that her meager gifts placed her leagues away from achieving true mastery.\nStill, she yearned for excellence, wanting to stand side by side with the greatest of minds, to make her teachers and family proud.\nContradictory desires chained her: She was unwilling to let go and unveil her true self, but also did not want to suffer the drudgery of a mundane life.\nWith the passage of time, she felt overwhelmed by a barrage of emotions. Shame. Listlessness. Yearning. All these things weighed upon her psyche and exacted their toll. Eventually, her soul found itself in need of a small outlet. Something to give her some breathing room.\nWhile her body and mind are awake and aware, she is too chained by woes to be free. So, it is when she slumbers that her deeper desires come alive to inhabit her vessel instead, indulging in bursts of short-lived freedom, gorging herself on all the expressions and indulgences that she denied herself while awake.\nWhile sleepwalking, she is beyond the claws of self-doubt and depression, allowing her to easily overcome things like writing papers, drawing star charts, and making Starlogs. Matters that usually mire her in indecision and worry become simple, allowing her to pour out her innermost insights and challenge highly complex questions.\nThis is the release of her long-held desires. But all dreams must come to an end. As her body wakes, she again returns to being the insecure, introverted girl that she was before. Indeed, after awakening, she can't even fathom that the wittily written papers and intricately calculated equations were created by her own hands.\nAs she is determined and modest while conscious, so too is she sharp and smart while sleepwalking. Both sides belong to the same girl.\nLike a sapling in growth, she is torn between self-doubt and the desire to break free. This imbalance was how her sleepwalking manifested in the first place. Yet, no matter which side of her is in control at the moment, the part that is Layla always remains.",
            "Layla's Photo Book\tBesides the hills of notes, star charts, and journals, Layla's desk also has a thick book filled to the brim with photos.\nNo matter what else occupies the space on her desk, her photo book will always take the most visible spot.\nThe photos that fill the pages of this book were personally taken by Layla. It contains pictures of her home and parents, her friends, and even the mentor who inspired her to get into the Akademiya in the first place.\nEach photo is a snapshot of significance to Layla. She uses these photos in place of a journal, detailing her experiences and trials that led her from her home to the Akademiya.\nEach time she goes through her collage of photos, she finds herself still able to remember the burning determination from her past and uses it to pierce through encroaching bouts of doubt.\nRecently, Layla added a new picture she had taken with a certain gold-haired Traveler. As the pictures accumulate one after another, who knows how thick the book might get by the time she finally graduates?",
            "Vision\tLayla, being a person of easy temperament, rarely gets into arguments with others. One time, however, she broke the norm and found herself engaged in a heated debate.\nDuring a discussion for a class on Theoretical Astrology, an esteemed Herbad skimmed over Layla and her classmates' papers, and then began to harshly criticize some of Layla's arguments.\nIn the opinion of the Herbad, Theoretical Astrology is a sacred field of study with laws and theories that have been long crystallized by the expertise of countless researchers across the ages and cemented irrefutably by generations of testing and calculations. For Layla to question and even dare to correct some of these pre-accepted notions was tantamount to blasphemy.\nLayla did not respond to the criticism in the heat of the moment, however. Instead, she listed her detailed arguments in a report after the seminar and submitted it to the Herbad.\nNot long after, the Herbad attached his refutation to Layla's report and returned it to her.\nBy this point, most students would choose to accept the status quo. In one respect, failing to get a passing score for their seminar report will result in major negative effects on their finals.\nFurthermore, it was most presumptuous for a student to argue matters of academic validity with a Herbad, for any Herbad was far more refined than a mere student, whether it be in terms of knowledge and seniority, after all.\nPerhaps the arguments Layla made questioning long-accepted doctrine were simply results of a miscalculation on her part, and she might have been humiliated in the end on account of being mistaken.\nEven so, she did not give up. She continued her discourse with the Herbad using her reports. Then, with the passing of half a year, the Herbad went to find Layla once more. He admitted then that after consulting more researchers, he had discovered a point of non-acceptability in the long-accepted doctrines that had been left unexamined by the broader community.\nAs he concluded his explanations, he told Layla with pride and emotion that the students who dared challenge him for the sake of knowledge have grown fewer by the year.\nThe inception of education, for student or Herbad alike, is to seek knowledge in its purest form. Layla, in her persistence, had reminded him, at length, of this pursuit of enlightenment.\nAfter the conclusion of the seminars, as Layla was going through the bag that held the documents she had accrued during her exchanges with the Herbad, she spontaneously discovered a gleaming Vision in the bag's depths.\nIt lay there upon a thick stack of notes, like a fallen star pressed into the pages."

            "Character Details\tThe librarian of the Knights of Favonius. In addition to her elegance and charm, Lisa is also highly educated.\nShe is said to have been the most talented sorceress to study at the Sumeru Akademiya in the last two centuries.\nIt is known that Lisa chose to return to Mondstadt after two years of advanced study in Sumeru, but the reason for her decision is not. At present, Lisa's job is to oversee the book collection in the library owned by the Knights.",
            "Character Story 1\tLisa is tasked with managing and maintaining the vast collection of books in the Knights of Favonius library, as well as ensuring that their potions are always fully stocked.\nThe only time that the citizens of Mondstadt see Lisa is when lending or returning library books.\nIn both scenarios, they tend to encounter Lisa sitting at the counter like a languid cat, yawning as she signs books in and out.\nAt times, her behavior causes people to doubt whether she is really up to the task of being librarian for the illustrious Knights of Favonius.\nNevertheless, it appears that she performs every task flawlessly, as her work consistently stands up to scrutiny.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe fact that Cyrus of the Sumeru Akademiya frequently refers to Lisa as their \"best student in two hundred years\" is all that needs to be said about Lisa's accomplishments in her studies.\nFrom outlandish forbidden knowledge, to the handling of elementally infused flora, to the most efficient methods of distilling wine... where there is a body of knowledge, the chances are that Lisa is acquainted with it.\nThis, paired with her ability to explain things clearly and concisely, makes Lisa the sensible person to approach for young knights and alchemists with burning questions.\nThat is, provided they go and see her at an acceptable hour.\nTo visit during unacceptable hours — such as in the morning while Lisa is sleeping in, or in the afternoon while she's enjoying her tea — can spell disaster for unsuspecting visitors.",
            "Character Story 3\tWhen people meet Lisa for the first time, they often find themselves overawed by the famous alumna of the Sumeru Akademiya.\nHowever, though her attitude to life may appear at first to be one of ruthless efficiency, it is in fact better understood as a product of her incorrigibly lazy nature, which drives her to avoid troublesome issues at all costs.\nBy negotiating with Kaeya, she offloaded the job of restocking and dispensing medication to Huffman and Swan, and had Flora start sending Donna over to deliver herbs on a daily basis.\nThe only tasks that Lisa handles personally are the categorization and management of books and other documents.\nThis is the one area where Lisa feels more comfortable handling the work herself rather than delegating it.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen Lisa first joined the Knights of Favonius, the Grand Master sought to appoint her as Captain of the 8th Company.\nThis was much to the consternation of the company's Field Officer, Nymph, who resented the idea of an academic coming in at such a high-ranking position.\nAt Kaeya's suggestion, a practice combat session was arranged in which Lisa and Nymph would both display their magical proficiency.\nTwo minutes into the session, Lisa graciously declined the captaincy on the grounds that \"Nymph manifestly possesses the requisite ability to fulfill the role.\"\nFor the whole year following, the Grand Master received a constant stream of referral letters from Nymph in relation to the captaincy, and the only person ever named in them was Lisa Minci.\nEventually, the Grand Master began turning over the referral letters to Lisa directly, but every time, Lisa would come up with an excuse to decline the offer.\nUndoubtedly, the 8th Company would have been far stronger under her lead, but she deemed that such a level of power was not only superfluous to requirements, it would also be risky for her in a way that most people could never appreciate.\nTo be clear, Lisa is quite confident that she could handle any situation she came up against. However, additional danger means an additional workload — and that is something that she would never be able to accept.",
            "Character Story 5\tHaving personally witnessed raving-mad scholars in the forests of Sumeru and powerful sages sitting underutilized on advisory councils, Lisa realized what uninhibited erudition can really do to a person.\nIt seemed such a high price to pay... How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge of all?\nPut off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.\nSince then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously.\n\"Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask.\"\nThese words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt. In each case, it was because she knew it was what they needed to hear.",
            "Special Heating Cauldron\tThe Special Heating Cauldron is a purpose-built cauldron made to a design that no one in Mondstadt could understand. It features time-delay heating, semi-automated ingredient insertion, and temperature regulation functions.\nLisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.\nShe boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.\nBut her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.\nAfter all, a relaxing afternoon tea session is by far the most important part of Lisa's day.",
            "Vision\tA Vision is a sign from the gods: a sign that you are one of those whom they have chosen to change the world.\nOr, maybe it's just one of the many hoops that one has to jump through on the path to unearthing the secrets of magecraft.\nAfter all, understanding the elements is essential to the study of magic, and practical experience is a far more useful means of acquiring this understanding than trying to assimilate the knowledge contained in dusty old books.\n\"Hmm... I suppose I shall need a Vision, then.\"\nAnd just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.\nWith the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.\nFor whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.\nThe Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.\nSo, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.\nPerhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions."

            "Lynette's Hobbies\tA person's mental state is like a bowstring. If it's constantly under high tension, it will be at risk of suddenly snapping.

The calmer one normally is, the easier it is to deal with crises when they do pop up.",

            "Character Details\tWhen asked who the most famous magician in the Court of Fontaine is, audiences will almost certainly think of the stylish, vibrant Lyney and his stage presence.\nBut if you were to ask after its most renowned magic assistant, people would scratch their heads and be at quite a loss to answer.\nThe adulation is not for her, after all, nor is the resounding applause directed at her skill and presence. As an assistant, she needs only misdirect the audience at opportune moments, ensuring the spotlight stays on the protagonist.\nWhether on or offstage, Lynette habitually hides behind Lyney, in shadows that neither lights nor compliments can penetrate.\nFor an assistant, keeping a low profile is a professional matter.\nAnd as for a child of the \"House\"... being cloaked in shadow is how one survives.",
            "Character Story 1\tLynette often uses phrases like \"standby\" and \"power-saving\" to avoid unwanted trouble.\nNow, if one were to use a term like \"idling\" to avoid work, one has an 80-90% chance of getting \"doesn't that mean you're free, then!?\" as a reply, followed by renewed haranguing.\nBut, say, if you were to very seriously proclaim yourself to be in \"standby mode\" to \"save energy,\" and combine that with a statue-like expression like Lynette's, you can stupefy the other party for a while.\nIt is through such momentary gaps that Lynette will calmly slip away, all the while wearing a most serious expression.\nThis method, of course, does not work on friends, but those who know Lynette well are more than aware of her dislike of work, and still more clear with regards to the... consequences of making her do errands.\nThough she might spout machine-related lingo often, that is about as far as Lynette understands machines.\nThere is a saying in her home: No matter what you do, do not leave her unattended in a room with the dishwasher, the vacuum cleaner... or any machine, really.\nFailing this, by the time a third party (usually Freminet) arrives on the scene, the machine will have suffered one of two fates:\nOne, it will have broken down, somehow — the dishwasher will foam at the mouth, the vacuum cleaner will suffer convulsions, all while Lynette stands amidst the disaster zone with an innocent expression.\nTwo, the machines are mercifully spared, but there has been no progress with the task, with Lynette cat-napping in a corner somewhere.\nConsidering that the result of any one incident is unpredictable, and neither result is desirable, Lynette has, to her relief, been relieved of all housework.\nIt is strange, however, that she is able to wreck even the simplest machines due to mishandling...\nYet, when onstage operating magical props, Lynette is even more focused than her brother, never having made a single mistake over the years.",
            "Character Story 2\tFrom a certain point of view, a \"magician's assistant\" is a contradictory sort of work.\nThe cheers and applause are for the magician, the protagonist, and similarly, the flowers and fame are not directed at the protagonist's sidekick.\nYet a brilliant performance cannot exist without an assistant's cooperation.\nAs the one closest to the magician onstage, the assistant knows all the magician's secrets, and in dangerous performances, the assistant's every move means life or death for the magician.\nOnstage, the magician and assistant are like a double-sided mirror. One tends toward the light, absorbing the audience's attention. The other faces the darkness, pulling levers and strings in the rear to complete the trick — each side turns the other in endless permutations.\nIf they are to operate in harmony, the assistant's skills cannot be far behind those of the magician themselves.\nBut with such skill, how could one long be content to live in another's shadow? Thus do many assistants, once their skills are fully developed, strike out on their own — they will not forever remain the pupil.\nWhen Lyney became famous, many notables took notice of Lynette's potential, believing that she could achieve greater stardom still should she become an independent act. Some even asked her to take up the role of a leading actress in their films.\nCat ears on young lady, who was also a magician... Even with those gimmicks alone, there was a fortune to be made!\nAlas, these passionate entreaties fell on deaf ears, and not only would Lynette reject them... She could not even be bothered to come up with reasons for doing so, instead leaving the task of coming up with them to Lyney instead.\nThis was quite the conundrum indeed, for many of those making requests were distinguished members of society. \"Father\" had left clear instructions — they were not to be treated with contempt.\nAnd if his authorship were to be discovered, any further meetings with them might turn awkward.\nSo Lyney had no choice but to write letter after letter of refusal in Lynette's manner of speech, filling each to the margins with polite and earnest words.\nEven one as silver-tongued as Lyney found it exceeding difficult to mimic her laconic manner of speech.\nExhausted in hand and spirit, glancing at his sister lounging on the sofa, Lyney could not help but think — why not try it for real? He could play the assistant, no problem.\n\"...Don't even think about it.\" Even that flicker of thought could not escape Lynette. She stretched, before flipping over to face him. \"I like being your assistant.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tBrewing tea is one of Lynette's few hobbies.\nWatching the steam swirl above the tea cup, getting a whiff of its elegant flavor, and the day's troubles all but melt away.\nWhenever a guest comes to visit, Lyney is usually the one who receives them, while Lynette waits with tea in the back. When words are had over tea at home, she is also usually the one who makes it while others do the talking.\nAs others discuss all manner of things or engage in light and idle talk, Lynette can be found sitting at the side, holding her cup in two hands, blowing on it to cool it before drinking in small sips.\nHer tongue is naturally sensitive, and she cannot drink tea that is too hot.\nBut to use merely warm water to make tea would be an abominable waste, and to add ice to tea, or pour the tea between two cups to cool it down... Lynette would consider such actions blasphemy.\nIce dilutes the thickness of the drink, and the pouring will affect its layered flavor... Only by blowing on it, puff by small puff of air at a time, may one achieve the ideal temperature, so as to neither scald nor be shorn of flavor.\nAnd once this ideal temperature has been achieved, one should not also drink it all immediately.\nSome teas have greater flavor as you near the bottom of the cup, and a wait of several minutes should be imposed after one mouthful before one may continue on and savor the next sip. That is why she always takes her time when drinking tea.\nBy the time the teapot is empty, the conversation is usually also just about over.\nAnd as for the teaware on the table... That might be best left to someone else, lest she wreck the dishwasher again.",
            "Character Story 4\tThere was once an official in Fontaine who wanted to investigate the cash flow of the Hotel Bouffes d'ete in the previous few months.\nHowever, no sooner had he finished drawing up a draft than his superior hastily called the whole business to a halt.\nThis poor official could never have imagined how this was due to a letter his superior had received, complete with an attached set of photos featuring a tryst the latter had enjoyed with a famous socialite.\nThis superior, too, could never have imagined that this secret had been exposed thanks to his whipping out a handkerchief that did not belong to his wife during a magic show.\nAt that time, he had been all too absorbed in the exciting goings-on onstage, thus failing to notice the gaze directed his way from the shadows.\nThis momentary distraction allowed Lynette to \"steal\" intel from him, all but picking him clean.\nPeople will unconsciously reveal themselves through their outfits, eyes, movements, and even the slight pauses and shifts in their tone...\nWhile most will be unable to get much out of such signs, buried as they are under many confusing details, Lynette is able to use her uncanny powers of observation to catch all such critical details.\nAnd after she connects all these seemingly trivial details, she can tease out intel useful to the Hotel.\nThese \"eyes\" of the Hotel, one in the light and the other in darkness, have stolen all manner of secrets from the famous in Fontaine. Nor have any of these people noticed the theft — to them, it may as well have been magic.\nAnd because she must maintain this razor focus while working, Lynette speaks little to conserve her energy and not divide her attention.\nEven in her daily life, or when she is at rest, she habitually filters out all kinds of useless information...\nThat said, what information counts as useful and what counts as useless is completely up to her.\nFor example, what about machine operating and housework-related skills? Why, if one never does them, one can safely and confidently tuck them away in the back of one's mind.\nAnd when caught up in teatime gossip, one merely needs to occasionally append the conversation with \"I see,\" \"Is that so,\" and \"And then...\" to ensure a smooth-running chat.\nEconomy of energy — just the way she prefers it.",
            "Character Story 5\tPeople often believe that Lynette's cat ears are a part of her performance attire, as the same blood flows in her and Lyney's veins, yet he appears no different from ordinary people.\nHowever, Lynette's ears and tail do, in fact, grow on her body — they are real as real can be.\nIt is said that these cat-like features are inherited, but that even as such a bloodline grows thin across generations, instances of \"atavism\" can still occur from time to time.\nWhen she was young, Lynette did not love this particular gift from her ancestors.\nThere would always be some curious kid who would, whether intentionally or inadvertently, point at them and ask her: Why are you different from everyone else? Are you and Lyney not real siblings?\nThe introverted Lynette did not know how to reply, nor could Lyney always be with her. Whenever such things would happen, she could only push her ears down, curl her tail up, and squat in a corner, by herself and beside herself with misery.\nOnly alley cats would come to comfort her, coiling around and rubbing against her ankles.\nShe could not let her brother see her like this, she knew. He already had a great many things to worry about — he did not need this kind of trivial matter on his mind as well.\nBut she could not simply pretend that nothing was wrong — to deceive the genius magician, she had to fool herself first.\nSo she hugged the cat tightly to herself, softly brushing the fur on its back. As she felt its light breath, calm slowly returned to her heart.\nBy the time the cat leapt from her arms, her face had regained its usual placid appearance.\nAmong Fontaine's nobility, there are also some novelty-seeking degenerates. During one party, a certain \"important person\" found themselves taken with Lynette's unusual appearance.\nOver her protests, despite her struggling, the siblings' foster father stuffed her into that person's carriage without a second thought, almost as if giving away a sofa-scratching cat.\nWhy her? Why was she born with these ears?\nIn her suffocating solitude, Lynette once again covered her ears in pain, unable to hold back the bitterness repressed over long years.\n\"Stop hiding. Cowering will get you nowhere.\" That voice shone through the darkness with the moonlight. \"Come out. The one who wished to harm you is dead.\"\nThat voice was cruel ice, and yet it had a spellbinding, comforting power also. Lynette lifted her eyes, and there she saw the person she would in later days call \"Father.\"\n\"You have good ears. Learn to use them.\"\n\"Father\" kneaded Lynette's ears. That touch was not gentle. Indeed, they were as cold as the moon's light.\nAnd like that light, it illuminated a corner of the darkness.\n...\n\"When a cat's ears are folded backward, that often indicates fear or vigilance, and if they stand up and point forward, that usually indicates a good mood...\"\nWhenever Lyney tells new members of Hotel Bouffes d'ete about the habits of ordinary cats, he will often steal a glance at his younger sister nearby.\nLynette's ears are straight, they face the front, and they occasionally flutter outward.\nIt has been a long time since she last folded them back.",
            "Non-Automated Feeding Machine\tThis is a made-to-order automated feeding machine that Freminet helped construct, intended to deal with the ever-increasing number of small animals at home.\nAfter a certain performance ended, Lynette discovered an abandoned box at the theater's back door.\nAs she opened it, a few kittens, barely a month old, raised their heads in alarm. Yet they had not the strength to flee, and thus could only stare into her eyes anxiously.\nLynette said nothing, nor did she reach out to further startle them. Instead, she simply looked back at them in silence.\nSlowly they seemed to come to the understanding that she meant them no harm, and eventually dipped their straining necks.\nOnly then did Lynette pick the box of cats up, and they laid down in silence, allowing this young lady to take them back to their new \"home.\"\nThere was some small debate amongst family members as to whether the animals should be taken in, but the usually reticent Lynette put her foot down, insisting that they stay.\nThe argument somehow managed to reach the ears of none other than \"Father,\" and she had the final word — which was that her children should cease the silly squabbling.\n\"Those who wish to raise them, do so yourselves — but do it well. Don't make trouble for others.\"\nAfter a short silence, she then added, \"And if you have not taught them how to follow the rules by the end of winter, get rid of them yourselves.\"\nThat statement put paid to the rest of the argument. As for the task of teaching the cats, it fell to Lynette.\nConsidering that Lynette was usually averse to busywork, Freminet had the automated feeding machine custom made.\nThe machine came with an internal clock and a weighing machine that could allow it to feed the kittens various foods at precise times and in fixed amounts.\nThis machine, in turn, became one of the few machines to survive Lynette's tender mercies, never breaking down across many years of service. Indeed, its inner components have remained spanking new, with only the plate beneath the food outlet showing much sign of use.\nAnd this... is because Lynette has never used it properly.\nThe sort of food to add into each box, how to input feeding times and amounts... Rather than memorize that, she found it more convenient to personally prepare the cat food in a plate.\nMoreover, if she had to leave even feeding to a machine...\nLynette squatted next to the Non-Automated Feeding Machine, stroking the satisfied cats' fur in silent thought.\n...How would she be able to teach these children?",
            "Vision\tWhen Lynette was young, she often heard stories about Visions from Lyney.\nThe protagonists of these tales seemed omnipotent, capable of summoning storms with a flick of the finger or dispelling dark haze with a puff of air.\nThose were not meticulously prepared magic tricks, no — this was the realm of true miracles.\nIf only we had Visions too, Lynette often thought.\nThen they could turn magic tricks into real magic. They could pull food to fill their stomachs or fire to keep themselves warm from a hat. Lyney wouldn't constantly be busy just keeping them both alive.\nBut the gods never answered her prayers. In the days that followed, she and Lyney would wander on, and after several twists and turns on the city streets and in noble mansions, they found a place to plant their feet, under the aegis of their \"Father.\"\nBoth of them knew how hard this chance was to come by, and so they endured the harsh training and supported each other through countless missions.\nReality had eroded their childish innocence all too early, and the dream of possessing a Vision, too, had fallen by the wayside, relegated to a long-gone past.\nDuring one particular mission, they were dispatched to perform at a noble's mountain villa in order to steal incriminating evidence that their target had hidden in a study.\nThe mission itself was ordinary, and it went quite well. During their performance, the two tampered with a window in the villa. Once the show was over, they would be able to re-enter stealthily and make off with the evidence without a trace.\nBut just as they thought they had succeeded, three flares went up in the forest outside the window — a message from their \"family members\" keeping watch.\nThree flares meant the worst-case scenario: that the Maison Gardiennage was also targeting this person, and indeed had already dispatched forces to the scene.\nIf they retreated the way they came, there was a high chance of encountering Maison personnel, and if they were exposed as having used their status as magicians to conduct their mission, not only would they be doomed, but their \"family members\" would be implicated as well.\nThe voices outside the study were growing louder — if they wished to escape as quickly and stealthily as possible, they would have to make a desperate gamble.\nThe villa retreat was built against the mountain, and outside the window was a cliff, beneath which flowed a swift river.\nLynette exchanged a glance with her brother, and without a word, they grasped each others' hands tightly, and leapt out the window together.\nThe rippling waves below slammed into Lyney with a terrible crash.\nHe had attempted to absorb the impact with his shoulder just as they hit, protecting his sister once again, but the shock of the collision with the water swallowed his consciousness.\nDesperate, Lynette grabbed onto a floating piece of wood, and by sheer dint of will managed to drag her unconscious brother to shore, coughing up water as she struggled on.\nFighting the searing pain in her lungs, she checked his condition in a panic. He was deathly pale, his eyes squeezed shut — there was no trace of his usual vitality to be seen.\nShe hugged him tightly to prevent his temperature from dropping further, even as she surveyed her surroundings. The forest was dark and gloomy, and under cover of night the twisted trees seemed even more malevolent.\nShe called his name softly, hoping that he might stand up again with a grin, just as he would do in their prior performances. But this time, the only reply she received was his weak and fragile breathing.\nThe same loneliness and fear of that fateful night so many years ago seized her heart once again.\n\"It's been so long, and we've been through so much — I thought I had grown beyond this!\nWhy, then, is it just like that night? Can I do nothing but wait under the protection of another? As I do nothing but tremble in the darkness?\nNo. No. It should be different. We made so many miracles by our own hands, conquered so many obstacles.\n...I wished so dearly, so ardently, to stand behind you, supporting you, back to back, shoulder to shoulder.\"\nThe Maison personnel could be patrolling nearby. She dared not call out to their \"family members,\" nor could they stay here.\nThe only thing she could do now was grasp Lyney's hand tightly, and haul him onto her shoulders.\nIf she could not see the way forward, then she would hear it.\nExtending her ears as much as she could, she listened intently for even the slightest wisp of wind.\nAnd then, as the breeze sang through the branches and through the bushes, and brushed against her face... and it gradually painted her a blurry picture.\nLynette groped forward in the dark, the thorns along the path piercing her skin, staining her clothes red.\nSlowly, the scene before her eyes became clearer. Perhaps her ears had grown used to listening to the wind, or her eyes accustomed to the darkness, but her steps grew more agile, more resolute.\nOn this stage without spotlights, in this performance without plaudits, Lynette had at last become the star.\nAs the rays of dawn lanced into the woods, Lynette carried her brother back to the rendezvous point of their \"family,\" only to encounter someone wholly unexpected — their \"Father\" had arrived, having especially made the trip in person the previous night.\nUsing the last of her strength, Lynette retrieved the sodden evidence from her bosom, but before she could hand it over, her legs gave out, taking Lyney down with her as she collapsed.\n\"Father\" grabbed them both, allowing the incriminating information to fall to the earth and be soiled.\n\"Sleep now. You've retrieved... a far more valuable prize.\"\nA Vision, reflecting both the dawn sun and the twins' sleeping faces, hung at Lynette's waist, glowing silently."

The way I see it, the point is not to perform perfectly, but to stay calm at all times and adapt as needed. Even if some small flaws occur, you just need to make the audience believe that it's all part of the show, and you'll still deliver an entertaining and unforgettable performance!",
            "More about Lyney: III\tAs orphans without parents to shelter us, Lynette and I were forced to roam the streets since childhood, so we've been through a lot. But those experiences have also made us who we are today. We're doing alright these days. I have a hat full of hopes and dreams... Heh, and a family, and audience, hoping that I don't let them down!",
            "More about Lyney: IV\tHaha, so even now you still don't completely trust me, huh? You're a vigilant one — not that that's a bad thing. I'll never need to worry about you getting duped by someone else. But on the other hand, since you've taken it upon yourself to watch my every move, you'd better be careful when you blink... Who knows, I might just tell a huge, terrible lie while you're not paying attention! You'd be in a real pickle then, wouldn't you?",
            "More about Lyney: V\tActually, the real me is nowhere near as outgoing or chatty as I appear. More often than not, I only work my verbal \"magic\" as a means of getting closer to people.

But there was once when a few didn't return, and by the time we tracked them down, they'd been turned into dove pie. Even now I still don't know how to give them both freedom and safety.",
            "Favorite Food\tSee this fishbowl? Come, put your hand inside it. Filled with just ordinary water, right? Are you sure? Then let's begin! See this cloth? I'm going to cover the bowl with it and... Well, what do you know? There's a fish in there now! How was that? Maybe this fun little performance could earn me one of your very own fish dishes?",
            "Least Favorite Food\tOur performances require that Lynette and I have matching physiques, so we have to avoid eating any oily food. Now, that's not a huge problem for me, but it can be tough for my sister — the fried fish they sell on the streets smells amazing, after all...",

            "Birthday\tI have a feather here, just an ordinary feather... Go ahead, you can hold it and see for yourself. Ready? And... boom! It was a party popper all along. Happy Birthday! See this? I caught one of the paper streamers floating down. Now, make a wish and picture a birthday gift in your mind's eye as I light it. Three... two... one... Great! Verrry good, I know exactly what you were thinking now. The last step, put your hand inside my hat... Well? Is it the gift you wanted?",

            "Character Details\tThe people of Fontaine love their tales of mystery. The intricate case setups and unexpected twists and turns are captivating for all.\nMagic recreates this experience under the converging spotlights. For the price of a ticket and some of your free time, you can embark on a wondrous journey amidst thunderous applause and astounded cries.\nIf you were to ask around as to which of Fontaine's \"guides\" is best at setting up such fantastical tours, most fans will tell you that it is Lyney.\nSuave, romantic, and talented, he performs miracle after miracle with a casual air.\nIn this industry, one needs only a stable of staple tricks to ensure a renowned reputation and comfortable life.\nHowever, Lyney's shows always feature some new trick. Some say that he was born into poverty, and the resultant burning hunger for fame and fortune drives his boundless desire to create.\nIn truth, he simply pursues novelty in his capacity as a performer — indeed, he feels that if he cannot put his whole heart into the show, his deep desire to perform cannot be fully satiated.\nThis is why, despite the applause rising to a fever pitch and beyond, he will rarely satisfy the crowd's calls for a reprise of his most well-known tricks. Some devoted fans consider this to be a bit of a shame...\n...And for them, such regret will only continue to increase each time they purchase a ticket and go in to watch his show.",
            "Character Story 1\tWhile Lyney first began his journey in magic to fill his stomach, he has continued to perfect his art even after becoming a person of some renown in Fontaine.\nMagic, after all, has been his benefactor. Not only has it allowed him and his sister to survive, but it has also allowed them to gain the \"acknowledgment\" that most children, growing up in a loving home, would have received from their parents.\nEven from an early age, performance was something closely tied to Lyney's life. Each time he would go on stage, Lyney would have the audience whooping and clapping. And yet, he did not lose himself in their adulation — if anything, it often troubled him.\nIf audiences were simply drawn to the spectacle of magic, then who was to say that they wouldn't abandon Lyney's stage as soon as they caught wind of a more enthralling show in town?\nIn other words, just as an audience would be attracted by petals and cards, they would also be pulled away by grander fireworks and crackling gun salutes. What else did magicians have up their sleeves to capture the hearts of their audience, beyond enticing them with ever more grandiose impressions of shock and awe?\nIn all of Lyney's performances afterward, audiences would begin to notice a change — Lyney would add many segments between performances in which he would interact with them.\nIndeed, this magician seemed without any airs, sharing various fascinating anecdotes about his life, not even minding if the audience should try to guess at the secret behind his tricks.\nOf course, the sharper wits amongst them would notice that Lyney's tales were not truth, but instead a way to build up the atmosphere, a bedding laid for a greater magic trick to land upon.\nYet no one would quibble about these white lies. After all, truth and falsehoods were already inextricable in many parts of the performance — why, even the magician himself could be said to have become a part of the magic.\nThus does Lyney sometimes appear near and dear, and other times just out of the reach of his audience, balancing human affinity and magical mystery perfectly in the palm of his hand, his smile leaving the audiences' imaginations free to run wild.\nNo matter how rich or poor, sad or glad the audience member, imagination is the great equalizer, carrying the charm of magic to all.\nThus did the mystery and elegance of this magician spread far and wide, with people even opining that his skill at creating an atmosphere is itself as exquisite as magic.\n\"Is that so? Well, I'm just trying to invite everyone to take a brief break from reality, that's all.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tLyney's new home was the Hotel Bouffes d'ete, located in a corner of the Court of Fontaine.\nThe place was home to many orphans who shared similar experiences with him and his sister. The people here helped each other like a family would, greeting the fallout and consequences of those tragic years together.\nBut the siblings, even with a recommendation from the manager of the Hotel, did not find it all that easy to fit in, nor was it easy for the children there to immediately accept these new \"outsiders.\"\nAnd in this environment, oppressive in its gloom, the water pumping equipment broke while Lynette was using it, right before everyone's eyes, deepening the distrust to the extreme.\nLyney could only step up and take responsibility, agreeing to fix the equipment so as not to affect everyone's daily lives.\nIn truth, he did not know all that much about repair work, but given Lynette's propensity for damaging various small devices, he had long gotten used to following his intuition to do some fixes here and there.\nUnfortunately, he underestimated the complexity of the pumping equipment and difficulty of fixing it. While he succeeded in restoring it to normal operations, he remained at a complete loss as to whether he had solved the root problem or not, he could not tell.\nBut just as he was at his wit's end, a seemingly reticent young fellow stepped forth, examined, and restored the facilities, even expressing his apologies.\nAs it turned out, he was the one in charge of maintenance at the Hotel, and as he saw it, Lynette had been the unfortunate victim of his failure to detect and replace the aging components in the system in a timely manner.\nLyney, for his part, was far more impressed by the young fellow's skills than any talk of responsibility. He wanted to learn from the youth — if nothing else, this would make helping Lynette all the easier.\nThe youth was, for his part, no good at refusing, and thus did Lyney become his assistant in the Hotel's small workroom — and over time, he and this Freminet would become friends.\nLyney would prove unselfish in spending time on other Hotel residents, whether it be Freminet or others, but he would keep them company in comforting silence rather than ask them about their experiences.\nIn this he was guided by Lynette's succinct life advice: \"No one needs self-satisfied concern.\"\nIn time, the residents became more willing to share some of their pasts with him, and Lyney would thus become better able to help them with their issues.\nFreminet was somewhat perplexed by this, believing that Lyney, who was slowly becoming the core around which the Hotel spun, did not need to go this far.\nLyney joked that he had helped Freminet when they first met because he knew that his sister would cause further machine-related troubles down the line, and he was uncomfortable with that.\nBut at this point, there was no fooling Freminet with such words. Under his attentive gaze, Lyney could only tell him the truth.\n\"Because Lynette's my one and only family, I've learned from her how one should treat all members of their family.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tOn the Hotel Bouffes d'ete's Founding Day, all the children were abustle, draping festive colors all over the place.\nTo the residents, outside festivals and events were cold and emotionless things, foreign elements in their lives, and only this dwelling could bring them true warmth.\nEveryone worked in concert to execute Lyney's plan. Lynette had purchased large amounts of festive ornaments, and together with the other children, she strung up colored streamers and hung handwritten festive greetings.\nFreminet was ensuring that the magical props would operate properly — Lyney had faith in his craftsmanship, so much so that Freminet was completely entrusted with all the magic props this time.\nLyney himself was the busiest of all — not only did he have to ascertain everyone's progress, but he was also laying the final groundwork for a grand, unique magic trick in secret.\nAnd thus was the banquet successfully held with everyone's support. The children danced to the joyous music playing from the grand hall's phonograph and enjoyed delicious food — this was the birthday of no one in particular, but this was the day they all felt they had gained new lives.\nThe finale, of course, was Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet's Founding Day magic show. The magic box was at the center of the room, and all waited with bated breath.\nTo preserve the secret behind the magic trick, even Lynette and Freminet knew not what was within. But as the room darkened and all eyes turned to Lyney, standing as he was in front of the box, even the highly-experienced magician showed some rare signs of trepidation.\n\"Now, you might consider the following words an exaggeration, but the \"present\" I am about to present to you all is, without doubt, the most important one we have received in our lives.\"\nThe paper firecrackers burst, and the once-empty box suddenly opened by itself. The crowd cheered, amazed — then fell suddenly into stunned silence.\nWhat stood onstage was no present — nay, this was the Hotel's manager, its owner, and their \"Father.\"\nHer image was one of unsmiling dignity, and thus, though she did not come by often, no one dared to horse around whenever she was around.\nSurely, Lyney had gone completely mad to have her make her appearance in such a frivolous way.\nYet, upon seeing the crowd's reaction, \"Father\" did not snap at anyone, opining merely that Lyney had kept this secret perfectly, just as a magic show should, declaring it worthy of praise.\nThat night, the children and their \"Father\" delighted in the various desserts together, and she personally sliced a serving of cake for each of them, which she herself enjoyed some of as well.\nPerhaps the most amazing aspect of Lyney's Founding Day magic show was its ability to have even \"Father\" lay down her heavy burden and enjoy a brief moment of familial love.",
            "Character Story 4\tMagic and secrets piled up at Lyney's feet, growing ever taller like a tower. Gazing down from the top at the people as they passed by in the world below, Lyney knew there was no going back.\nBoth the dazzling sleights of hand and the missions he would come to receive from Hotel Bouffes d'ete had made a habitual liar out of him.\nAnd while lies could sometimes be useful for seizing an advantage, they were more often employed to keep more people from being dragged into trouble.\nLyney knew very well that once trust had collapsed, the scales of judgment would no longer remain impartial, and even noble goals would become twisted and thought of as evil.\nAs such, not revealing more than was absolutely necessary was prudent when working with others. More often than not, this makes things go more smoothly, with everyone getting the results they want.\nBut lies will not simply scatter on the wind, and Lyney must maintain this illusion with utmost care, all the while keeping his distance from those affected.\nAs so the tower extended towards the skies, until there would be no one to take his hand if he reached out, and even their visages blurred in his eyes.\nFalsehood was Lyney's constant and only companion on the path that he walked, and this road was long and lonely — this he was always clear-minded about.\nEveryone knew the brilliant \"Great Magician Lyney,\" but they loved only the mystery, the romance, the unattainable nature. They knew no love for the heart that lay deeper within.\nHe felt he had no right to pour out his mind to others, and yet he must carry on with gritted teeth, for the price of a fall from such heights was more than he could bear.\nHaving played too many parts, even Lyney would sometimes find himself questioning who \"he\" really was.\nHis dreams often took him back to the tower, where his resting place at the pinnacle vantage would grow smaller and smaller, and with the fog of death they called \"betrayal\" extending all around, there was nowhere for him to go.\nBut just before he could plummet, a hand grabbed onto him — and from it, he felt a familiar warmth that drew his soul back into his body, steadying \"him\" within himself once more.\n\"Thank you, Lynette...\"\nThe awakening youth mumbled to himself.",
            "Character Story 5\tWhile Hotel Bouffes d'ete's operations in Fontaine work toward a just cause, its methods can often be radical. Only the influence of \"Father\" and her control over the inner workings of the Court of Fontaine prevent any serious incidents from occurring.\nThere was once an official funded by Lyney who served in the Maison Gardiennage. This person provided both intel in support of the Hotel's operations and scrubbed clean the effects of some of the Hotel's clandestine actions.\nThese were actions that came with no small risk, but the official always performed them well, for he believed that the Fontaine of the present day needed someone like \"Father\" who could bypass the many layers of laws and regulations and take direct action.\nLyney once joked to him: \"I'll be there if you ever need help, and if you're in danger, I'll come to rescue you... Well, don't expect too much of that last bit. Just stay on guard, alright?\"\nThe official knew that this was Lyney's way of expressing concern, of course. Yet even words spoken in jest could prove prophetic later, and so they did — this official's deeds were eventually discovered, and on the brink of capture, he used an emergency communication device to send a message to Lyney.\nUpon discovering the device, the Gardes who arrived at the scene mocked the official's naivete, claiming that the signal sent merely informed his compatriots to save themselves — no one would be stupid enough to try to save him.\nThe official's reply was also quite simple — even such an ending would have been fine for him, for he did not believe that his prior cooperation was the wrong decision.\nBut just as the Gardes were about to arrest the official, thick smoke began billowing forth from dispensers pre-planted nearby, and the official caught sight of a brilliant blaze—\nThe next moment, he was in the drink in the Fleuve Cendre, and was rescued by Freminet.\nIt was said that the Gardes spent a great deal of time chasing after the skyborne flame-trail, believing that the criminal must have used some flying machine to flee the scene, only to discover later naught but wood dressed in clothes, affixed to a glider.\nIn truth, Lyney had earlier used this device to draw the Gardes' attention away before getting the official out of his predicament.\nThe official admitted that he had not had high hopes when pressing the device. Magicians were untrustworthy, after all — but still, he had chosen to gamble on that tiny chance.\n\"Haha. Well, it is indeed a gamble to place your trust in others.\"\n\"But don't worry. Magicians might be full of hot air, but we will never betray the expectations of our audience.\"",
            "Rosseland\tThere is a special entity amongst the cats adopted by Lyney and Lynette, and its name is \"Rosseland.\"\nEvery cat in the Hotel has its own territory, but Rosseland has a special affinity for Lyney's hat.\nA hat is a magician's most important prop, and each time Lyney must use it, he must first chase Rosseland out — a difficult affair when its displeased meows in response are so heartrending, especially to siblings like Lyney and Lynette, who themselves once struggled to find a home.\nThus the siblings began their search for a replacement, only to be met by refusal each time, no matter how lovely the new home — indeed, Rosseland would not even give them a second glance.\nLyney even specially commissioned an identical hat, thinking that this might put an end to the cat's choosiness, only for Rosseland to lay claim that new hat also, becoming aggrieved no matter which was whisked away.\nBut this was no feline tyranny. Indeed, Rosseland's requests were not terribly excessive. After much thought, Lyney eventually came up with a solution — to incorporate the cat into his magic shows.\nHe and Lynette constructed a little puppet inside the hat that would normally serve as Rosseland's cushion. During performances, Rosseland would burrow inside the puppet, causing it to jink this way and that in a mischievous and adorable manner.\nAnd as it turned out, Rosseland was not at all shy — indeed, it greatly enjoyed its new job. Perhaps the spotlight brought it much enjoyment indeed, for it would never prove quite so predisposed to exclusive ownership again, even when it had to temporarily leave its nest when off-stage.\nDuring one of his shows, Lyney once made a rare error, having left a card he needed to produce on-stage backstage.\nWith all eyes on him, he had mere seconds to think of a way to save the situation while maintaining his easy-going demeanor.\nBut to his surprise, there was an unexpected weight in his hovering hat — it should have been empty, but Rosseland had somehow found its way inside.\nOut came the puppet, and out with it came the card Lyney had needed, to the instantaneous applause of all. Lyney heaved a sigh of relief, but he was also quite shocked, in truth.\nSome thought was put into this matter — but Lyney could only conclude that Rosseland had, influenced by the twins as it was, also mastered the art of the magical performance somehow.",
            "Vision\tAfter Lynette gained the favor of the gods, the missions she had to undertake grew more dangerous and difficult.\nOnly Vision-wielders like Lynette could fulfill the most dangerous missions while remaining completely anonymous, and the twins began to operate separately more often as a result.\nLyney found himself unable to adapt to this. Not only had the siblings been together since childhood, but he knew that he was not the only one who felt disturbed by this split.\nHe still desired to be beside her, lending her all the help he could — this was his non-negotiable desire.\nKnowing his desire for power was no longer pure, Lyney concluded that he had become undeserving of divine favor. Yet he still desired a means to bridge the vast gulf in strength between him and his sister, which he did not possess. Unless...\nTo this end, he solemnly sought out \"Father,\" expressing his belief that he needed the mysterious and perilous might of a Delusion to operate alongside his sister.\n\"Father\" was silent for a long while, till at last two slanted crosses pinned him in place with a wrath rarely shown to the children of the Hotel, her gaze seeming to pierce his very soul.\n\"And would Lynette want you to do this?\"\nHer simple yet powerful question cut through the strings that bound his heart, and in a daze, his sister's words once more reverberated in his ears.\n\"No one needs self-satisfied concern.\"\nLyney did not need to ask his sister to know that she would never accept his desire to stay by her side with the use of a Delusion. It was only then that he realized the absurdity of his wish.\n\"Father\" stood up and left, but not before reminding him that this was not the first time he had lacked power, but that he had found an answer before.\nLyney would lock himself in his room, trying to digest the reasoning behind the words \"Father\" had left him with. When he and his sister had been out on the streets, the answer he had found then had been \"magic.\" What, then, would the answer be now?\nLyney found the dossiers for all the missions Lynette had taken up during this period, carefully analyzing the process of each one and modeling his sister's every action.\nWas it really necessary to pass through this dangerous valley to get close to a target?\nWas it really a must to leap into such a swift river to flee the scene?\nNo, this was just the Vision's light covering her.\nThus did Lyney start to make comprehensive plans for his sister's missions, using his understanding of her to design the most suitable routes, make the most practical tools, and choose the best rendezvous points.\nThe trust between them did not change. The look in Lynette's eyes when she left was no longer so strained, and they often embraced heartily and happily when meeting at the rendezvous point.\nThe pure desire to protect one's family would not be moved, gods' favor or no.\nBut even the best laid plans of mice and men may go awry. After conducting dozens of successful missions, the children of the Hotel were caught up in a betrayal, and as a result, Lynette's movements were exposed.\nBefore the siblings was a towering cliff, just like the night when Lynette had gained her Vision — but this time, it was Lyney's turn to reverse their fortunes in a moment of crisis.\nHe opened his emergency paraglider, and grabbing her, threw himself off the edge. But their pursuers followed, raining gunfire down on them.\nLyney twisted this way and that, avoiding many a shot, but still the glider was punctured in several spots. Unable to maintain balance, they began to plummet downward towards the embrace of the ground below.\nStill, Lyney grit his teeth and refused to despair — should fate itself conspire to refute the answer he had come up with to protect his family, he would defy it to the end.\nTheir pursuers began to snicker, knowing that a fall at such speeds would be fatal — only to have a flame light up the skies, pushing the stricken glider toward a fast-flowing river nearby.\nThe power of Pyro changed the direction of their fall, while Anemo defended them from harm — and thus did the twin lights intertwine and spread under the moonlight, fading slowly like the applause that fills the stage during a curtain call.\nLyney did not guess at the meaning of the shining Vision he saw in his hand. The answer was, after all, no longer important."

Since many super powerful people would also have a bad temper, I was afraid that if I misspoke, you might get upset. But luckily, you two are really nice, and I have nothing to worry about!",
            "About Us: Speaking in Code\tSome forward scouts will use the word \"Octave\" to indicate that they've run out of arrows and are returning to camp... Or \"Vera\" to mean \"the conditions are good, we should engage the enemy\"... Hey, why don't we also come up with some code words? It'll come in handy, especially if we'll be working together long term. Go ahead, I'm good with any of your ideas!",
            "About the Vision\tTo be honest, even I was amazed that I managed to receive a Vision. It's really come in handy, but I shouldn't completely rely on its powers. Instead, I prefer to think of it as a sort of safeguard to use in case something happens. As a member of the Knights of Favonius, I should place more importance on team cooperation, and come up with ways to overcome difficulties together with my teammates.",
            "Something to Share\tHere's a simple survey trick that you might find useful... Stretch out your arm, and raise your thumb towards the target area. Align your right eye's line of sight and your thumb to the left side of the target, and your left eye to the right side of the target, and multiply the distance between the two sides by the right multiplier... You can use this trick to estimate the height of a mountain and whether it's climbable, or the width of a river and whether you can swim across.",
            "Interesting Things\tI heard Klee mention that there's a type of plant that can relay sound... if only we could somehow carry this plant with us in the field. That way, I could instantly report back about the terrain... I could even stay near the front lines and guide our rear forces to attack enemy targets from afar with volleys of arrows.",
            "About Kaeya\tBefore joining the Knights, I had to take a number of exams. Captain Kaeya was the main person in charge of all the testing. He was really supportive, and gave me all kinds of tips, but sometimes, I would struggle to understand what he was saying... I would get worried that I was not keeping up with his pace, and that I was letting him down...",
            "About Varka: Instruction\tGrand Master Varka is not only a strong leader who commands respect, but also my personal combat instructor. He taught me to think on my feet and avoid engaging enemies at close combat to make up for my small stature and relative lack of stamina. Following his advice, I learned how to fight with a polearm and crossbow, and I must say, this fighting style is far more suitable to me.",
            "About Varka: The Captain\tThe Grand Master said that I need to set higher goals for myself, and strive to achieve them. I've always had that kind of attitude, but it wasn't until I was on the expedition that I realized how serious things can become... One day, I met the Fatui Harbinger known as The Captain. I can't even begin to imagine how I can deal with an opponent like him. I just... Such powerful people are really on a level of their own, I'm not even remotely close...",
            "About Jean\tThe Deputy... I mean, the Acting Grand Master is a strong and considerate leader who always makes me feel at ease. She's always out there looking after all of us. Whether it's organizing work, rendering first aid, or cooking delicious meals, there's so much I can learn from her...",
            "About Amber\tOh? Amber the Outrider? She's the most reliable vanguard, and has amazing reconnaissance skills! The roles of Front-Line Surveyors and the Outriders are similar given that we both operate ahead of the main force. Amber has a lot of experience, and I've learned a lot of survival skills from her, as well as how to better maintain my crossbow strings and arrows.",
            "About Eula: Tasks\tCaptain Eula is a strong fighter with a combat style of her own, and she's always looked out for me. When I first joined the company, she assigned me a variety of tasks, way more than what other members had, and that quickly improved my ability to adapt. Once I grew accustomed to the way she expresses herself, I was able to work together with her just fine!",
            "About Eula: Daily Conduct\tActually, I really admire Captain Eula. She is friendly and free-spirited, and her mental fortitude is out of this world. If other people gave me strange looks all the time and talked behind my back like they do about her, I don't think I'd be able to leave my room...",
            "About Lisa\tOur librarian Lisa had always offered her help when I was first teaching myself how to draw maps. She even found a bunch of useful books for me to study. *sigh* If only I could be as well-learned as she is... After all, it never hurts to have more knowledge, and you never know when you might need it...",
            "About Klee\tOh? Klee? She's super cheerful, and I've heard that... she's as strong as the Grand Master himself. She's invited me to go on adventures with her before, and we always had a great time together! Although she would experiment with dangerous weapons from time to time, which means I've had to revise my maps on several occasions... But I still feel it's worth it!",
            "About Venti\tI really like that bard... He's a very talented performer, and his melodies always seem to make me feel at home. If I had to pick a tune that best represents Mondstadt, it'd definitely be one of his. It's too bad that I'm not often in the city, otherwise, I could bring him some gifts every day...",
            "About Albedo\tThe Chief Alchemist has been very kind to me. He helped me make all the survey equipment I use in the field... I even have some pens he made that will work even when I'm hanging upside down from a tree. But it seems that making artistic sketches is quite different from making maps. I've tried to make some sketches of a target area as supplemental intel before, and word has it that Captain Albedo went silent for a long time when he saw them...",
            "More About Mika: I\tHmm? You want to know more about me? Well, I'm just an ordinary person, so I don't really have any interesting stories... I guess all I could talk about is my experiences, would you be willing to hear about that?",
            "More About Mika: II\tEver since I was a kid, I've wanted to become a cartographer, and map out every corner of Teyvat. It's only later on that I discovered the Knights of Favonius actually have that kind of role. Thanks to my father and brother's support, I was able to make it through the selection process and become a Front-Line Surveyor. This job has let me live out my dreams, and it's already brought me lots of fulfillment.",
            "More About Mika: III\tEveryone in the Knights of Favonius is really strong, and I feel like there's something I could learn from each member. After gaining new skills from everyone, I should also do my best to return the favor. So if there's anything the others need help with, then I'll do my best to make that happen.",
            "More About Mika: IV\tIt seems like... after I assisted the Grand Master and Captain Eula a few times with their errands, some members of our group have begun to see me as their official messenger. If I ever misspoke, it would cause trouble for our leaders, and the blame would be all mine. So, whenever I am around others I'm unfamiliar with, I often try to only comment on things I'm absolutely confident in, which makes everyone think I'm timid. But would you say this whole situation is just a sort of misunderstanding?",
            "More About Mika: V\tYou know, one good thing after coming back from the expedition is that I don't feel so worried anymore. As long as I'm not causing trouble for anyone else, then I don't really mind what anyone might think of me. The Knights of Favonius is like my second family, and I've got to master my work as a Front-Line Surveyor. My hard work can let everyone finish their tasks more smoothly and end their days with just that much less to worry about...",
            "Mika's Hobbies\tOh? My hobbies? ...I guess my favorite thing would be camping out in unknown territory. Just taking in the fresh scenery, making a cozy little camp, starting a bonfire and making some food. It really brings me happiness!",
            "Mika's Troubles\tTo be honest, I'm not too good at dealing with people I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's because I'm not really good at holding a conversation. Can you give me some pointers in that area?",
            "Favorite Food\tThe Grand Master said that a youngster like me needs to eat more meat, which will build more strength and physical stamina. Even though there's little chance I'll ever get really buff. I do like eating meat dishes. The others in the Reconnaissance Company seem to share this taste as well.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tUnlike my brother, I can't stand the taste of alcohol. All it takes is one sip and I'd be out cold, and the others would have to go out of their way to take care of me. Even just the smell of a strong drink being opened is enough to make me dizzy.",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tThanks so much... this is such a marvelous dish, I would feel terrible using it just to fill my stomach! Can I put it away for storage?",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tThe taste and portions are both incredible. You really went the extra mile for me.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tUgh... well, since you went to the trouble of making this for me. I promise I'll finish it.",
            "Birthday\tOh, what should we do for an occasion like this? Hmm... Today is your most special day, so we should really live it up! I've prepared \"A Tour of Mondstadt's Most Stunning Spots.\" It contains information on lots of beautiful locations that are hardly known to anyone else. I wish you happiness every day until this day arrives again next year.",

            "Character Details\tWhenever he shows up at the Knights of Favonius headquarters, Mika always swiftly finishes any discussions to be had with his fellow knights, then quietly slips away to avoid becoming a hindrance to others' work.\nMika always gets nervous when someone strikes up a conversation with him, frantically scampering away right after politely putting an end to the idle chatter.\nThe knights know that the young man's name is Mika, and that he is Huffman's younger brother and the second son of the Schmidt family. They also know that he is a member of the Reconnaissance Company, but nothing much beyond that.\nFew are aware of what Mika's job entails, nor do they know that the widely-promoted, updated version of their military map is the fruit of his labors.\nThe new map consists of detailed statistical data regarding almost every corner of Mondstadt with practical markers indicating road conditions, areas with heightened monster activity, high ground that can serve as temporary strongholds, and the distribution of natural resources... The amount of detail could almost make your head spin.\nAll of this is the result of Mika's own labor throughout the two years he has spent traveling all across Mondstadt and investigating every inch of terrain he set foot on.\nKnights who have fought alongside Mika know that he finds using both lance and crossbow at the same time the most convenient, and his unique fighting style has left a lasting impression.\nHowever, they have also been solemnly \"warned\" by Mika to never speak of him to others unless absolutely necessary.\n\"Mika's terrified of drawing the attention of others — he'll get nervous if you so much as stare at him, to say nothing of showering him with compliments. He's been a great asset to the Knights and helped us out a lot, so respecting his boundaries is the least we can do as seniors!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tMika comes from a loving family. His mother works as an author writing about local conditions, his father is a retired Knight of Favonius, and his older brother Huffman is a current member in the Knights' ranks.\nWhen Mika began learning to read, his mother went inspiration-gathering abroad with his father accompanying her. During that time, the responsibility of looking after little Mika landed in Huffman's hands.\nHowever, Huffman had already made the Knights of Favonius his second home — he was preoccupied with work during the day and indulged in drinking with his friends night after night. With his own life lacking organization, how was he expected to take care of his little brother?\nSo it was little Mika who learned to take care of both himself and his brother whenever he'd return home drunk at night. When other children his age were enjoying their childhood without a care, Mika had already learned to stick to an organized schedule, sometimes even helping Huffman with his everyday chores.\nWhile they were away, Mika's parents always made sure to send a letter back to Mondstadt every week to keep their children from worrying. Mika's mother, being an excellent writer, could somehow describe the scenery she's seen in a mesmerizing way akin to fairytales. Mika loved to read his parents' letters before looking for their exact location and marking out their travel route on a map. Picturing his parents' wonderful adventures was Mika's favorite pastime.\nBefore long, Mika developed a passion for reading maps, and even committed the terrain of many locations to memory.\nUnfortunately, Huffman had to ruin the mood when he broke the bad news to Mika: \"I'm afraid your efforts have been wasted on the map Mom and Dad left us. It's very outdated, and it wasn't very accurately drawn in the first place.\" But that was to be expected. After all, those who with the ability freely explore the wilderness would likely have all become adventurers with nothing but commissions and Mora on their minds. To them, just about any map would do.\nOn the other hand, most of those who knew how to draw decent maps were not skilled in combat, so it would be much too dangerous for them to survey the wilderness themselves. Not to mention their limited income, which wouldn't allow them to afford bodyguards. Perhaps the time would come when the Knights of Favonius finally had sufficient budget to hire experts to deal with matters like these, but with Mondstadt as peaceful as one could hope for, no one knew for sure when something as trivial as cartography could be put on the schedule. So little Mika thought to himself: If he could reach every corner of the world just like his parents, and record every detail of the terrain beneath his feet... That would be the most fun ever.\nFrom then on, Mika set a clear goal for himself.\n\"I'll become Mondstadt's expert cartographer.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tWhen Mika's parents returned to Mondstadt, they were delighted to hear of Mika's new-found goal and promised to do whatever they could to support him.\nFrom that day on, Mika dedicated most of his time to poring over geography books and assiduously honing his drawing skills in the library.\nLisa took a liking to this polite, gifted yet hardworking child and often recommended books to him, guiding him towards the most efficient path.\nAfter some time, Mika gained Lisa's recognition — \"With your current skills and abilities, you just might qualify for studying at the Akademiya.\"\nIt was then that Mika began looking for opportunities to put his knowledge to the test. As it happens, Ella Musk, whom he had gotten acquainted with while studying at the library, happened to be looking for a guide for a language exchange trip to the secluded wilderness.\nAnd that became Mika's first real expedition. Though they did safely arrive at their destination, due to an error in Ella Musk's word choice, the pair ended up getting beaten by the hilichurls.\nMika concluded that this setback was due to his lack of combat prowess. \"I need to learn how to protect myself,\" he thought, \"or I won't be able to guarantee the success of my expeditions to unfamiliar areas.\"\nThereafter, Mika rode the momentum from his time spent learning in the library and began to learn fighting techniques from his brother. Luckily, Mika had a strong constitution and quickly grasped the basics.\nIt happened that the Knights of Favonius had just drafted their plan for an expedition set to depart three years later. They were still looking to recruit a few more members to fill some positions, and \"Front-Line Surveyor\" was among the open spots.\nThis role had strict prerequisites: those applying for the position should have some level of expertise in cartography, and due to potentially dangerous conditions, they would be leading the team from the front lines, making combat skills a must.\nThis was Mika's chance, but it all felt too much like a dream...\nMika initially believed that he would be invited into the team as an external consultant, but the position of Front-Line Surveyor would no doubt make him a full-fledged member of the expedition — and one crucial to the entire team. He was daunted by the thought at first, afraid that he wasn't worthy of such an important role that according to him, \"only the strongest would qualify for.\"\nHis doubts were soon dispelled by his father and brother's encouragement, and he remembers their words to this day:\n\"You don't have to ask too much of yourself. Doing your best to help will be more than enough.\"\n\"Most of the knights are just ordinary people like us, but once we put our strengths together as a team, even the strongest of adventurers would struggle to prove our equal.\"\nThus, Mika seized the opportunity and signed up for the position.\nHe felt reassured that he would, at least, be dedicating his time to what he loved.",
            "Character Story 3\tWord of Mika signing up for the expedition spread like wildfire throughout the Knights of Favonius.\n\"Huffman's little brother will be joining us! The little kid who always takes care of that drunkard will be joining the Knights!\"\nThe anxiety from unexpectedly becoming the center of attention made his breaths quicken as his heart pounded — Mika was afraid of failing the Knights' assessment and disgracing his father, ruining his brother's career, or worse, ruining the reputation of his family name.\nConsidering that many members of the Schmidt family had already joined their ranks, the Knights of Favonius decided to raise the bar for entry and make the whole assessment process public in order to make the selection as fair as possible.\nTaking real-life scenarios into consideration, lead examiner Kaeya came up with a series of challenges that strictly assessed the participants' abilities:\nHiking up Dragonspine while wearing full armor and carrying a heavy load;\nMapping out a monster-infested region without the aid of any reference material...\nLuckily, Mika came well-prepared and gave it his all, eventually passing the most difficult challenge and becoming one of three successful candidates.\nThe other two candidates had both received Mika's aid along the way as well — to him, they were more like future teammates than competitors, in any case.\nMika's excellent exhibition of teamwork gained the recognition of Grand Master Varka, who allocated the two other new recruits to the Cavalry Company and Investigation Team, while personally taking Mika in to go with him on his expedition.\nEvery week, Varka would teach Mika combat techniques and give him assorted \"homework\" to complete.\nMika would later join the Reconnaissance Company. Communicating with its rather unusual Captain further strengthened his communication skills, which would help him greatly when working with the elite knights of the expedition team.\nAfter joining the Knights, Mika honed his cartography skills while investigating dangerous locations as a Front-Line Surveyor while receiving pointers on how he might improve his other skills from Varka.\nThe diligent young recruit quickly became a calm and reliable knight — though it seems as though he has yet to realize that himself.",
            "Character Story 4\tAs Mika continuously refined his skills in real-life combat, he became a core member of the Reconnaissance Company in less than two years, completing countless missions alongside his teammates.\nThe scheduled date drew near, and the expedition team was soon about to depart.\nAt the send-off party, Grand Master Varka was pleasantly surprised by the shiny new Vision on Mika's right wrist. But after personally inviting Mika to spar, he concluded that Mika's current abilities were \"remarkable, but far from enough.\"\nMika didn't figure out what that meant until the expedition team entered a dangerous restricted area, where he finally saw with his own eyes the monsters Grand Master Varka had used as a reference when judging his powers.\nThose unnamable, wandering creatures could become a nightmare for any knight unfortunate enough to stray away from the team.\nThe speed of their scouts in the vanguard determined how fast the whole expedition team proceeded, so during the days when the team was the busiest, Mika could only rest for half an hour a day.\nIt was Mika's first time working under such high pressure, and he did so with great difficulty. Not to mention that apart from dangers of the unknown, the expedition team was under the watchful gaze of another party...\nOne day, when Mika was getting ready to call it a night, he received a warning from another scout that the Knights had encountered enemies.\nWhen Mika hurried on scene, Varka had already drawn up battle lines with his trusty subordinates.\nIn the depths of the pitch-dark night, Mika could vaguely make out a line of soldiers, silently standing there as if they were lifeless war machines.\nAnd right in the middle of the enemy formation was a dark, distinct silhouette. Even though torches lit the area, Mika could see nothing but their eerily dark blue eyes that seemed to glow with an uncanny aura.\nAt his teammate's reminder, Mika learned of their identity — the Fatui Harbinger known as \"The Captain\" and his direct, elite subordinates.\nAs it turned out, their vanguard had bumped into Fatui scouts and an altercation had ensued, resulting in both sides getting jumpy and continuously requesting reinforcements, eventually alerting their respective commanders.\nThe scent of gunpowder was thick in the air, the sense of crisis turned Mika's limbs numb and cold.\nHe couldn't help visualizing the confrontation escalating into an armed conflict, and what he should do if such a thing were to happen...\nThe Harbinger, in particular — Mika knew that he would be utterly helpless to parry a single half-hearted swipe from this person.\nHis jumbled thoughts and exhaustion made it difficult to breathe or focus.\nVarka, however, seemed completely unfazed. He greeted the Harbinger from afar and walked towards him with his weapon in hand. The Captain, too, signaled his men to stand by as he began slowly stepping forward.\nAs the tension between the two parties reached its peak, Varka and The Captain briefly conversed and seemed to reach an agreement.\nThe dark silhouette raised his arm, and the ghostly shadows of the Fatui soldiers silently turned and departed with him.\nThe Knights all heaved a sigh of relief, and some were even trembling with fear. But when Varka returned to the Knights' formation, he looked as relaxed as ever.\n\"Well, that was a surprise! If it weren't for our unique circumstances, I would've loved to invite him for a duel!\"\n\"And it's not like he's a stubborn fellow. He's well aware that engaging in battle in a strange and foreign land would've been disadvantageous for both of us.\"\nIt was only then that Mika realized they had been on the precipice of war, and conflict had been avoided only because the Grand Master had been there to prevent it.\nThe Captain's overpowering presence and the calmness with which Grand Master Varka handled the crisis both left a profound impression in Mika's mind.\nMika reflected on this experience for a long time and concluded that although he had been improving in strength, he still had a long way to go when it came to dealing with situations like that.\nThere was more to be done than just doing his best to help the team. He had to work harder to become a reliable Knight who could handle all manner of incidents...",
            "Character Story 5\tFortunately, Mika would not run into anything exceedingly dangerous during the expedition and smoothly made it past that most difficult period.\nDuring Mondstadt's Weinlesefest, Mika returned to Mondstadt with Grand Master Varka's letter and resumed his post in the Reconnaissance Company.\nThe members of the Reconnaissance Company were both excited at his return and surprised at the astonishing progress he had made — for he could now easily complete tasks that usually required three forward scouts.\nAnd considering that the Grand Master's letter had vaguely mentioned the Fatui, and that Mika had been a key member on the expedition under Varka's direct command... His teammates quickly connected the dots and a strange chain of logic emerged:\n\"Mika fought against the Fatui! Mika might've fought against Fatui elites! Mika must've fought alongside the Grand Master and won a battle against a Fatui Harbinger!\"\n\"How else could he have become this strong all of a sudden? Mika's our hero! He can now do anything for us!\"\nTruth be told, Mika had simply accrued a great deal of experience — the other Knights who had gone had also made progress to varying extents. They simply had yet to return, and thus no valid comparison could be made.\nMika didn't know how to deal with all the absurd rumors, and so he consulted Jean and Kaeya for advice.\nJean informed the leader of each company to remain rational and refrain from spreading rumors based purely on speculation. Besides, many matters regarding the expedition were considered highly confidential and should be treated with discretion.\nKaeya, on the other hand, seemed to enjoy joking about the rumors. Members of the Knights of Favonius all more or less held some sort of dislike for the Fatui, and a rumor that says \"Mika gave the Fatui a good beating\" could very well boost morale.\nWhatever the case, Mika felt greatly reassured now that the Acting Grand Master had been made aware of the situation and was comforted to know that he hadn't caused any trouble for anyone.\nHe reported to duty as usual and made sure he did all he could to help others.\nBut the exaggerated rumors couldn't be un-spread, and Mika has found that gaining too much trust comes with its own fair share of difficulties...\nRecently, more Knights have been coming up to him to borrow a new map, ask for help maintaining a weapon, or request a share of the Reconnaissance Company's field rations.\nAll of them seem to hope that some of his powers might rub off on them so that they can become stronger quickly, just like him.",
            "Multipurpose Front-Line Surveying Device\tAn intricate book-shaped device Mika carries with him wherever he goes.\nIt was developed by Mika and technicians from the Investigation Team, and its key components were made using Albedo's latest alchemical creations.\nA notebook is embedded in the device's interior that can be used to record information. Designed to facilitate the quick production and use of maps, each of its pages can be conveniently removed and replaced.\nAn elaborate pattern is carved on to the back panel of the device. Channeling elemental power into the carving will activate the prism-shaped component outside said panel, which will in turn fire a \"wavebeam\" towards a fan-shaped target region.\nThe distance between the device and the target region can then be accurately calculated using the time taken for the beam to bounce back. By increasing both the frequency and amplitude of the beam, the device will generate a sketch of a small area of terrain.\nThis function can greatly improve the accuracy of a map, but regrettably, everything else — including the statistical information and calculations regarding the terrain in question — has to be computed in the user's mind.\nOnly those with excellent spatial reasoning skills and an extensive knowledge of the target terrain are capable of making full use of this function.\nThus, Mika became the only Front-Line Surveyor who could use the device without difficulty, and its overall usage rate is not very high.\nThere had been other improved devices originally planned for distribution to other teams, but they have been put into storage, to be used as spare parts for Mika's device.\nThe device is Mika's trustiest helper in his work and a symbol of honor for being the best surveyor, but Mika has never once mentioned its impressive features to others.\nTo Mika, that feels too much like bragging, not to mention that it could potentially give Albedo extra work... Troubling others is the last thing Mika ever wants, after all.",
            "Vision\tMika was once in a life-or-death situation.\nThis was not long after he joined the Reconnaissance Company — the information on a certain area was no longer valid, and Mika had taken up the task to update the details of its terrain on his own.\nHe slowly crept into the ruins, only to accidentally knock off a piece of stone from the broken wall, alerting two Abyss Mages lurking in the dark.\nAs the flames intertwined, a rush of elemental power instantly engulfed him as if it was about to crush him into pieces and turn him into the monsters' next meal.\nPain and panic flooded his senses, and only one thought remained in his consciousness — he needed to escape and warn others.\n\"These monsters... They'd be a threat to even the most experienced members in the company...!\"\nIt was the responsibility of a front-line land surveyor to keep their teammates from dangerous situations like this.\nThe Abyss Mages shrieked in glee and were about to command other monsters to come out of hiding when a spinning spear tore the curtain of flames apart. An icy mist burst across the ruins, clearing the unbearable heat in an instant.\nWhen the Abyss Mages finally made sense of the situation, Mika had already fled far away, though still apologizing loudly enough for the monsters to hear:\n\"I'm sorry! I'll remember to knock before entering next time. That way, my seniors can fight you fair and square!\"\n\"Next time\" soon came — the Reconnaissance Company's main force were notified of the monsters and swiftly but cautiously eliminated the threat.\nThey were surprised to find that both of the Abyss Mages' shields had already become quite badly battered, and gazing upon the radiant glow from the Vision on Mika's right wrist, they seemed to realize something...\nThat day, the Reconnaissance Company's dinner was especially sumptuous. Everyone raised their glass to celebrate, while Mika himself seemed to be in shock, unable to wrap his head around what was happening."

            "Character Details\tTeyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business. Merchants move products, knights patrol, and farmers till the land.\nBut if one were to ask Mona — the enigmatic and prideful astrologist — what she busies herself with, she will reply by saying that she is servicing a debt known as \"life.\"\nShe will, however, vigorously deny being \"poor,\" giving the following explanation:\n\"Beautiful veneers may obscure simple truths.\nExquisite food may mask its nutritional value.\nOne lives simply, all the better to expose this world's truths.\"\nA frugal lifestyle, therefore, is a form of training to access the truth... Or so Mona will insist.\nTeyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business, and even an enigmatic astrologist must look to hers.\n—That said, it seems like bards might be the exception to this rule.",
            "Character Story 1\tRecently, Mona's teacher, an old but highly skilled female astrologist, has entrusted a very important task to her.\nHer teacher has an erstwhile rival-friend in Mondstadt, and she wanted Mona to retrieve a highly confidential box from that person's successor.\n\"If you dare look inside that box... Well, you'll see.\"\nThat was the warning Mona received before departing.\nTo Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.\nThe box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box.\n\"I—I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this...\"\nMona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence.",
            "Character Story 2\tMona's astrology utilizes hydromancy, and she once explained the underlying principles thusly:\n\"It is people's fate that shines in the night sky, and though its reflection in water is but an illusion, it reveals the truth nonetheless.\"\nNo one else can quite comprehend this principle, but Mona's ability convinces people to believe in it anyway.\nAlbeit, sometimes grudgingly...\nHer astrological readings are exceptionally precise, and she will neither lie nor hold anything back when revealing the results of her readings.\n\"Your son says that he's made it. That's a lie.\"\n\"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you.\"\nThe cold, hard truth is laid bare before people' eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.\nMona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.\nBut sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.\nThere, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky — so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them — with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself.",
            "Character Story 3\tHaving never studied the art of finance, the astrologist Mona is always hovering around the poverty line.\nIn order to save on food expenses, she once ate mushrooms for an entire month straight. If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.\nMona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.\nSo where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.\nIn fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.\nThat Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.\nIn order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellations in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.\nNow having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?\nWhenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.\nThis process plays out every month.\nToday, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora.",
            "Character Story 4\tMona will sometimes meet up with Klee and Albedo, her primary reason being to get a free meal.\nSecondary to that is to exchange pointers with Albedo.\nSince they are both people who seek to unveil the principles of the world, and both are accomplished students of famed masters, aligning themselves with one another and working together is perfectly normal.\nMona staunchly defends her teacher's image in front of Albedo.\nHowever, she also often complains about \"that old hag.\"\n\"You speak of your illustrious lineage, yet you also refer to your master as a 'hag' and a 'stubborn dimwit.' Which of these descriptions is accurate?\"\nAlbedo could not help but ask this question — and when he did, Mona promptly realized that she had never given it much thought herself.\nStroking her chin, she pondered this paradox deeply for a moment, before responding:\n\"Hmph. The techniques passed down to me are exceptional, of course, but my teacher is not my equal.\nDoes she know the market rates for eggs, butter, or wheat? In this regard, I have already far surpassed her.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tDuring her apprenticeship, Mona found that the subtle abstractions of her master's teachings could explain the laws that governed the existence of all things.\nHuman hearts were guided by these laws, and if one had great enough powers of calculation, all the mysteries of the world could be understood.\nMona once believed this to be true.\nBut when she had to strike out on her own and live day-to-day, she found herself doubting.\nNot everyone lived wealthy and comfortable lives. Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.\nAnd it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her.\n\"Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs.\"\nThis was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey — the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...\nMona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.\nWhen she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.\nPerhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life.",
            "All Things Astrological\tThe Court of Fontaine's mainline newspaper, The Steambird, has many a featured section that contains all sorts of news and gossip drawn from every corner of the seven nations.\nThe section Mona contributes to is known as \"All Things Astrological,\" and it is a column specifically targeted at hobbyists and professionals. That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.\nWhen the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.\nTheir correspondence left him deeply impressed.\nAs it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.\nWhen Mona released her first column, \"An Introduction to Astrology,\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.\nMost of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.\nThe editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:\n\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus.\"\nAfter getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.\nNow, how best to celebrate... Ah yes. Perhaps she should use her first paycheck to purchase that latest-edition celestial globe she'd had her eye on for a while now...",
            "Vision\tTo Mona, that her Vision was sent to her from the gods doesn't mean a great deal.\nThis is not to say that possessing an external focus for elemental power is not useful.\nHaving power is always a good thing, but when compared to lofty \"truth,\" \"martial prowess\" is such a pathetically small concept.\nThe gods, too, are bound by the rules of this world. Mona seeks the final truth of the world, hidden amidst the sea of stars.\nAs such, she does not have any reverence for her Vision, which the people of this world consider to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power.\nNonetheless, this item that serves no practical use in her hands is something that she treasures greatly.\nIt was gifted to her by her teacher as a teaching aid, and it is the only evidence of their time together as master and pupil.\nShe preserves these distant memories with great care. This exquisitely-made teaching aid thus accompanied her everywhere, like an accessory worn by any other maiden.\nUntil one day, when a Vision of her very own would quietly indwell this old teaching aid..."

But if you're unsure about their temper, it's best to keep your distance.\nOh? How do you judge the temperament of a Koholasaur? Haha, my method is super simple. Just slowly approach them, and you'll know pretty quick... If they don't bite, they're probably pretty chill... If they do try to bite, well... just think of it like a little love nip, I guess.",
            "About Mavuika\tThe Pyro Archon is the most respected figure in all of Natlan. I really admire her, not only because she's the Pyro Archon, but because... she looks super cool when she surfs!\nI've challenged her to a race before, actually... Huh? You wanna know who was faster? In that case, let's race, and I'll tell you once you beat me!",
            "About Kachina\tKachina is incredibly gentle and kind. From everything she says, it's clear she's always thinking about others. She has so many great qualities, but she's constantly overlooked and ridiculed because she doesn't stand up for herself. *sigh* I know she can handle herself, it's just... I worry about her lack of confidence. More often than not, she ends up believing the awful things people say about her. So, I've made it my personal mission to encourage her and share her strengths with all the people around me. I'm sure one day, everyone will see her in a new light!",
            "About Kinich\tAjaw will say more in a day than Kinich in a whole year. It can't be easy having to deal with all of Ajaw's antics, but somehow Kinich always manages to do his own thing. Now that I think about it, the only time they seem equally uninterested is when I talk about horoscopes...",
            "About Chasca\tI met Chasca when I was little. We even fought over toys a few times... I was pretty surprised when I heard she became a Peacekeeper. They say some people mature really slowly, while others grow up in an instant. Sometimes, I wonder if I've even started...",
            "About Citlali\tGranny Citlali is without a doubt the most experienced priestess I've ever seen. She's more than just an elder, she's like the coolest elder ever! Her predictions are always super accurate. A long time ago, she said the lucky colors for my business were pink and blue. Sure enough, pink and blue floaters are now my top sellers!\nWhile I was bugging her... uh, I mean, visiting her recently, she mentioned there was an outlander who could bring me good fortune... Ah, wait a sec! Aren't you an outlander!?",
            "About Iansan\tIansan is the pride of the Collective of Plenty and all of Natlan. She's been a part of so many Pilgrimages, and is still unbeaten to this day! I registered for her training class, actually, paid the tuition fee and everything. I just haven't started because, uh... I've been too busy to train...\nOkay, fine. I'll admit... When I saw what Kachina looked like when she finished her training, I heard a voice inside me say, \"Hey, you belong in the water. Stay on dry land for too long, and you'll wind up stranded there.\" Sometimes, you've just gotta listen to your heart!",
            "About Xilonen\tIf the Pyro Archon acknowledges a craftsperson, then you know she's good. Even if an Ancient Name got all smashed up, I bet she could make it good as new again. Wait, did I just jinx something? An Ancient Name absolutely cannot get smashed. That would be so bad. I take it back! I take it back! I didn't say anything. And you didn't hear anything either, alright?",
            "About Ifa\tIfa is the best! No matter what we invite him to do, he's always happy to join. And he's super quick and efficient at everything, too. If he wasn't already working as a vet, I think he'd make a pretty great water sports coach. Hmm? Is he from a different tribe? Well, yeah, but that won't be a problem at all!",
            "More About Mualani: I\tHey, got a moment? Wanna come over and chat? We could go to the hot springs, or anywhere, really. I'm not picky. I don't get opportunities like this very often, so I've brought my Kamera with me. I'll even show you some cool poses and tricks. Trust me, we'll definitely get some cool group photos today!",
            "More About Mualani: II\tBeing a good guide means relying on experience. Our ancestors left behind many practices to learn from. But don't worry, I'm not the type to blindly follow old advice and customs. I only swear by the ones I've tried and found to be useful.\nHuh? Which ones were a bust? Hmm... Well, one time I was out exploring, and I could see a river with a bridge up ahead. But the map wanted me to cross the river with a boat. I measured the river's current and then checked the bridge for any traps or hidden dangers... But, in the end, it turned out that our ancestors didn't recommend using the bridge because... it hadn't been built yet! \nSo, yeah. Experience is key...",
            "More About Mualani: III\tI love guiding visitors from other places! At the end of our tours, they always thank me for introducing them to Natlan's local customs. But honestly, I'm equally grateful to them for sharing their experiences with me, chatting about their hometown, and telling me stories I've never heard before... So, in a way, every trip turns into my own kind of journey, as well!",
            "More About Mualani: IV\tI try my best to play it cool when making new friends, but... hehe... Sometimes people pull me aside and tell me I'm too enthusiastic, to the point of being a little overwhelming. So, now, I try to tone it down a bit at the beginning, and let them warm up to me first...\nOh, and please tell me if I'm ever too much, okay? Don't worry about hurting my feelings. You could even write me an anonymous note, if you want. I promise I'll make it right!",
            "More About Mualani: V\tChallenges have a way of revealing a person's true potential. Participating in the Pilgrimage really made me understand that! But, in a tough situation, I still think two people are better than one. Every person counts... By working together, we can make our own miracles!\nTake the Night Warden Wars, for example... We're not the only ones in this fight. What about the heroes who defended Natlan in ages past, or the younger generations who will fight for us in the future. Our combined efforts are what push Natlan forward. If you ask me, that's the real meaning of \"Umoja.\"",
            "Mualani's Hobbies\tSwimming, diving, water skiing, surfing, parasailing, beach volleyball, water volleyball, rowing, snorkeling, holding my breath underwater... Whew, I don't think I could ever list all my favorite activities, not even if I had an extra pair of hands. Sometimes, when I get tired, I just float on the water and relax... I've even fallen asleep a few times. It may be comfortable, but you pay the price when you wake up and realize you've drifted into the middle of nowhere. I always get an earful from the elders when that happens...",
            "Mualani's Troubles\tWhenever I'm feeling down, I tell myself, \"C'mon, it's okay. It's just bad luck. Having one terrible day doesn't mean things will stay that way.\" That usually helps me feel a little better. But if that still doesn't help, I go Spiritway surfing and shout my lungs out on the high-speed twists and turns. Going for a few rides always makes me feel like I've well and truly left my troubles in the dust.",
            "Favorite Food\tI like a big tray of seafood, no turf, all surf! And no veggies either! One bite makes me feel like a little fish swimming around the sea... Ah, so satisfying!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI regret secretly pouring my glass of milk into the hot springs as a kid. If I actually drank it, maybe I wouldn't be quite so short... But, it's whatever. I promised Auntie Atea I'd never do that again! I drink all my milk now, so it shouldn't be too late to grow a little taller! The same goes for you — we can all learn from my childhood mistakes!",

            "Character Details\tIf any traveler visiting the People of the Springs for the first time wants to try out the popular watersports here, like swimming, surfing, diving, or water polo... Everyone will recommend they go speak with Mualani, without exception.\nMualani operates the Leisurely Puffer, a store that specializes in products related to watersports. Her goods are expertly designed and of superb quality, while she herself has a vast wealth of knowledge in her capacity as a guide. Not only does she enthusiastically pick out colors and styles that'll \"bring good luck\" to her customers, but she'll also recommend the most appropriate hot springs, or the coziest seaside bathing spot and cleanest beaches — guaranteeing that her customers can enjoy a truly delightful and relaxing sightseeing trip.\nAs for those adventurers who are passionate about outdoor exploration and hunting down treasures in domains, they invite Mualani to personally lead the way... as long as they're willing to part with a bit of extra Mora. As a leading guide of the new generation, she has extensive knowledge of the wilderness and abundant experience. Whether her clients wish to just safely and reliably reach their destination, or enjoy a journey full of joy and surprises, Mualani will never disappoint.\n\"The most important thing on a journey is to have a good time on the way! The second most important is to pick a lucky time to set off!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tThere's a certain young lady who tends to leave a deep impression on anyone who's spent any length of time among the People of the Springs, be they resident or tourist.\nFor example, let's say you're enjoying a peaceful sunbathing session by the sea, and you suddenly hear a \"Woohoooooo~~!\" in the distance that quickly gets closer as a young lady on a surfboard rides a wave all the way to the shore at high speeds, leaping onto the beach and kicking up a curtain of sand.\nOr maybe you're watching a beach volleyball match, and a certain lithe young lady shouts encouragement to her teammates before springing straight up the next second, spiking the ball back towards the other side, your shout of excitement resonating with the waves.\nAnd then there was that one time you were invited to join a gathering, and a bunch of guests meeting for the first time were talking quietly, and people still seemed kinda tense. Just then, she showed up, like a superstar taking the stage, and announced at the top of her lungs:\n\"C'mon, why's it so quiet? Music's playing, that means it's time to boogie!\"\nAnd with that, she leaped to the center of the dance floor, swaying her body in time to the music, while those around her, infected by her enthusiasm, joined in one after another...\nYou attempted to ask around about who she was, and you instantly got a name without even having to try: Mualani.\nAnd later, when you went to buy some watersports equipment, there in the shop, you saw that beaming face once more.\nAt first, you were only planning on buying a surfboard, but you ended up learning all about the different locations of the various hot springs of the People of the Springs and how the experiences they offer differ, important tips and tricks for surfing, as well as where to find her little Koholasaurus friends. Of course, she also recommended that you buy a blue board, since it'll bring you good luck.\n\"Actually, I've seen you before...\" You attempt to bring up all the times you met before.\n\"Oh wow, I didn't realize you were an old friend! In that case, I'll give you 40% off this time, and be sure to come find me if you want some surfing lessons!\"\nYou originally intended to just kick back and relax for a few days, but ended up staying for several months. Over time, you two did in fact end up becoming good friends. One day, your curiosity gets the better of you and you finally ask her why she is so enthusiastic towards every single one of her friends, and even some strangers.\n\"Yeah, I'd say... There are two kinds of people in the world. Friends you already know, and friends you haven't met yet.\"\nMualani thinks about it for a moment, then gives you a big smile.",
            "Character Story 2\tMualani's parents are both quite successful merchants. Not only have they established a trade network that spanned Natlan, but they have even established partnerships with foreign merchants.\nWhen she was little, her parents were always busy cultivating relationships with their business contacts, and sometimes, they'd be running around outside the home for weeks at a time. So, Mualani would often roam around town with their puppy, or spend her time with the other kids in the tribe, trying their hand at all kinds of watersports.\nIt was only on holidays that the family would always decorate their house and make a big meal to celebrate.\nDuring one such family dinner, Mualani asked if she could help lighten their load and shoulder a bit of their work. That way, they should have more quality time together as a family.\n\"Lots of adults say I've got an ideal personality for doing business!\" said she.\nHer mother thought Mualani ought to try doing many different things, experience different places, and then decide what she really wanted to do.\nHer father added that it wouldn't be too late for her to join the family business if she still wanted to be a merchant afterward, but that they would support her completely should anything else capture her interest.\nIn the end, Mualani did travel all over, flitting freely over every peak and valley of Natlan like a bird. Many of those faraway vistas were truly enchanting, but as a seabird whose home was by the coast, she often missed the salty smell of the seabreeze.\nAnd so she returned home and engaged in all kinds of watersports, researching the equipment used in them. She wasn't satisfied with the completed products available, so she began learning how to manually modify their functionality herself. She would also apply some lucky colors and some patterns, giving the products a dash more personality.\nShe became the trendsetter, and every time she changed her gear, everyone else would fall all over themselves to get identical items. Mualani was more than happy to indulge their requests, and over time, she became an \"equipment seller\" and earned a tidy sum.\nEver since the Leisurely Puffer opened, it has also become more of a gathering place for watersports enthusiasts. Naturally, some among them are more into the sports aspect, and others are more focused on the equipment.\nRegardless, Mualani gradually experienced the joy of operating a business — the smiles on the faces of people when they receive something they love shine brighter than glittering gold.\nWhat is this really what Mualani wants to do the most? If you ask her that question, she'll definitely scratch her head:\n\"Hey, life's a journey, you know, and you can keep on enjoying all kinds of scenery as long as it lasts! There's no rush to decide on a destination, especially when there's such a long way to go! That's what makes it so fun!\"",
            "Character Story 3\tMualani used to never plan ahead when traveling. Whenever she arrived someplace, she'd wander around, chatting with locals and asking about fun things to do nearby, good places to eat, or any unique local customs, and then decide on the spot what to do that day.\nIf she really hit it off with someone, she'd happily invite them along. This usually developed into a lively party, or a fun excursion nearby.\nAs long as Mualani isn't running too short on time, she'll soon know \"the sights and places only the locals know\" like the back of her hand.\nSometimes, other tourists and sightseers will ask her for directions, and as soon as she starts expounding on her knowledge of the area, it's hard to blame them for assuming she's a guide and offering her money to show them around.\nMualani would repeatedly wave her hands: \"A guide must ensure the safety of travelers, and that's way out of my league! Besides, I only just got here myself!\"\nFriends visiting the People of the Springs from afar was when Mualani really got to show her skills.\nSome of her friends said she was a born guide, and others urged her:\n\"Once you're a guide, take us to dragon ruins nobody else has even been to for a look! Maybe we'll find some valuable swag!\"\nMualani thought it all sounded very doable, so the next day, she went and found the famous guide, Nuu, and asked to be his student.\nShe asked him, just what skills does a guide that wants to take people exploring need to master?\nNuu thought for a second: \"First is wilderness survival, such as the behaviors of wild animals, the uses of and how to cook common plants, and how to pick a good campsite. Next is knowing the land itself, such as how to judge the direction of the tides and the length of time between eruptions. You must also have actually traveled across the landscape, traversing the canyons, caves, and volcanoes. Yes, spend about three years doing that, and you'll be ready to start learning.\"\nMualani was about to just turn and leave, but suddenly thought better of it. She did want to see many places she ordinarily wouldn't, and so she paid a huge sum as her tuition fee.\nThough Nuu emphasized that reaching your destination safely was the most important thing, Mualani could never resist seeing where the other fork in the road led. After all, what if there was some amazing treasure waiting to be found? And so, all kinds of accidents inevitably happened, like accidentally charging into Koholasaurus nests or falling into pits concealed by grasses.\nBut Mualani didn't fuss about such situations. To her, taking the wrong road helped her remember the right path, not to mention that sometimes, her misadventures led to windfalls — for example, finding an ore unknown to anyone in their time buried at the bottom of the pit.\nLater, when she officially became a guide, she remembered her teacher's words, and planned the safest, most reliable routes for travelers. Still, a journey without happy accidents was kind of like an Apple Roly Poly without Apple, and that was completely unacceptable to Mualani.\nOnce, she was taking some tourists to a plateau that commanded an expansive view. She suggested a group photo, and just as they had all gotten into their poses and chosen their expressions, just as Mualani was lifting up the Kamera, a volcano in the distance suddenly erupted.\nMualani pressed the shutter in that very instant, and clapped and laughed at the resulting photo. \"A perfect shot! Go me! Guess I planned out the best spot for the picture, huh?\"\nJust then, a massive rumbling caused the tourists to look at each other apprehensively. Mualani reassured them:\n\"Relax, it's totally safe at this distance! Next up, there'll be a few smaller eruptions. You'll never see anything else like it, so have a seat and enjoy the show!\"\nThat's the kind of reliable guide Mualani is, helping you reach your destination safely even amidst heart-stopping excitement.\nShame, though, that even to this day, she's never found a Saurian relic that can fetch a decent price.",
            "Character Story 4\t\"C'mon, pleeeeease, you've gotta tell me my fortune for this trip!\" Mualani's whole body was slumped against the door as she shouted. \"I'll paaaay!\"\n\"Go find someone else!\" Citlali — the high priestess of the Masters of the Night-Wind, who had left the tribe to live alone, was inside her home on the other side of the door, also pressed against it — \"You're just taking some people out for a stroll, just what the heck kinda danger do you think there is? Don't overthink it, girl!\"\nSeparated only by Citlali's door, their epic struggle unfolded. It was only when Citlali finally threatened Mualani with having to pay her back the full retail price for the door if it broke that peace finally reigned once more.\nYet there was no way Mualani would be discouraged so easily, so she brought a basket brimming with food on her next visit.\nFried shrimp beanballs, blazed meat stew, Saurus crackers... Though Citlali by no means wished to entertain guests — well, she mostly just didn't want to bother tidying up her place — but for the sake of the food, she let her in.\nAfter Citlali had eaten and drunk to her heart's content, Mualani sought to strike while the iron was hot and take advantage of Citlali's good mood, unleashing her finishing move:\n\"Say, Granny, you know that a new volume of 'Mirage Warriors' is coming out soon, don't you?\"\nCitlali was unfazed. \"As a loyal reader who has reached the level of a walking encyclopedia, of course I know.\"\n\"You know, my next clients are visiting Natlan for inspiration, some editors and authors from the Yae Publishing House... Oh my, maybe I could even get an advance copy!\"\n\"Ahem! The lands of Natlan are suffused with mystery and the unknown. We must all revere the night and fire. I shall make an exception and divine your fortune this time.\"\n...\n\"Should you encounter a fork in the road, you must take the right-hand path.\" Such was the revelation that the Night-Wind that blew upon the future brought to Citlali in her meditations. \"It's a good thing you came to me, girl. Were you not forewarned, the consequences would have been unthinkable.\"\nBefore setting out, Mualani double-checked the map. There should be but one way to the destination. But when Mualani's party reached the volcano's innards, a crossroads unmarked on the map appeared before them. Apparently, the active volcano had already altered the terrain in the area.\nFollowing Citlali's advice, she was able to lead the entire group to the original destination without incident, as expected.\nFrom then on, Mualani respectfully referred to Citlali as the \"coolest elder,\" and often brought her all kinds of presents as she sought \"life advice.\" It was from that time that the frequency of Mualani's mentions of \"good luck\" and \"bad luck\" began to steadily tick upwards.\nEven to this day, the two wage war from opposite sides of Citlali's door. Should Citlali slip up and find herself on the back foot, then Mualani will once more barge into her home through the crack in the door.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe war between Natlan and the Abyss has lasted for centuries. Like most other natives of Natlan, Mualani grew up on a diet of the stories of those legendary heroes. But the life she actually saw was nothing like that chronicled in the woven scrolls, filled with danger and excitement.\nThe People of the Springs that Mualani remembered had a really laid-back atmosphere, and they lived leisurely lives, never too hurried. When the big kahunas agreed to discuss some important matter or another, they'd usually take a nice comfy soak in the hot springs first, then enjoy some snacks along with milk before finally slowly getting around to the actual business.\nEven the music popular amongst the tribe tended to be really laid-back and mellow.\nHearing those stories of distant battlefields as a child, the puzzled Mualani once posed this question to an elder tasked to serve as a guardian:\n\"Is the Abyss a dangerous enemy? But then, why doesn't anybody seem nervous at all?\"\nThe elder guffawed, and she patted Mualani's head. \"It's not all that scary. Once you're all grown up, you'll be able to defeat it too.\"\nMualani was still a bit confused, but it wasn't a very pressing concern, so she tossed it to the back of her mind for the time being and kept on growing up, without a care in the world.\nUntil one night, when the Abyss suddenly attacked her tribe. Mualani witnessed with her own eyes how the guardians strove against the monsters, and finally understood that the carefree life she had always enjoyed was not to be taken for granted.\nFollowing the elders of the tribe, she slowly learned the ways of battle. Her long experience with watersports ensured that she had phenomenal physical capabilities, and she was like a charging shark in battle.\nLater, she organized a team to participate in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, but as the squad was mostly composed of newcomers, they quickly wiped out in the team round.\nHer teammates were pretty dejected, but Mualani was as cheerful as ever: \"We managed to go a few rounds with the pros! That's already pretty awesome! Plus, we got a lot of experience, so we'll do even better next time!\"\nAnd just like she said, they steadily improved each time they participated, until finally, they earned their laurels and the right to participate in the Night Warden Wars.\nThen, her impression of the Abyssal enemy was still that of her memories of the night from all those years ago: Huge, powerful, unstoppable. Yet when she and her companions came face-to-face with their foes, she unexpectedly found that she could take them down, one after another.\n\"Looks like today's my lucky day, I didn't run into anything too tough.\"\nThis \"good luck\" never left her, and she participated in three Night Warden Wars and was victorious in all three, never even needing to be resurrected.\nEach time she returned triumphant, the tribe would hold a huge hot springs party. Children who had heard tell of her experiences would run over and beg her to teach them her fighting techniques.\n\"I wanna be an awesome warrior like you, too!\"\nLooking at their innocent faces, Mualani was reminded of her own childhood, and how she too and asked her elders questions. She smiled and waved her hands.\n\"The Abyss isn't that scary, you know! You should be having fun now — save the fighting stuff for when you're all grown up!\"\n\"Oh, right! Let me teach you how to surf next time!\"",
            "\"Sharky Surfboard\"\tOnce, when Mualani was surfing, she encountered a freshwater shark. Though initially far away, it approached her rapidly and soundlessly, before suddenly breaching the surface, its razor-sharp teeth reflecting the sunlight with a cold gleam.\n\"Haha, are you here to surf too?\" Mualani nimbly cut back, swiftly switching directions and dodging its attack. She sped up, putting some distance between them: \"In that case, let's race!\"\nAccepting her challenge, the freshwater shark pursued her relentlessly as Mualani sped on ahead with everything she had, the spray laying a long white raceway for them.\nAs they approached the coastline, the freshwater shark turned back in a fury, its hunt a failure. Mualani, not far away, waved back at it: \"Let's play again next time!\"\nLater, she would encounter this same challenger in those same waters. Mualani dubbed it \"Sharky,\" and the two of them raced over and over. In the first few rounds, Mualani was faster, but the shark was not to be outdone, and slowly closed the gap, until finally, it caught her. But that time, it didn't chomp her, but instead elegantly shook its chubby body, announcing itself the victor.\n\"You won this one! Okay, here's your promised reward.\" Mualani fed it the dried fish she'd brought, and rubbed its fins.\nThey became true surfing buddies. Until one day, after they finished playing, Sharky circled her a few times, and then waved its caudal fin, swimming off in the direction of the setting sun.\nMualani waved as she usually did, but when she next went to her old spot to surf, she didn't see that speedy round shape as she normally did.\nMualani knew that any encounter is but a part of the journey, and that everyone eventually finds their new destination. Still, that doesn't mean the happiness that was shared must disappear.\nSo thinking, Mualani took out a piece of paper, and began to draw. Two weeks later, she handed the design for the \"Sharky Surfboard\" to an artisan she was familiar with. Sharky's fins were hard, but its tail was flexible. To achieve this, she chose her materials carefully, also recreating the texture of Sharky's skin, and even reproducing how its teeth meshed together.\nAs for the color scheme, it naturally had to be eye-catching so that everyone who saw Sharky would remember what it looked like!\nAnd so, with her new gear in tow, Mualani was the center of attention once more. Amidst the ardent cries, the \"Sharky Surfboard\" was eventually mass-produced and sold to the public — though naturally, that version can't bite.\nWhen Mualani surfs, she occasionally wonders when the next time she'll get to race Sharky is. After all, Mualani really wants to know just who is faster: Sharky Surfboard, or Sharky.",
            "Vision\tMualani would later profoundly understand what the Ancient Name \"Umoja\" signified, yet her personal perception of it actually began on what was — at first — a perfectly peaceful night many years before.\nThat night, it was already midnight as she and her friends' boisterous hot springs party was winding down. Everyone was still soaking in the joyous afterglow when a loud sound in the distance shattered the quiet. It was wholly out of place, and made all the more clear by the night's prior tranquility.\nEveryone was staring at each other uneasily, unsure of what had happened. Just then, Atea, who had been patrolling, hurried over: \"All of you, run for safety! It's an Abyss attack!\"\nThe scene immediately exploded into chaos, as everyone prepared to flee, yet Mualani raised her hand high: \"Atea! I'd like to stay and help!\"\nAfter Mualani stepped up, the others too slowly began to step forward, hoping to contribute what they could.\n\"Nope, none of you have any combat experience. It's too dangerous for you to stay here. Battle is no joking matter.\"\nBut Mualani's determination was no joke either. As a member of the tribe, she didn't think she should stay out of it.\n\"There should be ways we can help other than fighting.\"\nAs Mualani said this, she looked back at those familiar friends who had also chosen to stay—\nIrapa's feet had wings, and he was a supremely fast runner. He could go alert nearby residents. Ollanta had a powerful physique, and good eyesight, and was perfect for helping patrol, while Yana had once been a lifeguard, and knew first-aid techniques, so she could act in a supporting role...\n\"And as for me,\" Mualani stepped onto her surfboard, her pride and joy, \"My speed is second to none. I'll go wherever I'm needed!\"\nHer companions agreed, and Atea had better things to do than try and stop them, so she directed them to take care of each other and put safety first.\n\"In that case, Mualani, come with me to find the Abyssal Pylons.\"\n...\nMualani followed the Spiritways, scouting the area around the tribe and confirming the Abyssal Pylon locations. Every time she found one, she'd relay the information to the guardians as they fought.\nThere was one Pylon that was disgorging an inordinate number of monsters, and the warriors were pitted in a bitter struggle against them. By the time Mualani finally was able to find reinforcements, the battlefield was already scorched and blackened.\nAtea's blade flashed, its keen edge cleaving deep into a monster's body, just as yet another monster behind her was bracing itself to strike.\n\"Watch out!\" Mualani shouted at the top of her lungs as she accelerated towards the monster, colliding with it in mid-leap and bowling it over — but in the process, she herself became utterly exposed.\nHaving been so challenged, the monster turned and raised its keen claws towards Mualani. She shrank back and tensed, but the attack never came. Warm blood splashed her face, as Atea's sharp steel pierced its heart clean through.\n...\nThe grueling battle lasted until daybreak. When they finally confirmed that all the Abyssal Pylons had been sealed, Mualani followed behind Atea and the guardians, returning exhausted to the tribe.\nMualani noticed that everyone was injured to a greater or lesser extent. Some had already done emergency first-aid, wrapping the wounds in bandages. By comparison, having been protected by everyone else, she only had a few shallow scrapes.\nA new feeling welled up in her heart, regret mixed with a feeling of defiance, a resolve not to merely accept this result. \"If only I were faster, then I'd have been of more help.\"\nShe clenched her fists, and privately made up her mind. She would seek out the warriors of the tribe to learn how to fight.\nIt was only after Atea brought Mualani back home that her anxious parents, who had been worrying all night, learned she had returned from the battlefield.\n\"She really is a very brave kid.\" Before she left, Atea patted her cheek.\n...\nThat day, Mualani dreamed for a very long time. Had her face not lain on something very hard when she rolled over, she might've slept yet longer.\nOpening her eyes, she felt that hard object in her hand — a crystal-clear Vision.\nFollowing the rays of sunlight streaming in through the window, she caressed it in her palm, inspecting it carefully over and over to make sure it wasn't some toy her parents had bought for her.\n\"Is this the spoils for winning my first fight? Now that's what I'd call lucky!\""

            "Hello\tNice to meet you! Hehe, I've actually been watching you for a long time already. My name's Nahida. I might look like a child, but don't be fooled: I understand this world much better than any grown-up. So... can we trade knowledge? I want to hear all about your travel stories. So, what would you like to know in return?",
            "Chat: Invitation\tIf you're not sure what to do next, how about I take you on a walk?",
            "Chat: Concerns\tSomething on your mind again? Let's work through it together. Two heads are better than one.",
            "Chat: Feelings\tWhat they say is true: You have to see the world for yourself to appreciate how beautiful it is.",
            "When It Rains\tQuick, let's find shelter, or mushrooms will start growing on our heads.",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tDid you know that the sound of thunder is the prelude to new life? *sigh* Soon, this land will be brimming with vitality.",
            "When It Snows\tCan you hear that? The heavens are whispering to all living things, \"It's time for bed now.\"",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tAh, the weather is lovely and warm. Things are about to start getting lively again.",
            "When It's Windy\tThe wind never blows in the Sanctuary of Surasthana... Oh, sorry. That's probably obvious to you.",
            "Good Morning\tGood morning. We should get going right away. There are too many things in this world that you'll miss if you don't get there on time.",
            "Good Afternoon\tAh, time for a break. I'd really like a Berry & Mint Burst... If you get one for me, I'll tell you a couple of stories about the sun. Okay?",
            "Good Evening\tThe sun's setting. It's time to wave goodbye and let the creatures of the night take center stage.",
            "Good Night\tYou should go to sleep now. Don't worry, I've made sure there's a sweet dream waiting for you.",
            "About Nahida: Knowledge\tOh, the Mare Jivari? A place without anything at all, completely empty — just like a Shroomboar's brain. Of course I know it. ...Hmm? I, uh... It's true, I've never seen it with my own eyes. It's one of the many places beyond my reach.",
            "About Nahida: Obsession\tThe gods gave humans barely enough knowledge for them to fill their stomachs. Yet, they used it to craft tools, write books, and build cities, and now they've set their sights on the stars and the abyss... With every moment that goes by, they're creating brand-new knowledge, so I never want to take my eyes off them.",
            "About Us: Story Time\tThe things you've experienced on your journey are so much more exciting than anything I've ever learned. And now, I get to ask you about all of it any time I want, so I can understand each and every little detail... I couldn't ask for more. Alright, let's not waste any more time. Now where were we...?",
            "About Us: Journey\tBeing a listener has never been enough for me. I've always dreamed of going out and seeing things for myself. You're such an experienced adventurer... Can you be my guide? I want to experience all your future tales first-hand.",
            "About the Vision\tThe heavens grew eyes to behold the true beauty of the world below, but humans already have eyes to begin with. So, what is it they see when they look at the world not with their eyes, but their vision? You're very smart. Can you figure out what the answer is?",
            "Something to Share\tVery often, only once we get hurt badly are we finally forced to face our own laziness, ignorance, recklessness, or arrogance. There's nothing to regret, though. We have no way of seeing all the possibilities that lie ahead in the future, so we have to rely on clumsy trial-and-error to gain knowledge. Just think of pain as the tuition you have to pay.",
            "Interesting Things: A Flower Yet to Blossom\tSumeru's desert looks more desolate than the rainforest, but it's also home to an ancient civilization, and supports its own stable ecosystem. One day, when it finally stops arguing with the rainforest, I'm sure that flowers will blossom there, the likes of which I've never seen before.",
            "About Cyno: Jokes\tHis jokes are like buried treasure: gems hidden beneath the surface. They're a lot of fun. Hmm? Well, which part didn't you get? Okay, I can explain it for you.",
            "About Cyno: Duty\tNot every General Mahamatra would take such a clear-cut and decisive stance when faced with a conflict between order and justice. He must know only too well that compromise is a path that leads to a dead end, so it's extremely fortunate for all of Sumeru that he's now been able to return to his rightful post.",
            "About Tighnari\tThe Forest Watchers played an essential role in helping the rainforest to withstand the Withering and continue to flourish, and Tighnari is the best of them all. Still... I do hope he learns to be a little gentler with people. Otherwise, it's gonna be difficult for the Forest Rangers to attract new top talent.",
            "About Collei\tWhen I heard her story for the first time, her tenacity shone through like a dazzling gemstone. She's been through so much... I hope that just as the rainforest supports all kinds of life, Sumeru will always provide a safe and nurturing environment for her, so that she can grow up healthy and strong.",
            "About Alhaitham\tHe holds a body of knowledge more advanced than most could imagine, and his mind is constantly thinking, so maybe nothing in this world could ever fool him. But is the wise man truly wise to view the mediocre majority as defective? Because without them, there is no us.",
            "About Nilou\tI once borrowed someone else's body to ask her if she'd mind allowing Lesser Lord Kusanali to watch her dance... Actually, I had already watched her lots of times before in secret, but I wanted to attend her dance at the Sabzeruz Festival properly, in person, as a sign of respect. Anyway, it turned out that she gently declined the offer... I was a little sad about that.",
            "About Dori\tThe first thing she said when she saw me was \"Nice palace. How much?\" Of course, I couldn't possibly sell her the Sanctuary of Surasthana. But still, her question had me stumped. I thought about it long and hard, but I still can't figure out how much Mora it's worth...",
            "About Kaveh\tHe has an almost-perfect grasp of what it truly means for Sumeru to be a Nation of Wisdom. Sadly, the truth as he understands it will never be accepted as the mainstream. Hmm? He's roommates with Alhaitham? Wow... the world really is full of surprises...",
            "About Faruzan\tShe is suffering from exposure to remnants of King Deshret's power. It's as if the great tortoise of time accidentally threw her off its back and left her suspended in the past. If you're interested, you should be able to catch a glimpse of Sumeru from a bygone age through her.",
            "About The Seven: Introduction\tI'm led to believe that long, long ago, the Seven Archons used to stay in regular contact with each other. I'm a bit of a special case though, so I don't have any memory of that time... Now that things have settled down in Sumeru, I think it's about time I made contact with them again. You're on familiar terms with some of them, right? Would you mind introducing me?",
            "About The Seven: Games\tI hear that playing games is a good way to quickly bring people closer together. I'm sure it must work for gods, too. How about once everyone meets up, I suggest we play hopscotch together? ...Hmm, on second thought, maybe not. If I draw the squares, it would look like I made them really small on purpose just so I could win. That wouldn't be fair on the others.",
            "About The Balladeer\tWhen he finally achieved the ambition he thought he'd been pursuing all along, was he content at last, or only emptier still? We only yearn for the skies because we cannot fly... Hmm, perhaps he should reflect on this once he has held the sheer emptiness of the skies in his grasp.",
            "About Furina\tPeople often say that wisdom isn't about what you know, but knowing what you can change. It is beyond question that the \"prophecy\" was carved into Irminsul long ago... and while it may look like nothing has changed, it also seems like everything has. I think we both know her to be smart enough to turn the fate of the world around.",
            "More About Nahida: I\tMy past is quite monotonous. I could tell you about it, but it wouldn't be long before you let out a great, big yawn, like a Pufferfish taking in a big gulp of water. But curiosity is worth its weight in gold, and I wouldn't want yours to go to waste... I know — let me tell you about all the dreams I've had.",
            "More About Nahida: II\tIn my dreams, there's often a flower pot. Every time I water it and add fresh fertilizer, the same flower grows. Can you still enjoy the process of growing flowers when you already know the exact outcome in advance? Hehe, well, for me, I'm glad that at least after the flower has blossomed, it attracts different colored butterflies each time, and sometimes even bees.",
            "More About Nahida: III\tIn my dreams, there's often an hourglass. I like to add a few drops of water. Then, I shake it up, and time how long it takes to settle, and see if there's any difference from the last time. There's no reasoning behind it and nothing to gain out of it, but somehow it seems to relieve the exhaustion in my brain. I think that the fact that it's for nothing is what makes it fun for me.",
            "More About Nahida: IV\tIn my dreams, there's often an empty space. No matter how the scenery changes around it, the emptiness always occupies the most important place. Strange, isn't it? I think there used to be something there, but for all the power I have over dreams, I still can't find the answer as to what it was. Ugh, seems like even in my dreams, there are things that I can't control...",
            "More About Nahida: V\tIn my dreams, there can be anything — anything except people coming and going. But since meeting you, it's gradually started to get more lively here... Maybe you're a guide, adding a human touch to my dreams and leading me out from my cage. Hehe, c'mon, let's go. The journey's only just beginning, and I'd like you to carry on leading the way.",
            "Nahida's Hobbies\tUmm... does watching you count as a hobby? Because everything you do fascinates me. You're traveling the whole world... Where did you come from, and where will you go next? Who will you meet, and what challenges will you have to overcome? I want to know the answers to all these questions and more. So please don't mind me, I just wanna keep on watching you, all the time.",
            "Nahida's Troubles\tI think I'm good at asking the right questions and giving good answers, but I've come to realize that a lot of people just convince themselves they don't understand. The answers to their problems don't help them. It seems to me that as people grow older, they lose the courage to question things and accept the truth...",
            "Favorite Food\tDefinitely Candied Ajilenakh Nuts. I just need one little bite and my brain starts chugging away at top speed, and suddenly there's no problem too difficult for me to solve. The only thing you need to watch out for is: Don't put the jar somewhere that's too easy to reach.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tSea creatures are born into infinite darkness and live their lives in the depths of the ocean. It's a complete unknown to me. Eating them is like swallowing an icky storm cloud.",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tMm, may the world never forget this beautiful flavor. Thank you.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tHehe, I really appreciate this. It tastes lovely.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\t...How should I put this? I guess... you wouldn't feed Shroomboars to a Sumpter Beast, would you?",
            "Birthday\tI was thinking, your birthday celebration needs to be at least as grand as the Sabzeruz Festival, so... Hmm? Too much? But everyone's already done preparing for it. C'mon, c'mon, let's go! Just this once — I'll make sure you love it!",

            "Character Details\tGreater Lord Rukkhadevata created Sumeru's rainforest and bestowed wisdom upon the people of Sumeru through the Akademiya. Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.\nOn the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol — one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.\nBut the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.\nFrom the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.\nThe Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.\nThrough the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that \"The God of Wisdom will never come back.\"\nShe knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.\nThus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, Nahida makes no argument against it.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe process of learning and growth is joyful, and knowledge concerning this world always satisfies Nahida's exuberant curiosity.\nGradually, Nahida came to grasp the principles of nature and the elements, understanding the ecology of the sky and the sea. She could even compose what she learned into fascinating dreams that are logical, yet beyond imagination.\nSuch dreams are, in essence, the same as Nahida's marvelous metaphors — they all lead to a dawning understanding of the similarities between two otherwise unrelated things.\nBut there are times when she meditates on things yet struggles to figure them out, and such incidents usually concern events related to people or society.\nFor example, when honesty and truth could exempt a person from punishment, some people might turn silent and deceitful; and when with their beloved ones, some people would hurt others with brutal words.\nIt feels as if the contradictions of the entire world are focused through and manifested by human beings, whose fickle emotions are perplexing to Nahida.\nIn such moments, her metaphors would not work. Nor could she find any system in this world as a reference for such chaos.\nShe could only explain it by the fact that the difference between every person's uniqueness creates diverse reactions when they undergo similar emotions.\nBut this was not a satisfactory answer to Nahida. To better know human beings, plain knowledge and dogma alone would never suffice.\nPerhaps it was from that moment on that Nahida came to understand why \"she\" had to stand firmly by human beings' side and even made tremendous sacrifices for their sake.\nFor each and every one of \"them\" is a unique existence in this world.",
            "Character Story 2\tNahida's life might be uniform, but she owns the most fantastic and lively dream in all of Sumeru.\nThe knowledge she learns through the Akasha during the day is presented vividly in her dreams at night. As she learns more knowledge, her dreams become even more intricate and full of life.\nThe dreams not only relax her mind, but also give her chances to examine her new knowledge to see if it goes against common sense or if she is missing any details.\nWhen Dusk Birds first appeared in Nahida's dream, those birds soared through the sky in a standing posture with their wings folded.\nIt looked abnormal and caught Nahida's attention immediately. Nahida thus learned how wings worked, after which the Dusk Birds could fly freely in her dreams.\nNext, she adopted similar methods to fix Shroomboars that slept underwater, Radishes that grew on apple trees, and crystalflies with mismatched wing colors.\nKnowledge shall not be a mere approach to justify things in this world, it could also be used to satisfy her need for pure innocent fun.\nTechnically, Shroomboars can only walk on the ground. Now that she understood how wings work, wouldn't Shroomboars with wings fly all the same?\nAnd where there are flying Shroomboars, it is only natural to have crocodiles that walk on their hind legs and Harra Fruits who speak human languages...\nThe way Nahida develops her knowledge system has subsequently created a little amusement park for her, free of disturbance. In her dreams, she is in the embrace of boundless happiness.",
            "Character Story 3\tChildren have yet to be well-informed and are easily swayed by emotions, but it does not mean that they can be disrespected or mocked.\nFrustration and disappointments do indeed grant them a taste of reality — but at the cost of robbing them of innocent thoughts and exuberant emotions.\nThe children who unluckily run across such negativity would always hear a gentle, warm voice on some ordinary night.\nShe listens attentively to the children, uses her wonderful metaphors to clarify principles to them, plays with them, and talks about their favorite games and snacks... until dawn.\nThough the night is short, such company would let the children believe that there is still someone in this world who understands them.\nHatred and frustration are thus melted away by the warmth in their hearts, and the children would gain an opportunity to make a change in their lives such that they can grow in confidence and gladness.\nHowever, none of them could recognize to whom the gentle, warm voice belonged. Everyone knows, after all, that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had departed a long time ago.\nA group of children gathered in secret and discussed this mystical phenomenon. Suddenly, a child who seemed to know a lot more than their peers mentioned a somewhat unusual name, \"Lesser Lord Kusanali.\"\nThey soon accepted that theory. And, of course, none of their parents believed them.\nBut what did that matter? Lesser Lord Kusanali was already their friend.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe greenery-planning personnel in Sumeru City once received a mysterious letter. The sender was, apparently, \"An Enthusiastic and Perfectly Leisurely Citizen of Sumeru City.\"\nThe letter contained detailed suggestions and thoughtful planning that took both the weather and practicality into consideration.\nJudging by the professionalism of the letter's contents, it was natural to assume that the letter was from a well-known Amurta researcher who would prefer to stay anonymous.\nDespite the writer's anonymity, the greenery-planning personnel carried out their work in the city exactly as stated in the letter, as if they were implementing orders from their superior.\nThe outcome reaped high praise. Later one day, Nahida borrowed Katheryne's body and took a walk on the streets in the city. To her great joy, she found out that the arrangement of plants was exactly the same as she had expected.\nThe letter was from Nahida, of course. She had written it because she thought that though knowledge is important, practice is also essential.\nBut with the exceedingly strict control the sages exercised, Nahida had to persuade them with great effort before they agreed to let her send this seemingly useless letter anonymously.\nBut so encouraged was Nahida by the great success of her first attempt at putting knowledge into practice that in the following days, even when she walked, she was ever so full of elated confidence.\nBut then she rounded a corner and noticed unexpectedly that several flowers of completely mismatched colors had been planted together.\nAfter careful examination, she found out that it was because she had not considered the possibility that one of the flower species might change colors, nor had she specified the cultivation environment for the flowers very strictly in her plans.\nThen it occurred to her that this bunch of flowers could have been here for dozens of days, during which everyone might have witnessed her \"complete lack of aesthetic sense\"...\nThat day, many claimed that they saw Ms. Katheryne, who usually stood behind the reception desk with a confident smile, crouching next to a pot of flowers, her hands covering her blushing face.",
            "Character Story 5\tHow might one eradicate the threat that forbidden knowledge poses to Irminsul?\nNahida used to believe that she was the one who had the answer, but never did she realize that she was also the answer herself.\nOne who takes action will certainly leave one's traces behind. When one wishes to eradicate oneself, a paradox would thus occur.\nThat is why it is inevitable that one must depend on others to accomplish this goal.\nBy the time Nahida had figured this out, time was running out, leaving her no room for further consideration. The knowledge accumulated through the years could not even help her find a solution to the pressing dilemma before her.\nBut just as ████ said, as one with wisdom, one should feel joy upon the discovery of the answer.\nShe was not born just to accomplish such cruel deeds. Only after eradicating forbidden knowledge could she focus on Sumeru's future and plan for the prosperity and happiness that her nation could call its own.\nWill a nation walking into the future still remember a name that no longer exists? It does not matter.\n\"Does it really not matter?\"\nNahida would have definitely proposed otherwise. Shame, then, that their time was too short. In that blink of an eye, ████ did not even leave her a chance to retort.",
            "Nahida's \"Toy Box\"\tThough it looks no different from a regular box, this container has a variety of experimental replicas within it.\nNahida has a strong interest in popular games of all sorts. Their rules are simple, but they are also fun and profound. Be it puzzles or battle games, the fascination they inspire can be long-lasting.\nGames are simple but not simplistic, exemplifying the wisdom of their designers. Deconstructing and reshaping things also make for valuable opportunities to learn.\nHowever, the Akademiya researchers never supported her novel ideas, nor would they satisfy her wish for more toys. So, she compromised and asked for only wood and some tools.\nFollowing the instructions offered by the Akasha and applying her imagination, she managed to create various toys, such as chessboards, cards, puzzle pieces, and three-dimensional locks...\nThe sense of achievement from finishing making toys brought Nahida brief satisfaction, but she soon found this out:\nShe could not find an opponent for any battle-type games, and as the maker, she knew the solutions to all her puzzle games.\n\"If only there were someone else around to try these out.\"\nSo she has always hoped. But before that suitable person shows up, these toys shall stay in their box for now.",
            "Gnosis\tThe existence of the Akasha is the means, not an end in itself. The moment when the forbidden knowledge was eradicated was the moment when the Akasha had accomplished its mission.\nThe one who had coveted the power of the Gnosis had written the entire drama from the start, and would show themselves as the curtains fell.\nNahida, using the Gnosis of a foreign land as leverage, deprived the cunning foe of his \"segments\" as insurance.\nBut the enemy immediately requested for a bargain as well, offering up critical knowledge of the world's \"truth.\"\nHis knowledge of the values rooted in this land was without peer, and thus had he intended to take advantage of Nahida's curiosity and sense of responsibility from the very beginning. Indeed, the way he saw it, there could be no bargaining chip more suitable than knowledge.\nWith one Gnosis still in her hands, Nahida could not help but hesitate. She barely knew more about the Gnoses than she knew the \"truth\" of the world.\nThe Gnosis, to her, was but a core that gathers a mass of elemental power at her discretion. But if there is nothing more to a Gnosis, why was a god so eager to gather all of them together?\nShaking hands in bargain means an equal compromise for both sides, a far cry from any victory. On the other hand, turning down the bargain indicates a certain type of \"ignorance,\" which, obviously, would more easily invite a loss of control.\nThus did the \"God of Wisdom\" instantly find her answer..."

            "When the Sun Is Out\tQuick, look! Up in the sky! Look at that scorching sun, it's like a blast furnace! You know what this means? It means we have to drop everything, right now, and make a run for the ice cream store! We need to get two of the biggest cones they sell, and then it's an all-out race to see who can finish before it melts!",

            "About Navia: Luck\tPeople who know about my past might think I've suffered a lot of misfortune, but I don't see it like that at all.\nI count myself lucky to have received so much love in life.",
            "About Us: Partners\tSome people call me \"Boss,\" others \"Demoiselle,\" but none of that does anything for me.

            "About Us: Keeping Secrets\tPeople say that a secret shared is a secret no more, but I like to think that true friends keep each other's secrets. ...What? Veiled threat?

            "Something to Share: The Dependable Spina di Rosula\tIf you've spent long enough in the Fleuve Cendre, you might have noticed that there are a lot of other groups in Fontaine besides the Spina di Rosula. Beware of them — they each have their own agenda, and they're not all friendly like us. If you ever find yourself in a tight spot, you can always ask Mr. Tetreaux at the bar for help. Unless you're dealing with someone who isn't in the mood to sit down and have a conversation, in which case... White Glove will sort things out. You can count on him.",

After my father's death, I... well, it caused quite a rift between us for a long time. But even then, I never did like having her constantly walking on eggshells around me... I much prefer how things are now.",
            "About Charlotte\tCharlotte's known for her fast-and-furious reporting, but it's her photography skills that really impress me. She once snapped a quick photo of me, a waist-up shot, and the result was absolutely stunning — it was like looking at an oil painting. She seems to have a knack for writing extraordinary news stories and taking the most eye-catching photos. Guess she was born to be a journalist.",
            "About Chiori\tAh, the fashion designer who brought the coolest Inazuman trends to Fontaine? She's actually been a great help to the Spina behind the scenes. She says my unorthodox ideas always give her a lot of inspiration for her work, and from what I can tell, I think she means it. Still, she drew the line at my request for a ten-meter-tall top hat. *sigh* Missed opportunity, if you ask me... Imagine seeing one of those in front of the shop! It would be a great way to draw in customers.",
            "About Furina\tI was lucky enough to catch her in an opera when I was young. Even though it was a charity show, the tickets were nearly impossible to get! She was performing in character then, but I thought she seemed more in her element then than she ever did as an Archon, giving speeches up in the opera box... Looking back, I guess my intuition was right.",
            "About Neuvillette\tAh, how to describe Monsieur Neuvillette... He's... complex, in some ways — but very straightforward in others. I guess a good analogy would be rocky reefs in the sea: Trying to navigate through obstacles you can't see makes for a bumpy ride, but if you can figure out how they work, you start to spot the signs.",
            "About Wriothesley\tTrying to discuss anything with that guy is an exhausting process. Clorinde says I needn't have any reservations about collaborating with him in the scope of our preexisting agreement, but I still shouldn't trust everything that comes out of his mouth. No wonder my father never tried to get involved with the affairs of the Fortress... I think I'll play it safe and keep things that way.",
            "About The Knave\tShe is a formidable but caring leader, and definitely comes across like a master of the house. But she's still a Fatui Harbinger, and that means she must have a more ruthless side. So don't worry — while I'll always appreciate what she did for Poisson, I'm not about to let my guard down around her completely.",
            "About Lyney and Lynette\tI know magicians can often be all bravado and razzmatazz, but I can tell that Lyney is a sincere guy who cares deeply about his friends and family. He's so mature for his age, it catches me off guard sometimes... Oh, and how could I forget — it was so kind of him to try and cheer up the children in Poisson with an impromptu free magic show during the flood! I'll have to invite him and Lynette over for some macarons at my place when I get the chance. I know Lynette's always conjuring teacups out of thin air, so surely at least she's a fan of a proper tea break?",
            "More about Navia: I\tThe Spina's work is basically... well, a little bit of everything, but the focus is always on solving other people's problems. ...That probably makes it sound worse than it is, though. Sure, I'm making other people's problems my own, but I always get a real boost out of being able to help people.",
            "More about Navia: II\tI've always thought that it's important to appreciate the beauty in the world. The blossoms in the spring, summers by the sea, the smiles on your friends' faces... You shouldn't take those things for granted.",
            "More about Navia: III\tSometimes, I like to go out into the wild, find a quiet place with no one else around, and do some target practice.\nIt's a great way to destress! Wanna try? I can walk you through it step by step. You'd be my first student, but I feel like I'd be a great teacher. I still remember everything that my father and Nanny Bracari ever taught me!",
            "More about Navia: IV\tI won't become the same kind of person as my father was. Some veterans of the Spina think that I'm becoming more and more like him, but I think the trend they're referring to is a superficial one, born out of the simple fact that some problems only have so many solutions. Spina di Rosula has changed a lot since my father's day, and I intend to be the president for the Spina of today.",
            "More about Navia: V\tI also don't think I'm going to turn into my mother, either. People say we have similar personalities, and I can kind of understand her reasons for making the decisions she did back in the day, but even so...\nHuh, I have a sudden urge to take a trip on the Clementine Line. Could you come with me? I don't have a particular goal in mind, but... maybe we could take a walk around the city afterwards?",
            "Navia's Hobbies\tI've loved baking ever since I was a child. Don't you think it's magical? You throw a bunch of random ingredients together in the right amounts, put the mixture in the oven, and then just watch as it slowly balloons up and transforms into a delicious treat...\nHey, do you wanna make gingerbread together sometime? We can make it into a fun little competition — see who can build the biggest, most beautiful gingerbread house!",
            "Navia's Troubles\tUgh, cleaning up after baking a cake is a nightmare. The flour just gets everywhere, and the leftover egg whites and cream go all sticky and gross... I'll, um... I'll just go find a helper!",
            "Favorite Food\tI like trying new things, for the surprise factor. But before you question my sense of taste, let me clarify that just because I can appreciate the novelty in a dish doesn't mean I'm claiming it tastes amazing.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI never enjoy leftovers that have been left too long. It just feels like sacrilege to neglect the poor food when it's fresh, then eat after it's gone stale...",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tThis is some incredible cooking! Next time we head out together, looks like I should carry the ingredients and cookware, and let you be the chef.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tNot bad! Next time, you cook the food and I'll plate it. Then, it'll look as good as it tastes.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tDon't feel discouraged! The world needs people who aren't afraid to innovate.",
            "Birthday\tDo you believe that wishes can come true? You know, like when you toss a coin into a fountain for good luck? As long as you throw enough coins in, one of your wishes is sure to come true, right?\nWell anyway, today's your birthday, so I'm not leaving anything to chance — I've got a whole bag of Mora here dedicated to making your birthday wish come true. Whatever you want, I'll do everything in my power to make it happen!",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tAll I need now is a nice pot of soothing tea with a little milk, and our tea party can finally commence... But seriously, one tea party wouldn't begin to repay you after everything you've done for me. So if there's ever something you need in Fontaine, know that Spina di Rosula will always be happy to help you.",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tFontaine's laws are very strict, but its people are quite free-spirited. Fontainian society contains all manner of social organizations, clubs, or factions, all of which have their own origins, development, goals, and style.\nFor example, the short-lived Hat Jellyfish Association ostensibly promoted the protection of the waters and those living within, but was in truth founded by a band of explosives enthusiasts.\nBy comparison, the Spina di Rosula are a law-abiding, reliable lot, their overly rambunctious young President notwithstanding.\nIn official statements, the Spina proclaims itself to be a citizen-oriented society that involves many walks of life and focuses its efforts on solving difficult issues amongst the common folk, and that it will cooperate with the Fontainian authorities where needed.\nIf you ask Navia, she'd tell you that the Spina serves as a business partner with all sorts of people in it, that will help with any problem, using the velvet glove or the iron fist as appropriate.\nNeither of these descriptions are mistaken, at least in broad strokes, so you may choose the one you prefer — though it is worth noting that those who choose the latter wording will find it easier to make friends with Navia.",
            "Character Story 1\tIn Fontaine, to say that you grew up watching the theater is no different from claiming that you were raised drinking water: Simply so ordinary that it barely bears mentioning.\nSo it was with Navia. So enamored was she with the scenes on stage that as a little girl she would pester her father to buy her tickets so that she could experience each part of the tale alongside the characters.\nThese feelings would take on a different note after she became involved in the affairs of the Spina di Rosula. The staged conflicts seemed fewer than the twists and turns at the negotiating table, and she could see the cosmetic scars imagined by makeup artists permanently carved into the bodies of those dwelling in the Fleuve Cendre.\nGradually, her visits to the opera house became less and less frequent, and she instead spent more and more time on those around her. Tragedy onstage was captivating, of course, but Navia did not wish for such tales of misfortune to befall real people.\nHow might one mediate between separated lovers mired in the battlefields of differing perspectives? How might one in middle age robbed of their ability to work by an accident find a new way to be the breadwinner?\nThe world is filled with problems of this sort, and while they bring little profit when resolved, unlike the core businesses that sustain the Spina, Navia throws herself into solving them.\nAnd if anyone should accuse her of being a busybody, she will counter thusly.\n\"Such presumption, to call such matters trivial,\" she'd say, using lofty language to stymie the other party's reply. \"This is called 'a stitch in time saving nine.' And wouldn't you agree that we're doing the Palais Mermonia a favor by preventing someone from being hauled up onstage at the opera house?\"\nAt such times, Navia will not identify herself as the Demoiselle, President, or any fancy title, but as simply as Navia, an enthusiastically civic-minded citizen.",
            "Character Story 2\tNavia, presently the one helping people out of trouble, used to be the one getting into it as a child.\nPresident Callas, busy as he was, had to rely on Spina di Rosula members to take care of her, which was no mean feat when their charge could disappear in the blink of an eye. After much searching, they would at most find the barest hint of a fancy hat's rim visible on some rooftop... only for them to find naught but the hat itself upon finally climbing up.\nThe hat's owner would at that time already be playing somewhere on Mont Automnequi. Her curiosity was so intense that she could easily enjoy and entertain herself even without any companions. Give her a pond, and she could stare at it the whole day, watching birds flapping about as they bathed in the shallows and otters rising from the bottom to do the backstroke. Just this alone could bring her great joy for quite some time, and she would give gifts in gratitude for those who brought her such happiness — millet for the birds to eat, and shells for the otters to play with.\nSometimes, she would also seek out playmates. The children of Fleuve Cendre owned no toys for the most part, so she would play hide-and-seek with them, dragging her silk skirts with her through the pipes. Win or lose, she would always gain a little extra compared to the other kids. She would emerge from her hiding place brandishing a component or two she found in some nook or cranny, a few lost Mora, or a fifty-percent new portable toolbox, and bask in the admiration of her companions.\nThough she would often run off on her own, most of the adults were exceptionally tolerant of her behavior (her father being the exception). Spina members would help bandage her bruised knees, and the women of the Fleuve Cendre would help mend her torn clothes. Navia would think, Ah, I am loved by so many, and such thoughts would make her happier still.\nAt one point, Navia heard an elderly lady next door say gossipingly thusly with others: \"...That girl only has her father, and he's got no time to accompany her... Poor girl, always having to roam outside by herself...\"\nSuch words made Navia unhappy for a while. She thought herself quite fortunate. Her father loved her lots, and the adults and children around her also liked her. So why would someone regard her as one to be pitied? Perhaps, Navia thought, it was a matter of unclear communication leading to confusion. In which case, that wouldn't do, not at all.\nFrom then on, whenever little Navia felt loved, she would loudly declare: \"Thanks for liking me so much. That makes me very happy!\"",
            "Character Story 3\tNavia's original intention behind combining a gun with an umbrella was quite simple: she just didn't want to carry too much around, as this would affect her ability to conduct other business.\nIt rains often in Fontaine, and the rain gives way to merciless sun, so umbrellas are a must when going outdoors. And it would not do for the Demoiselle of the Spina to go without a gun, for surely none would think it an ornament in her hands.\nHer sharpshooting skills are born of much practice, with her principle being that any stance will do so long as you hit your shots — even propping your barrel atop a Blubberbeast is fine.\nClorinde, trained in the art of Marechaussee Hunter marksmanship, tends to shake her head at this, even as words of affirmation tumble out of her mouth. \"I find your optimism regarding battle is quite admirable.\"\nNavia takes that as praise. She met Clorinde when she was a (self-proclaimed) big girl of something over ten years, and is thus quite used to the latter's mannerisms. Yes, those are accurate words of praise, indeed!\nOptimism is indeed a rare psychological quality not to be undervalued. Many are those who intentionally seek to cultivate such a characteristic, yet prove unable to smile amidst life's struggles, while Navia appears to have been born with this ability. To her, there are only two types of trouble in this world: The solvable, and the unsolvable. Immediate action is the panacea to problems that can be eliminated, and as for those problems beyond one's power to change, then change yourself and learn acceptance.\nApart from optimism, Navia finds tolerance to be a value that brings real improvement to one's quality of life, and it is a virtue that extends to the Spina. Why, look at all the varied business ventures, and the people of all sorts — indeed, even a Tent Tortoise calls the place home!\nIt is said that this creature was a friend of Callas's named Consigliere, roughly meaning \"Counselor.\" Navia has also taken counsel with it in the past, finding it patient, quiet, and long-lived — just the sort of person you'd confide in. One day, Charlotte happened upon Navia babbling away to Consigliere, and out came her Kamera. The next thing anyone knew, many would come to speak to the Tent Tortoise on the picture's account. Navia herself would seek it out less from then on.\n\"Others should have a chance to chat with Monsieur Consigliere too,\" she would say with a straight face.",
            "Character Story 4\tThis world was probably full of contradictions from the beginning.\nTake Navia's father Callas for example. If the Spina di Rosula was more influential, a lot of things could get done more easily, but Callas stubbornly refused to accept the honorary title that the Palais Mermonia sought to grant him after the completion of the aquabus lines.\nAgain, Callas would never intentionally hide what the Spina did from his daughter, and would speak to her of all manner of business techniques, even personally or engaging others to teach her how to use weapons, as well as bringing her to the negotiating table, as if intending to groom her to be his successor. But at the same time, he never spoke of the cause of her mother's death, nor would he ever share his feelings with her. For a time, Navia was even confused as to whether she and her father were close or distant.\nLater, Navia slowly came up with a theory: That her father may have treated her so to protect her. He let her learn and build up wisdom in the hopes that she would become independent and be able to survive the crushing stresses of life. As for why he would not speak of his own pressures or pain, or even Clementine's death, it was most likely to spare his daughter sorrow or unnecessary guilt. And so he remained silent, never having a heart-to-heart with his own daughter, no matter how much he missed his wife.\nAs for his rejection of the title, this was possibly because he felt that Spina di Rosula would often be working with the common folk and a title like \"Duke Callas\" might create the perception of a difference in status between them, causing the Spina in turn to lose the trust of the people.\nStill, all of these are just Navia's own conclusions.\nThis is another area where Navia found herself conflicted. She was in all things valiant, and in business straightforward, but she never did seek her father out to confirm her conjectures.\n—Did you make those choices to protect me, Papa? Did you underestimate my ability to sort out my feelings, even though you trusted me?\nShe never spoke these thoughts aloud to her father. After all, she thought, they had time. Could she not wait until her stubborn old man stopped being so closed off, or until she had found better footing of her own, for them to have that conversation?\nIt was time that would answer her question, and teach her that which her father could not.\nSome things in life are like that, leaving only time for on-the-spot learning and no time for preparation, just as she would go on to organize her own memos after Melus's departure.\nWell, everyone makes mistakes at first, right? But don't worry — Navia's a fast learner.",
            "Character Story 5\tFontaine is the Nation of Hydro, and thus, from time immemorial, many tales about water have been flowing through it, such as the belief that the rain that falls is the Hydro Dragon Sovereign's tears and that the Great Terrestrial Lake holds the emotions of humanity...\nThe former is regarded as a ditty meant to pacify unruly children, while the latter is regarded by most to be unprovable, but as the matter of the \"prophecy\" progressed, people gradually turned to it for emotional sustenance.\nAs Fontaine's post-disaster reconstruction work steadily progressed, Navia found that more and more people began to stay a while and tarry by the water, especially around Poisson.\nAfter her accession as President, Navia was never one for slowing down or taking breaks. But once, when she was walking by the waterfront, she glimpsed her reflection in the surface and was suddenly struck by the desire to stop and stare, just as she had gazed at ponds when she was little.\nShe stooped down and scooped up some water, and watched as it drained away through the gaps between her fingers, till there was but a little left in her palm. Navia felt little from the water cupped in her hand, remembering only the traces of blood washed out by the rain, and the clothes left behind when the waters had retreated.\nShe had always been one to see the bright side of things, and did not wish for her sorrow to spread to her companions, and so she seldom cried. But thus did the unshed tears swollen with the river of the years at last find their outlet.\nThose tears were blown dry by the wind, and did not fall into the waters, but Navia believed that they would not fade with time.\nHer tears were utterly insignificant, but a drop in the ocean, but just as all other waters in this world, they would evaporate, condense, and fall as light rain, and with the wetness of each rainy season that came, they would meet again.",
            "The Right Time\tWhen Navia no longer needed to tiptoe to touch the shelf tops, Callas gave her a notebook. The book contained no dates and had no format, and even contained some text without punctuation — and was written by her mother, Clementine.\nWhile it was initially a welcome surprise, frustration and gloom took root in her heart as she read on.\nThe short essays began from the time Clementine went with Callas to visit the Fountain of Lucine. It seemed that from the moment they became intent on having a child, her mother would often think about her. In the golden sunflowers, she would see her child's hair, and in the bright lakes, her child's eyes.\nShe wrote down every last one of these hopes and blessings: May our child brim with beautiful virtues, try the many adventures and lovely cuisines the world has to offer, and experience all manner of joy and happiness.\nThis was not the first time Navia had read things her mother had written, but this instance certainly made her the happiest and angriest all at once. Why had her father only chosen to give this to her now!?\nBut her fury was not to last. She soon finished reading all the thin book had to offer, and its ending was one of devastating simplicity.\n\"Though I have written much about our child, I suppose these are, in the end, just my own wishes.\"\nFor some reason — their connection by blood, perhaps — Navia immediately understood the meaning of those words. Her mother had not wished for these hopes become a burden upon her growing child, and thus, her father had given this book into her keeping only after she had already grown into an adult by following her own path.\nThat day, Navia, did something quite rare, and did not go out, instead spending a long time in her room. Equally rare, also, was her acknowledgment of her father's arbitrary exercise of authority in this case.\nPerhaps her mother had once intended to give her this notebook herself, once she was grown... when the time was right.",
            "Vision\tAt a birthday party many years ago, Navia took her favorite tabletop game out.\nPerhaps it was because this was also her coming of age, but the participants playing that day were especially numerous. Amid this lively atmosphere, everyone — apart from the birthday girl, the star of the show — racked their brains coming up with characters exceedingly ill-suited to themselves.\nMelus, the steady hand, became the rash and careless commissioner, inviting all present to solve — or suffer under, more like — the ancient curse afflicting his family. Sonny, ever elegant in speech and etiquette, would play a potty-mouthed petty thief, even making the grand sacrifice of shedding his pale outer coat, which usually stuck to him like a second skin. The nervous rookie, Silver, having been dragged into this by dint of passing by, was made a mighty, mysterious mage.\nThe most lethal blow came when Clorinde, who usually took charge of proceedings, decided to \"band together\" with the famed adventurer known as \"Demoiselle\" as a private doctor who missed every shot she fired. Someone had to do the healing, she reasoned — but alas, this left the role of game master open, with Callas unfortunate enough to be the only one left to fill that post. Thus was he forced to put his soft drink aside, and leave the audience stands (the bench) for the crowd of players (the sofa).\nNavia was most pleased with this start.\nThe game, however, got off to a bumpy beginning, with the strange commissioner bursting his way into Demoiselle's residence during her birthday party, only to misjudge and crash head first into a triple-layered cake, nearly drowning himself in dessert and ending the millennia-spanning family curse by his own hand within the first five minutes.\nDemoiselle would quickly get the good-hearted doctor to save the man, with the doctor musing if letting him live on was tantamount to helping their enemies as she rolled the dice.\nThe game master's expression did not change as he went faithfully about his duty in a low voice:\n\"The young man, having braved the rain, was soaked to the bone, and both his hands were set a-trembling.\"\n\"He did his best to clean the cream off his face and body, though he missed a few spots.\"\n\"'Thank you, kind souls, thank you, for joining in my battle against this curse most wicked!'\"\nThey were unusually lucky during the middle portion of the game. To solve a problem, one must investigate its source. According to the mage's hypothesis, the commissioner's ancestor must have made a contract with a demon for some reason. \"Ah, if I had only rolled higher, we would already know that reason...\" grumbled the mage. \"Bloody signed a high-interest contract without a care for his descendants, didn't 'e, the blithering idiot?\" The thief blurted out. \"Well then, can we steal the document and destroy it?\" Demoiselle asked offhandedly.\nThe inexperienced game master would regret allowing their actions for all time, for the thief's luck was truly ludicrous.\n\"...Demoiselle was clever indeed, and the thief just as profoundly skilled.\"\n\"No one thought that the contract would fall into their hands so easily, and yet the words written upon it were nigh indecipherable...\"\nThe ending, too, was unusually happy. Thanks to the hardworking and kind (and also sufficiently rusty) game master, Demoiselle would finally drag the rest of the party, riddled as they were with status effects, into a confrontation with the ancient demon. The battle was as chaotic as ever, with the mage losing his sanity first, and the doctor not landing a single shot. But just as everyone's hit points were about to bottom out, the adventurer Demoiselle would hazard a venture. Using up a turn to move beside the demon, and tanking a full round of its attacks head-on, she knowingly gave the doctor a desperate order, as everything was going to hell: \"Shoot me instead!\"\nThe doctor's dice were rolled before the game master could say anything. Callas counted the dice in silence, before taking three deep breaths.\n\"...The bullet pierces the demon’s weak spot, and the giant creature collapses into the abyss.\"\n\"It returns to the darkness, and into slumber, taking that absurd curse with it.\"\n\"Rejoice, rejoice, for the adventurer's courage and for her ill-omened ally!\"\nPerhaps it was to go with the President's flow or out of genuine emotion, but there was indeed much rejoicing. Amidst the din, only Callas, who had begun to sort out the various items used for play, was stunned. He retrieved a golden-yellow jewel from within the dice box.\n\"Navia... I think this is yours.\"\nThere were many people present, but this Vision did indeed belong to Navia, for it was with a flash of her thought that a great blade of Geo would slice her birthday cake in two... along with the table.\nLater at night, when the party and her excitement both had settled down, Navia would lie on her bed, unable to remember what she had been thinking when she had obtained the Vision. Had her mind lingered on the final victory, obtained only after much struggle and hardship? Or had she wished that her birthdays henceforth would be spent surrounded by friends, just like this one?\nIf it was the former, that seemed to obliquely indicate that a happy ending must be preceded by many tribulations... so best to go with the latter.\nThus were her thoughts as she lay at dreamland's door, still clutching the Vision."

Or more pertinently, who was responsible for spreading it in the first place... Well, never mind. I don't think that the Hydro Dragon would \"weep,\" per se. I think he just finds himself a little stirred when he gets a taste of the tears that have been shed on this land, on account of all the emotions they contain.",
            "About Neuvillette: The Meaning of Trials\tThis is a topic that has been discussed ad nauseum... I don't mean to condescend to humanity, but it is quite clear to me that society's concepts of justice, fairness, equality, and rule of law are not equivalent, and never can be. Now of course, water always seeks its own level, and it was in this spirit that the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria, hoped to achieve universal equality by connecting all things with love. Her successor chose instead to seek equality by means of the law. Ultimately, due to various external factors, this unfortunately manifested itself in the distorted form of trials for the sake of trials. Nevertheless, there are reasons for everything. I suppose I should refrain from criticizing her.",

            "About Us: The Human World\tThe time that I have spent living among the citizens of Fontaine, and traveling with you, has transformed my views. Even though before this I had pardoned the sins of humanity long ago, I can promise you that my future judgments will not cause any harm to the common folk. That being said, my grievances with the usurpers have yet to be settled... They owe a debt of blood that shall not be forgotten.",
            "About the Vision: I\tI was once advised to wear a counterfeit Vision, so that I might more easily intervene during moments of crisis. To be quite frank, I was not enamored by this suggestion, nor the implication that one must only exercise the power that is rightfully theirs under false pretenses. With that said, however, I have developed a newfound appreciation for the value of human yearning and determination having spent considerable time around Vision-bearing humans.",

            "Something to Share: Laws\tFontaine does have some rather intriguing laws on its books.

That last one was my personal contribution.",

            "Interesting Things: Vishaps\tThe Vishaps' ancestry can be traced directly back to the Fontemer, which is why they are so adept at evolution. I am reminded of an old custom that the dragons once observed: We would take a sip of our perished young brethren's blood. Whenever the tides are disrupted by the motion of the moon and stars, the water within the bodies of us Hydro organisms surges up towards our heads, reminding us that our deceased kin will soon be revived.",
            "Interesting Things: Humans\tFrom my observations, humans have a tendency to view themselves as being in opposition with nature. And whenever this point is raised, someone is always quick to respond by declaring that humans are in fact a part of nature, like any other organism. To someone like me, however, who knows an inkling of the truth, what would be most beneficial is if human civilization and the natural world of this planet could seek ways to co-exist with one another.",
            "About the Geo Archon\tNothing will stop me from rendering judgment on each of The Seven. As the Archon who won the Authority of Geo, Deus Auri must be called to trial. If one does not wish to see us on opposite sides of a conflict, they need not worry, for I intend to stay in Fontaine for the foreseeable future, which could well mean another four hundred years. As another point of consolation, even when the trial eventually takes place, it is still not a given that the judgment will lead to a physical confrontation.",
            "About the Anemo Archon\tI shall fulfill my vow to judge all of The Seven in turn, even if the sky should fall and the ground give way. As the recipient of the Authority of Anemo, the God of Breeze and Hope must also stand trial. ...Hmm? He spends most of his time being a harmless drunkard? Well, even so, I must meet him for myself and proceed from there.",
            "About the Electro Archon\tAs a survivor of the dragon race who has regained my full dragonhood, I must fulfill my oaths and obligations even if it means returning all the water in the oceans back to the heavens. In taking the Authority of Electro, the Narukami placed herself on the list of the usurpers, she will... Oh, you say she has isolated herself in the Plane of Euthymia, and now rarely appears in public? Then I shall pay her a visit in another few centuries.",
            "About the Dendro Archon\tThough the day will come when I put her on trial, I must commend the God of Verdure on her sense of responsibility. Few things are without flaws in this world, but the devotion and benevolence she displays are a testament to her commitment to continued progress. I felt enormous regret when I learned of the mistreatment she has endured over the past five hundred years.",
            "About Wriothesley\tWriothesley is a trustworthy man. I fought hard for the title and reputation he now has. I expect you to think that I've simply been duped by his flattery and appearance of loyalty... But to that, I would quote the Inazuman proverb: \"The words unspoken are the flower.\" Which means, some things are best left unsaid.",
            "About Clorinde\tClorinde's peerless skills have made her the most powerful Champion Duelist in our nation. As a successor to the Marechaussee Hunters of old, she plays a vital role in ensuring the fairness and impartiality of the courtroom. Also, she's actually not as stoic as she might appear.",
            "About Lyney and Lynette\tTheir performances are just fascinating, don't you think? They draw you into a magical world where, on one hand, everything that takes place is part of an elaborate deception — but on the other, all manner of miracles are possible if you are only willing to believe.",
            "About Sigewinne\tI don't know how Sigewinne is faring these days. But if I hear so much as the whiff of a rumor that she's being bullied, I shall summon Wriothesley here and demand an explanation. She's so kind and vulnerable... She brought me some Kamera film the last time she visited, and asked to listen to more of my commentary on the water of Natlan... How long is it until her next vacation?",
            "About Furina\tNow, the curtain has finally fallen on her \"performance\"... The character she portrayed was an imaginary one, yet in playing that role she fulfilled her duties... Though she is meek and full of doubt by nature, she was able to use madness to stiffen her resolve and see her duty through to its conclusion. The work that she has done over the centuries is truly immense. If she were to ever make a return to the stage, I should personally attend the performance and give her my heartfelt applause... Yes, I must do so when the opportunity arises.",
            "About Navia\tI regret to say that after my various interactions with her — such as when I inadvertently angered her, and when I accepted her apology — and even now, in spite of the guilt I continue to feel over what happened to her father, I feel... very distant from her, as if I'm observing the starry sky from the bottom of a deep lake. It is by no means intentional, and I also know it is not something that I can easily make up for. Unlike water, emotion does not settle quickly once agitated, nor is it naturally inclined towards equilibrium.",
            "More about Neuvillette: I\tI usually do my best to avoid forming personal relationships, or even collaborating with others outside of established procedures. But you have shown yourself to be trustworthy, and you have no problematic entanglements with Fontaine's local factions. Therefore, I would be pleased to journey with you.",
            "More about Neuvillette: II\tThis is something that I can only say in private — I could never publicly share my views on this matter: It positively baffles me that Fonta has managed to become such a popular drink. Though, I suppose its appeal to humans is not beyond comprehension. One can both rehydrate and replenish blood sugar in one gulp, and at an exceptionally cheap price.",
            "More about Neuvillette: III\tI went to see an opera recently. It was about a lady whose personal charm and manipulative schemes allowed her to continue to dominate the affairs of the grand mansion where she lived even after her death, like a ghost that refused to be exorcised. The acting was impeccable, and the story exceptional. It also reminded me of the current state of affairs in the real world.",
            "More about Neuvillette: IV\tFor a number of reasons, I rarely leave Fontaine. As a result, though I enjoy tasting spring water from all over the world, I always have it delivered to me here, rather than collecting it myself. And yes, subtle as the flavor differences between samples of different regions may be, I am perfectly capable of distinguishing between them. Do you still doubt me? I am the Iudex. I do not lie.",
            "More about Neuvillette: V\tI have to say, my daily life is not without its inconveniences. For instance, I often find myself stepping on my robes as I sit down, or squashing my coiffure against the chair. And if I lean my head too far back, sometimes my hair even gets caught in the ornamentation. Nevertheless, I must wear these garments to maintain the dignity of a Chief Justice, and endure whatever inconveniences this entails. Incidentally, the world at large appears to operate on this general principle, too. Everyone is faced with an identity that they must accept, endure, understand, and eventually learn to co-exist with. This has been my experience all along.",
            "Neuvillette's Hobbies\tWater tasting is a rather sophisticated discipline. Pyro-heated water has the standard \"au naturel\" flavor found ubiquitously in the natural world, while water boiled using charcoal has distinctly rustic notes. Similarly, while Cryo-chilled water is cold but otherwise unremarkable, the frozen rivers of Snezhnaya, when melted, produce a water with an entirely different flavor profile altogether.",
            "Neuvillette's Troubles\tPeople seem to respond to the sight of a man in the rain without an umbrella as if it were some sort of strange spectacle.",
            "Favorite Food\tAnimals can survive for weeks without food, but merely a few days without water. There is no dish that could ever compare to pure, unadulterated water. With that in mind, food items that contain plenty of liquid are the next best thing.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tHow can people bring themselves to consume deep-fried foods? Or grilled food with no sauce? The worst culprits in my view are those Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cakes. Surely, even eating a dehumidifying agent would be kinder on the stomach?",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tDelicious. An abundance of juices, and the ingredients have been cooked to perfection.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tA fine effort indeed. My only advice would be to increase the liquid content and reduce the amount of fat.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tToo dry. A dish devoid of moisture has no way to convey the intentions of the chef.",
            "Birthday\tAh, so it's your birthday. Happy birthday. I do not know if rain is in the forecast today, but let me see what I can do.",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tNow that I have reclaimed one of the Seven Authorities from the hands of the usurpers, I have regained my true form.

            "Character Story 1\tNeuvillette is not known for his personal desires.\nCurious members of the public and journalists are wont to seek high and low for him all across Fontaine when he is not sitting in the Chief Justice's seat of judgment. He may sit at a seat for specially invited guests during performances, appear by the shore when the skies are just on the cusp of weeping, or be standing within the shadows cast by the afternoon sun.\nThere was once a time when all believed that he was some kind of demon who existed solely to preside over trials and judge, forcing him to clarify that... Well, the gist of it was \"to bear witness and judge is my great honor, but I am not a trial aficionado. Iudex is simply one of the hats I wear, and my time as a judge is but one phase of my life.\"\nThis successful clarification led him out of the frying pan, and into the fire, as they say, with still more troublesome rumors emerging — \"Shocking News! Neuvillette Claims 'Iudex' to be 'Springboard' Post! Unspeakable Plans Next; Where Will His Ambition End?\"\nAs for the new rumors, Neuvillette paid them no heed. Perhaps they were, in fact, right on the Mora, and he simply did not correct them out of principle? No one knows.\nNeuvillette is also not much of a drinker, nor does he like Fonta — indeed, he has never even been known to have given any sincere praise to the local chefs' most renowned dishes. This has led people to suspect that his lack of consumptive desire might come down to him simply not having a sense of taste.\nHis response was to organize a water-tasting salon party, at which all were gobsmacked by the wide variety of flavors water from different regions could possess and floored by the Iudex's most refined tastes. Of course, the amount of authenticity present in such interactions cannot be known.\nBut whatever the case, Neuvillette really is devoid of selfish want.",
            "Character Story 2\tNeuvillette is a just person.\nIf not for that quality, he probably would not have been qualified to serve as the Iudex in the first place.\nTo the children, the job of the man in the judge's seat is nothing more than wearing a wig, maintaining order in the court, and being the Oratrice's messenger pigeon. In truth, however, there are many administrative affairs that he must handle in private to keep the justice system up and running.\nDue to certain historical and traditional legacies in Fontaine, the Iudex also has the right to prosecute, as well as the power to enforce the law in person. This was originally intended to make it easier to maintain law and order during chaotic times, but as the system became further refined, this rule, which represented the spirit of the pioneer far more than that of the law, became maintained only symbolically. When the Iudex investigates a case or serves as the prosecutor, they must recuse themselves as judge, and have someone else take the seat. And in the few instances where he has personally investigated cases, Neuvillette has unerringly followed this rule.\nOne thing to note is that he has been the only Iudex in the land for a very long time, so much so that people often speculate that he must have been given an unimaginably long life due to divine favor. As such, it is well that he is nothing if not fair-minded, or such an extensive term would surely lead to problems someday.\nAs to what he is precisely — a familiar of the Hydro Archon, or a mysterious Hydro elemental creature, perhaps — there are a great many opinions, though Neuvillette has never once commented on such talk.\nIndeed, he is a person most impartial.",
            "Character Story 3\tDue to a variety of reasons, Fontaine's legal codices retain all manner of odd articles from days past. Neuvillette himself contributed this clause: \"A Melusine shall be addressed as 'she,' rather than 'it,' for they are people too.\"\nThis might look strange on its face, but the more one considers it, the more it makes sense. After all, Melusines have been found all over Fontaine since near-modern times, and fighting for equal rights for them beginning with terms of address sent a powerful signal.\nIndeed, Fontainians have noticed that Neuvillette displays different amounts of warmth toward Melusines and humans. Most regard this as the understated goodness in his heart having found an outlet, becoming the love of a father.\nOddly enough, this one only gets stranger the more one knows about Neuvillette.\nFor he is the Hydro Dragon, and in this capacity, he regards Melusines as dependents and successors, and also as the finest example of a new sort of Hydro Vishap species. Yet he is also the destroyer of the present order, the one who shall judge all gods, and the foe of humanity. So why, then, did he secure human rights for the Melusines?\nYou alone could ask him this question, and this was his reply: \"It wasn't up to me. Melusines simply prefer being around humans, that's all.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tNeuvillette has always favored rainy days over sunny ones, as the moisture-laden air helps him relax. However, it has been a long time since he last delighted in standing under the rain.\nIt seems that from the time he chose to walk alongside Fontaine, he began to play the role of a strictly law-abiding normal person. Of course, normal people would not walk through the rain without an umbrella, allowing the rain to drench their hair.\nIt is worth mentioning that the role of Chief Justice is as much his true self as the Hydro Dragon is his essence. Only the role of \"normal human\" is one he must play.\nIt was in their solitude and guilt that humans invented a god to judge them, and in their greed and guilt that they created a god to save them. And with that god no longer present, it falls to Neuvillette to fulfill such expectations.\nHe has pardoned humanity, and has regained his original form.\nNow, he can finally walk in the rain and enjoy it.\nIndeed, he did do exactly this, and standing in the rain, he gazed into the distance, reminiscing about that day, so long ago, when he had received that letter.\nYes, a letter had found its way to him by some unknown means. The name of the recipient had been left blank, with the text only addressing him bluntly as \"you.\"\nA special you. A unique you. Neuvillette was not opposed to such a manner, but neither did he approve of it. He felt, vaguely, that the powers-that-be of the present world had no real right to judge him so.\nHe knew that this letter had been written by the Archon Focalors, who was inviting him to come and see Fontaine, claiming \"I shall leave you a seat with the best view in the greatest theater.\"\nLater, he would indeed come to receive that very seat — in the middle of the front row of the Opera Epiclese on the island known as Erinnyes. He would watch all manner of performances there, and the view was indeed excellent, just as Focalors had claimed.\nWhat happened later was not made public knowledge. In all likelihood, the people had no way of understanding what it meant that the throne was shattered, or how the power of water was fully restored to its original owner. As to their being pardoned, and why they had to be forgiven in the first place, that was an even broader and more complex tale.\nAnd thus did the curtain fall — Fontaine witnessed a happy ending to the greatest drama in history.\nOr was it? A happy ending, that is. It was then that Neuvillette understood that the \"seat\" mentioned in the letter was not merely a chair in an opera house.\nFocalors — or Furina, he should say — had given up her seat in the audience, come onstage alone, and become the heroine of the drama.\nThere were only ever a fixed number of seats, and for one to sit down, was for another to depart. That letter had been an invitation, issued several centuries in advance.\nWell, Hydro Dragon? How do you feel about becoming a member of the human audience?\nAre you enjoying this human drama?",
            "Character Story 5\tOne as great as he should have no need for a constellation to shine over him. After all, \"fate\" is merely the manner in which the present ruler of this world plays with living beings.\nNow that he has obtained one part of seven of the authority over the mortal realm, and reforged the throne and title of a \"Fully Fledged Dragon,\" he is one strong enough to equal and rival \"the human realm,\" and logic would dictate that he need not subscribe to this system known as \"fate.\"\nHe can see, in the skies of destiny, how many stars contend with one another, creating a complicated, fragile world. He did not initially care much about such, for the puppet strings glossed as \"divine rules\" would one day be burned away by the fires of judgment. But he too was taken in by certain pleasing rhetoric.\n\"In that case, why don't you just watch over the Fontainians? They were born from the Primordial Sea, after all. That makes them part of this planet's native life, too, and a form of life that requires your care.\"\nHe would never admit that he himself had become quite fascinated with the joys and sorrows of humanity. Was it not so, he would argue, that humans find their gaze stolen by the ripples from falling raindrops in puddles? And could it not be, he would explain, that King Nibelung had been wrong, and that the black void could only be opposed if all life were to band together as one?\nThus did he, in the end, come into his own \"fate.\" The skies had left a special, ennobled place for him, one reserved for the overseers and those who could defy the world itself — that of his own reflection.\n—Of course, he was born in the form of a human. But why, then, is his constellation the image of the great leviathan? Well, this leads us to a more mundane explanation for the situation, one quite separate from grave matters of the world's fate:\nAs the one named \"Neuvillette,\" he would often be roped by Melusines (especially Sigewinne) into a bit of astrology via The Steambird's constellation columns or astrology guides from Sumeru. Would it really do, at that point, to tell them that he \"didn't have a constellation\" or that his own constellation was just \"Neuvillette\"?",
            "A Fontainian Nursery Rhyme\t\"Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry.\"\nNo one knows who composed this children's song, or when, but it has organically spread throughout Fontaine all the same. Neuvillette has been somewhat perplexed by this. No matter how much time he has spent with Fontainians or how much they've been through together, he still cannot quite put a finger on how people view the real him — or that is to say, the Hydro Dragon.\nIn addition to commanding the power of Hydro, the Hydro Dragon also had mastery over the sea that was the source of life. Before any outside life forms were ever created, all life on this planet traced its origins to the Primordial Sea. Indeed, those placid waters were worthy of the title of \"birthing waters\" or \"amniotic fluid\" given by those who came after. And the Hydro Dragon could, in turn, be regarded as this planet's original \"God of Life.\"\nNeuvillette knows all this, of course, just like he knows that all rivers meet again in the great ocean. These birthing waters might not be of any special importance to humans, but for Neuvillette, he can differentiate every drop, every minute memory. He still remembers the foreign usurper appointing their own \"God of Life\" to order the living. He still remembers how the usurper had made \"her\" to suppress the original vital force of this planet. And of course, he also knows how \"she\" came to commit the original sin...\nHaving considered all this, Neuvillette decided, then, that whoever had penned that rhyme, as well as the Fontainians who came to believe in it, must not have known the Hydro Dragon all that well, considering that they thought the Hydro Dragon could cry. What did they take said Dragon for, some sort of bleeding heart who grieved for humans and the heavens alike?",
            "Vision\tNeuvillette does not need a Vision to manipulate the elements. However, there were some things he learned only after regaining his complete form:\nSeverely wounded in the great war of vengeance, the usurper had their functions ruined, and could no longer use their absolute authority to suppress the original order of this world. To continue to subdue and control the resentments and loathing of the world, the usurper and one who came after created the Gnoses together. So it came to be that an order was made to be upheld, and thus did humans come to only possess these seven remembrances, and all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other.\nFrom that day on, whenever a person's wishes reached the heavens, the seven overseers of the material realm were duty-bound to grant them a gift. Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred, the Seven Archons still had to impart a shattered shard of their mastery to that person. And when one so gifted completed their duty... the gift the gods would receive in return would be more abundant still.\nNeuvillette obeys no edict from the heavens, but he does acknowledge human will. So he too set aside parts of himself, as like unto the dragon-treasure hoards of old, awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them."

            "Character Story 4\tAlthough she has lived her entire life in Sumeru, the city of wisdom, Nilou has never shown any talent in the field of \"knowledge.\" However, she always knows how to soothe the emotions of others in her own way.\n\"This is probably a generous gift to me from Lesser Lord Kusanali.\"\nAfter learning to dance with her teacher, Nilou became deeply aware of the power of body language.\nCombining her talents and knowledge of body language, she created her very own form of \"body movement therapy.\"\nFor example, when Mr. Zubayr is angry, everyone in the theater would be walking on eggshells.\nBut Nilou would keep a warm smile, drawing wonderful patterns one after another in the air with her arms and fingers.\n\"Imagine that we are in the rainforest that has just rained, and that you are following me as we walk onward, saying hello to every animal that passes by, waving, leaving everything else behind...\"\nPerhaps this may seem childish and funny to a bystander, but for those who are wrapped up in the moment, Nilou's gentle voice can cause the anger that clouds their minds to disappear before they even know it.\nWhat's even more amazing is that, according to Mr. Afshin, this body movement therapy has been trending recently — and it even works on his two stubborn Sumpter Beasts...",
            "Character Story 5\tBe it in day-to-day life or her performances on stage, Nilou has always maintained a simple attitude —\nTo melt everyone's worries away and let comfort and ease waltz in.\nBut when \"trouble\" comes to her, she is often distressed due to her inability to make the call.\nTahchin sure is delicious, but Pita Pocket is also good, and I also saw someone holding a Potato Boat that seemed really yummy. Which one should I eat tonight?\nI've heard people talk about places outside Sumeru City... the pure white snowy mountain and windmills the size of giants... Should I also consider going out for a trip?\nNilou can often find good reasons to go with any of the options she is considering, and so they are like Forest Tree Frogs sitting across from one another with bellies out, not one able to win the others over.\nBut if there was a person who could make a decision at this time and tell her with confidence and calm:\n\"Why not have half the amount of each and share them with me?\"\n\"And as for those places you have never been to, I have already set foot there. I can assure you that they are safe.\"\n...Nilou would dismiss her hesitation in an instant and raise her arms in a dance-like graceful gesture of thanks, before indulging in the joy of having solved a great problem for a long time indeed.",
            "Letters from the Audience\tRefusing to accept gifts on stage has been a long-standing rule in the Zubayr Theater.\nSometimes, the audiences do still get too excited and may insist on giving various kinds of gifts to Nilou. That said, such givers will definitely receive a gift in return the very next day, along with a note that has been left at their doors...\n\"Thank you for your kindness. If you would like to express your love for Nilou's dance, you may write a letter to the Zubayr Theater instead of sending gifts.\"\nAnd so it came to pass that like snow flakes dancing and falling in the air, letters filled with the audience members' passionate praise have been sent in batches and droves by the Dusk Birds to the theater's mailbox.\nDuring her free time when there are no shows or rehearsals, Nilou will read every letter carefully, share this joy with the other members of the Zubayr Theater, and then carefully preserve these letters.\nEvery word and every expression of recognition and fondness in the letters is worth remembering and appreciating.\nAs Nilou bettered her dancing skills, more and more people came to watch her dance, and in time, the letters have added up to quite the stack indeed.\nBut if someone cracks a joke, saying that Nilou is the most valuable treasure in the Zubayr Theater, she will definitely shake her head with a sweet smile.\n\"Our most valuable treasure is our audience's love, and it is all carefully stored in one mysterious box.\"",
            "Vision\tNilou has heard her teacher talk about the meaning of dance more than once. From her teacher's perspective, dance is born from human life and has belonged to everyone from the very beginning.\n\"As a dancer, you should convey emotions on stage, and your audience's smiles are their response to the emotions conveyed in your dance.\"\nNilou was well aware that she was nowhere near as good at thinking about the \"meaning\" behind things as Akademiya researchers. But still, she practiced diligently each day under the direction of her teacher and planned to continue following in her footsteps.\nWhen she finally first took the stage, she quickly became completely immersed in the performance, holding nothing back.\nShe thought of the wind, the moon, the gentle sound of the rose blooming, the feeling of stroking the tail feathers of Dusk Birds, and a myriad of beautiful things that existed in this world.\nShe wanted to display the beauty she perceived in her heart to the entire audience through her dance.\nSlowly, splashes of water ran together, converging into a lake on the stage. Like a Crystalfly dancing on a lake's surface, Nilou gently fluttered back and forth, and the lake-mirror rippled slightly in time to her steps.\nLike a water lily, her body swirled in the middle of that lake. Amazed at such pure and flawless beauty, the audience almost forgot to breathe.\nAfter the curtain fell, Nilou flopped down on the backstage chair and took deep breaths.\nLike dewdrops on a lotus leaf, a Hydro Vision had appeared at her waist.\nNilou thought then that she had perhaps found the purpose of dance at last — \n\"To become beauty, and then to convey the beauty and value of art.\""

            "Character Details\tThe \"Liyue Qixing\" controls all of the commerce that takes place in Liyue Harbor. Its highly-revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a low profile.\nThe \"Tianquan\" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. \nShe is seen as an excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly elder sister to kids, a socialite at the banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town, and everyone seems to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of Ningguang, with great discrepancies between the versions.\nStill, if there's one thing all the rumors about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.",
            "Character Story 1\tUp above Liyue Harbor, there is a floating palace held up by Plaustrite. It is known as the \"Jade Chamber,\" and it belongs to Ningguang.\nOn a clear day, one can see almost all of Liyue Harbor from the decks outside the palace gates.\nWhenever Ningguang has important business matters to handle, she invariably comes to this floating palace. She strictly forbids anyone from accessing the premises except for her three trusted confidants. Her confidants sort through the relevant information, summarize it and hang the summaries on the wall, while Ningguang rests against the railings, enjoying the view of Liyue and quietly mulling everything over.\nShe is certain to arrive at the perfect solution before her confidants have finished adding everything to the wall. Once she has made her decision she shreds everything and throws it out of the window, creating something of a snowstorm of paper.\nThe handwriting on the shredded pieces of paper stands out like ink in the snow to all of the merchants in Liyue Harbor.\nFor they know that whenever Ningguang's shredded snow falls, a huge change is about to descend on the business community.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Ningguang knows everything,\" foreigners will often find the Liyue locals warning them.\nLoophole-hunting guilds, market-manipulating hoarders, smugglers coming ashore with their illicit goods... The Tianquan knows all the details, good, bad, and ugly.\nOnce, an alchemist from Sumeru was traveling in Liyue and unwittingly happened across the records of a certain noctilucous jade transaction involving the Blackcliff Forge ten years prior. That night, someone from Ningguang's inner circle knocked on his window and invited him to join Ningguang in the Jade Chamber for a talk.\nRumor has it that Ningguang has enchanted the Jade Chamber in such a way that allows her to eavesdrop on everyone in the city's private conversations...\nThe truth is that Ningguang's eyes and ears are in fact the children who play on the streets in Liyue Harbor.\nBetween them, they are aware of every confidential meeting, every private conversation, and every new visitor to the city. When Ningguang gathers them around, her promise of delicious treats proves to be an irresistible incentive, and so they tell her everything they know.\nOnce she has finished carefully cross-referencing everything she has learned from the children against other sources, there is no secret hidden from her in Liyue Harbor.\nShe understands the value of reciprocity more than anyone, which is why she is more than willing to invest time in mingling with the common folk.\nOn top of that, she does actually like seeing the children smile.",
            "Character Story 3\tNingguang's attitude to making money is largely the same as anyone else's: You can never have enough.\nBut money to her is more than just a sign of wealth — each Mora is a trophy of a hard-won victory.\nNingguang is kind and friendly toward the common folk, but this is a side of her that none of her business associates could ever hope to see.\nTo her, the business world is a playground, and the zero-sum games are the most exciting. Each round she wins against a wealthy merchant brings a gleeful smile to her face as they sigh and reluctantly hand over the Mora, and nothing makes her happier than seeing the guilds bow to her wishes.\nEvery victory in this game adds to the wealth of the Liyue Qixing. Liyue Harbor prospers as a result, and this in turn creates more business opportunities and more profit for Ningguang. Every member of the Liyue Qixing is more than happy with this perfect cycle of interlocking interests.\nPeople often ask Ningguang why she is still doing business in Liyue Harbor when she has already acquired such vast wealth.\n\"Vast wealth is a wonderful thing.\"\nNingguang patiently replies, never able to understand why people would ask such foolish questions.\n\"Adding another Mora to the pot can hardly make it any less wonderful, now, can it?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tEveryone living in Liyue Harbor has to abide by the rules. Those who do so will see their interests protected, while those who violate the rules will be punished accordingly.\nThe rules are rooted in ancient laws set down by Morax, Liyue Harbor's divine protector, and they are absolute. Over the millennia, each Tianquan has introduced amendments to the rules to ensure they are well aligned with current societal needs.\nThe laws are compiled and published along with a 279-page commentary, and a copy is given to each citizen of Liyue.\nNingguang likes it this way: Law and order is good for business, and she understands the intricacies of the laws that forge the order better than anyone else.\nHowever, there was a certain ship captain by the name of Beidou who acted with flagrant disregard for the rules, smuggling contraband goods by leveraging her exotic cargo and exclusive business intelligence. To Ningguang, captain Beidou was the black sheep of Liyue Harbor's business community.\nAs Tianquan, it fell to Ningguang to impose heavy fines on Beidou each time she transgressed the rules. But much to her consternation, Beidou seemed to take these fines in her stride, like water off a duck's back.\nOutside of the official channels, too, Ningguang tried to find ways to implore Beidou to change her ways and stop putting the Qixing in such a difficult position. In response, Beidou simply explained away her actions as \"enacting justice,\" \"helping the poor\" and \"keeping the sailors in their jobs.\" As a firm believer in the principle of live and let live, Beidou had no time for Ningguang's advice.\nIn the end, Ningguang agreed to disagree and gave up trying to convince the stubborn Beidou to change.",
            "Character Story 5\tBeing the charming and wealthy woman that she is, Ningguang has never had a shortage of suitors.\nIt seems that every eligible bachelor, from the young esquires of Yujing Terrace, to accomplished young businessmen, to renowned sea captains, has at some point invested substantial energy into trying to win Ningguang's affection. One rumor even has it that a wealthy businessman from the Court of Fontaine signed a major trade deal with Liyue Harbor for the sole reason that it would mean he could see Ningguang more often.\nNingguang treats all her suitors with an equal measure of kindness and grace, but also keeps them at distance — enough to keep them interested but not push them away. Curiosity got the better of everyone in town, and now everyone wants to know: Who is Ningguang's lover? \nLittle do they know, Ningguang has no love for finite things, and will certainly not be bound by something that is finite.\nThe Jade Chamber, a floating palace above Liyue Harbor, belongs to Ningguang alone. It started out about the size of a room, but has since grown so large that in the moonlight it casts its shadow over the whole of Liyue.\nA portion of Ningguang's seemingly limitless wealth goes towards hiring skilled craftsmen to continue the expansion and refurbishment of the Jade Chamber, ensuring that it becomes ever more extravagant as time goes by.\nTo Ningguang, the Jade Chamber is a symbol of her wealth and power, and a sign that her business is flourishing.\nSave for Mora, it is the thing Ningguang loves most in the world — because it is infinite.\nOne day, she insists, it will cast its shadow over all the seven nations of Teyvat.",
            "Chess Game: Liyue Millennial\tNingguang invented a form of chess to pass the time.\nThis chessboard not only contains to-scale reproductions of Liyue Harbor's natural and urban geography, vendors, tea houses, shops, hotels and miscellaneous stores, but it also contains six, ten and twelve-sided dice (among others). Players use the dice to determine how far their chess pieces move, and landing on various locations will trigger different events. Victory in-game is decided by the number of counters in each player's hands.\nThe rules can change at any time according to Ningguang's fancies, and when playing with others, she will always follow the newest rule set that she has on hand.\nWhen she's truly feeling the spirit, she will even design new rules on the spot — no one has yet beaten her at this game, and she has now reached the 32.6th edition of her rulebook.\nShe marketed the 8th edition of the game to the general public, believing it to be the easiest to understand, but it proved to still be far too complicated for ordinary folk.\nNonetheless, people flock to purchase sets on account of the beauty and intricacy of the model pieces.\nIn truth, more people buy it for the models than for the game.",
            "Vision\tNo one knows how Visions are created — they have always seemed to just appear out of thin air, leaving the countless unacknowledged in the lurch without a clue as to how to get one.\nAs for Visions left behind after their users die, they are masterless husks without any elemental power, nor is any method of reawakening them known, save for a tiny chance that it may resonate with another — and only one such \"other\" at a time...\nNingguang's first thought upon seeing such an object a subconscious \"oh, look, a new business opportunity.\"\nPutting this up for sale would surely have the rich shelling out for it. And if they can't resonate with it, why, they'll just use it to keep up appearances. A sound call either way...\nAnd if there should be a way to collect such empty shells, could this not become a long term business?\nPlaying with the jewel in one hand, Ningguang began writing plans for an auction in the other, her smile widening as she thought about the riches to be had — and at that moment, the Vision shone forth its light.\nNingguang's smile froze as the Vision activated.\nHer attendants, coming upon the sight of their mistress, awakened Vision in hand, began to congratulate her on having obtained a priceless treasure.\nNingguang, for her part, seemed annoyed instead.\n\"What's there to be happy about? Once broken, considered sold!\""

            "Hello\tMy name is Noelle, maid of the Knights of Favonius, and it's my pleasure to be joining you on your adventure today. Should you encounter any problems at all at any point throughout your journey, please do not hesitate to call me and I will be delighted to provide you with my full assistance. Yes, starting right now — what do you need?",
            "Chat: A Favor\tLeave it to me! All of it, whatever it is! ...What... exactly is \"it\"? I didn't quite catch your request...",
            "Chat: Rest\tYou seem tired. Would you like some tea? I'll brew you some. Do you take sugar? One cube, or two?",
            "Chat: Being Reliable\tWhenever you need me, I'll be there.",
            "When It Rains\tOh dear, everyone's laundry is still on the line! May I be excused to fetch it in?",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tPlease stay indoors until the storm passes. I will deal with any urgent outdoor business.",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tMmm, such fair weather. Why don't we do a bit of sunny work? Oh, what sort of work is that, you ask? Haha, well, anything that makes you feel bright and sunny too.",
            "When It's Windy\tAhh... Can you hear the Anemo Archon's voice on the breeze? It calms me down whenever I get flustered.",
            "Good Morning\tGood morning! Breakfast is served. I will be on hand the whole time. Should you find that anything is not to your taste, please, do not hesitate to let me know.",
            "Good Afternoon\tReady for your tea break? Please wait here while I get it ready. Oh yes, I also made Lighter-Than-Air Pancakes! You simply must try one, it's my specialty.",
            "Good Evening\tEveryone has free time in the evening, and that is when I am busiest. Where have Amber's washed hairbands been placed? How many new eyepatches did Kaeya buy? Keeping track of all these things is a maid's responsibility.",
            "Good Night\tPlease get some rest, you must be tired from today's adventure. I should head back to the Knights of F— Sorry? You want me to watch over you until you fall asleep? I—I... I mean, of course, it's no problem. But, um... You're not just teasing me, are you?",
            "About Noelle: Discipline\tIn my job, I do the exact same things every day — a far cry from being a true knight, that's for sure. But ultimately, this is all part of my training, and when it comes to training, actions speak louder than words.",
            "About Noelle: Disagreement\tI'm a bit useless in an argument because I can't really explain my reasoning clearly. People find that hard to understand, so instead, I try to just get on with my work in my own way. But then they call me stubborn. All I try to do is convince people with results instead of trying to talk them round... Is that really stubborn of me?",
            "About Us: Identities\tI am devoted to what I do, but make no mistake — I devote myself freely. A maid, to me, is the most liberating job there is. I'm a chef, a gardener, a warrior, a guide... I can be anything you need me to be!",
            "About Us: Reminders\tEven when you're too busy to eat three square meals, never eat something if you don't know where it came from, and always maintain a balance between meat and vegetables. Oh, and no swimming right after a meal. Haha, I do hope you're not thinking, \"that's too much trouble, I'll just leave it to Noelle,\" are you? ... Oh... but of course, if you are... Well then, just leave it to me.",
            "About Us: Welcome Party\tSo I hear you're an Honorary Knight of Favonius? I envy you! I suppose that makes you my senior... Anyway, it's about time someone threw you a welcome party, surely? Leave it to me!",
            "About the Vision\tTo be honest, I'm feeling a little dejected. Sure, this Vision proves that the Archons think I'm worthy, but why is it a Geo Vision? I mean, Geo's the furthest thing from Anemo, and for a Knight of Favonius...",
            "Something to Share\tI actually really like the smell of wine, I'm just not of drinking age yet. There've been a few times when I could've had a little taste if I'd wanted, and no one would ever have known... but I resisted the temptation. I feel like the first time you try it is probably really magical, so I want to save it till I'm older.",
            "Interesting Things\tA maid is required to keep everyone's secrets. That's why my favorite flower is the rose. Here in Mondstadt, the rose represents the saying, \"As wine bottles are corked, so too my lips are sealed.\" It reminds me to— What? ...Roses represent love in your hometown? I—I had no idea the rose held such a... passionate meaning.",
            "About Amber\tI really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright I think. Oh no, please do not be alarmed. There's no risk of explosion whatsoever.",
            "About Klee\tI've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in solitary confinement...",
            "About Jean\tMaster Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!",
            "About Varka\tAt first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!",
            "About Kaeya\tHe's a mysterious character! He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, \"errand runner\"? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!",
            "About Bennett\tHe's asked me to join the Adventurers' Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius. While I could help him take care of his \"dads\" like the other adventurers... the Knights hold a special meaning for me, and I'm not ready to give up on becoming one yet. No, I simply cannot accept his offer.",
            "About Fischl: Tea\tI think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely... I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.",
            "About Fischl: Background\tSo once when I was cleaning the library, I noticed a book on the shelf called Flowers for Princess Fischl. At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her.",
            "About Barbara\tWe take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with Barbara.",
            "More About Noelle: I\tHow may I be of assistance? ...Oh, you just want to chat? Okay then! Well, if that's how I can help, then please feel free to chat as long as you'd like.",
            "More About Noelle: II\tNot a problem, I'm here to serve in whatever capacity you require. You needn't be concerned about the way I feel. ...Huh? More tool than maid? I disagree! A tool might help you to complete a million tasks to a satisfactory standard, but it feels nothing. I, on the other hand, feel a strong sense of achievement every time I do something for you.",
            "More About Noelle: III\tTh—These treats are for me? Oh no, I couldn't, really. Well... Then I'll make some for you too! I'll go right now, right this instant! Half an hour... Ah, okay, maybe an hour, tops. You can busy yourself with other things first, and I'll be sure to deliver them right to you, hot and fresh out of the oven!",
            "More About Noelle: IV\tI spend all my days handling the most trivial of matters, but so long as it helps you in your adventure, or makes your life easier in some small way, I couldn't be happier. That's because each time I get a thank-you, it makes me feel like my work at least has some meaning, no matter how insignificant it seems.",
            "More About Noelle: V\tEven though I mostly work for the Knights of Favonius, I'm always looking out for ways I can help more people. These days, though, I seem to be spending more and more of my time with you... It might be a bit selfish of me... What do you think?",
            "Noelle's Hobbies\tMy hobby? I really like washing all sorts of things... clothes, floorboards, windows, you name it! Whenever I see something dirty, I just want to give it a good old clean! It gives me such a sense of achievement! ...Oh, you mean the things I do in my free time? Hmm... Same answer!",
            "Noelle's Troubles\tHow to get more for your Mora? Last time I went all the way to Liyue, I visited every single shop to compare prices, and then carried everything back myself... I won't be doing that again though. I was on the road for so long that Jean was convinced I'd been gobbled up by Stormterror along the way!",
            "Favorite Food\tMy favorite is easily a Satisfying Salad. The best of Mondstadt's natural produce on one plate — highly nutritious, and a low calorie count. No, I never get sick of eating it — it's delicious! I've been eating it for ten years now.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI'm not a fussy eater, but I really don't like banquets... The reason being, as the maid, I'm expected to sample every single dish on the table to ensure its quality. Just one bite of each, of course, but it all adds up... Oh, the guilt...",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tHow can you make such a simple dish taste so good? My admiration towards you just keeps growing!",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tThis tastes wonderful! Uh, would you mind teaching me how to make this? After all, it is my duty as a maid...",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tHmm... This is more than I normally eat in a whole day...",
            "Birthday\tSince you're always so busy adventuring, there must be so many little things you never get round to, surely? Well, you need not worry about them adding up, because today, I am all yours — your exclusive maid for the entire day! Just leave it all to me! ...Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you a very happy birthday!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tWhat is this... new power!? Thank you! Now I can be of assistance to even more people.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tI cannot rest on my laurels. After all, I'm not even formally a knight yet. Until that day, I must work even harder.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tThank you for the opportunity to accompany you on your adventures, it's taught me a lot and I believe I have improved a lot. As a maid, I should be the one serving you, but it seems you have done more for me than I could ever imagine...",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tEveryone in Mondstadt is saying that I'm much more reliable now. Some even say that I'm to be made a true knight soon, but I don't think— What? You think so too? Awwww... Thank you! Coming from you, that is the best compliment I could ever hope for!",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tNoelle has much greater dreams and ambitions than other maids in the Knights of Favonius.\nLike anyone else in this city protected by the Knights of Favonius, she too dreams of donning the honored armor.\nEven if her skills are not enough to pass the rigorous selection trials, she still wishes to observe and learn from them every chance she gets.\nAside from her training, she enjoys her current life, helping everyone in need.\n\"You can leave absolutely anything to me!\"\nThat's her signature line. If there's anything that you need, Noelle is glad to be of aid.",
            "Character Story 1\tNoelle is \"the maid of all maids\" to many.\nSuch people also tend to say this of her: \"She's everywhere.\"\nFor example, there was a child who once tried to get a plate during a banquet, but found that there was no way to open the cabinet without all the plates falling out...\n\"Noelle!!!!!!\"\nAll the child needed to do was scream, and Noelle appeared. She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up other plates, and then put them back in order.\nNoelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.\nHowever, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter.\n\"No more, no less. As it should be, not as it should not be.\"\nNoelle doesn't think there's anything special about her — she's just a little more conscientious, that's all.",
            "Character Story 2\tNoelle is always eager to help, sometimes excessively so.\nIf you were to ask her how to build a campfire as she passed by, she would not only stop and build the campfire for you, she would also put up the grill racks, season the food, cook it for you, taste it herself to make sure it's done, and remind you to put out the fire when you've finished so as not to burn the forest down. Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.\nOf course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...\nFor example, a merchant from Snezhnaya once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.\nHe disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.\nInitially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.\nNoelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.\nThis spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?\nIn the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.\nNoelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously.",
            "Character Story 3\tMost of the time, Noelle's reliability provides a comforting presence, but there are always exceptions.\nOnce, she learned that an adventurer was trapped on Dragonspine, so she decided to mount a rescue by herself.\nThe snowstorm that day was terribly fierce, wiping out any tracks left by humans as soon as they were made. It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.\nHowever, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.\nAt the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.\nThe adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.\nIt was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.\nIn order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day.\nDuring the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few \"urgent matters\" for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over.",
            "Character Story 4\tNoelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength.\nThis does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength.\nOnce, Lisa accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand — and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.\nThere was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue — hurling the carts — cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.\nRumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion.\nIn all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.\nAt first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.\nPutting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.\nBut don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.\nThey say, however, that the very day Noelle received her custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb...\nLet's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky.",
            "Character Story 5\tNoelle's greatest enemy, curiously, is not a person, but Ludi Harpastum itself.\nDuring Ludi Harpastum, long tables arranged in a circular shape and filled with all kinds of food will be set up in the plaza before the Cathedral for everyone to enjoy.\nThe food is usually prepared by volunteers who can cook. During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.\nIt's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.\nThe crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering Pile 'Em Ups — all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.\nThe smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh.\nFor the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol.\nThe festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning.",
            "\"Warning of Roses\"\tThe maids of the Knights have many \"red lines\" that are not to be crossed, and one of these is that \"the personal information of the Knights must be kept in strict confidence.\"\nThis does not only require restricting outsider access to such information — this restriction also applies to other members of the Knights.\nFor example, what Jean keeps in her private quarters, the contents of Amber's Baron Bunny, the number of special eye patches that Kaeya owns, the number of Klee's hidden bomb caches... These things are all top secret.\nTo avoid leaking such information, Noelle used red cloth to make a great many roses — in Mondstadt, this flower means \"my lips are sealed.\"\nShe specially wove one such rose into her gauntlet as an ever-present reminder to herself.\nRevealing secrets would be a major dereliction of duty for a maid, and those who aspire to be knights cannot afford such errors.\nSo you can forget about probing Noelle for any secrets. She won't tell.",
            "Vision\tNoelle did once wish to fulfill her dream before its time. Some years ago, after failing her seventh selection test, which was really a foregone conclusion, she felt somewhat discouraged.\nThe etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?\nShe had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.\nAt that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.\nWithout a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.\nImmediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.\nBut just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.\nAfter a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.\nThis was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.\nHer hard work had been remembered after all.\nFrom that day forward, Vision in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable — and yes, everywhere at once too."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tDue to being a zombie, Qiqi lacks facial expression. She hopes that's okay.\nShe may look like a zombie, but she's surprisingly limber due to a strict calisthenics regimen.\nHer memory is poor. She forgets easily, and that is partly why she can seem cold to others.\nHer appearance is forever frozen at the point of her passing, so estimates of her age are unreliable.\nZombies require orders to act, but due to some reason or another, Qiqi is presently giving herself orders.",
            "Character Story 1\tUsually, zombies are cold and stiff, which forces them to locomote by hopping about.\nAs such, Qiqi keeps up a calisthenics regimen to retain a human-like form.\nThe 77th-generation Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, Hu Tao, doesn't see the point of all this. Whenever she meets Qiqi, she will say: \"It would be easier if you just let me bury you.\"\nQiqi, of course, has no wish to be buried, and so conducts her exercises at night when no one's about.\nQiqi's memory falls far behind those of non-undead disposition.\nIf she does not continue to reinforce her impressions of someone, she will completely forget them in three days tops.\nBut who knows, this might be a good thing — for a person with painful memories, forgetting may, in fact, be a form of release.\nThe person Qiqi must remember most... not only does this person have a very punch-able face, but she also shows up every single day.\nAs such, Qiqi isn't too concerned about her poor memory.",
            "Character Story 2\tQiqi is very petite indeed, but is in fact a very powerful zombie. Her short stature is hardly any impediment, but is instead good for high-speed movement.\nIn combat, Qiqi will unleash the self-control that she usually maintains, allowing her body to return to an undead state, increasing her strength and speed.\n\"You're dead.\"\nOnce she has stoically defeated her enemies, Qiqi will once again get her muscles under control, returning to her normal state.\nShe has been threatened in the past by Treasure Hoarders while picking herbs by herself.\nNow, a little girl, all by herself, seems like an easy target, no?\nWho would have thought that this girl could send a whole crew flying?\nThis is why we should always remember never to judge a person based on appearances. Or a zombie, for that matter.",
            "Character Story 3\tZombies mostly require orders from the person who awakens them to move. But strictly speaking, Qiqi has never been awakened.\nAs such, she counts as a very rare case of a zombie that gives itself orders.\nIf these orders are simple ones like \"defeat the enemy,\" Qiqi has no problem fulfilling them.\nBut when faced with complex instructions such as \"go to Jueyun Karst, climb the sheer rock faces and pick herbs,\" Qiqi sometimes winds up stuck below the cliffs, unable to give up no matter how many times she tries and fails to scale the cliff.\nThe method to cancel her orders is very simple — hug Qiqi from behind, tell her something like \"I love you the most,\" and the orders will dissipate, just like that.\nUnfortunately, there's just no element of sincerity when Baizhu does it, leading to greatly reduced results.\nPerhaps someday, someone will come along who understands that such words cannot be spoken lightly, and who slowly but carefully releases the hold that Qiqi's orders have over her...\nWhat will Qiqi's response be then?",
            "Character Story 4\tThis ancient story has long been forgotten by mortals.\nAn ordinary herb-picking lass named Qiqi lost her way and trespassed the realm of the adepti. Injuring her right leg in a fall, she hurriedly hid in a cavern to rest.\nEven occupied as she was in bandaging her wound, she could hear sounds that did not belong to the mortal plane. But she could have never expected that with a huge crash, she would forever be trapped between life and death.\nWhether adepti or demons, just or wicked, all understood that she was an innocent mortal caught in the crossfire.\nOr perhaps it was by the will of heaven that she received a Vision in her dying moments, and so ended this contention between adepti and demon.\nThe adepti could not bear to let her die, and each imparted to her a portion of their strength, meaning to breathe life back into her body.\nQiqi did indeed awaken and live again, but went into a berserk state, unable to control the adepti energy raging through her.\nSeeking to end the disturbance, Mountain Shaper had no choice but to seal the hapless maiden in amber.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter hundreds of years, Qiqi was discovered by humans, still trapped in the amber, and was brought to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for burial.\nThe mountain roads were treacherous, however, and the amber was bumped about. Coupled with the passing of many years, the seal on Qiqi was all but spent.\nShe awakened in the middle of the night, broke the amber in secret, and fled.\nFollowing the herb-picking habits of her previous life, Qiqi headed right for the hills.\nBy chance, she met Baizhu, the boss of Bubu Pharmacy, on the way, and he took her in.\nNow, Baizhu was a doctor of great skill, but he was hardly a man of high caliber or great courage.\nEven so, he took her in, never mind that her memory was so poor that she could not even sort herbs out.\nIt does seem that his acceptance of Qiqi has something to do with his own personal pursuits.\nQiqi is stiff, but not slow, and has long realized this. However, she does not take it to heart.\nPerhaps she has seen too much, or been alone for too long... But what remains true is that she treasures his concern, even if there is some other motive behind it.",
            "A Home-and-Away Handbook of Practical Wisdom for the Undead\tQiqi carries something with her that looks like a notebook.\nQiqi's memory is very poor, so it is an object of irreplaceable importance if she is to smoothly go about her daily life.\nThe words within are written in a centuries-old style, and are very elegant indeed.\nThe first page is an instructional on calisthenics.\nMoving past that, one finds the descriptions of various herbs and some \"orders.\"\nQiqi needs to give herself orders, so she has very precise instructions to ensure smooth transition.\nShe has also dutifully written down all the things she needs to do in a day.\nRecently, she has also added a section on \"brain training\" and \"mnemonic methods.\"\nAt this point, it has become a true \"dummy's guide\" on just about anything.\nBut if the day ever comes when Qiqi also forgets to look at her notebook... there would truly be nothing for it then.",
            "Vision\tQiqi's Vision was given to her in the last moment of her life.\nShe wanted to stop the clock from turning. She wanted to live happily again.\nShe feared death. She wanted to live. She missed her family... These feelings coalesced at last into \"ice.\"\n\"If only I could freeze time... How wonderful would that be?\"\nAs she thought thus, tears fell from the moribund girl's eyes upon the Vision that had appeared before her.\nThe mighty and illuminated adepti all acknowledged this as a legitimate form of \"illumination\" — the yearning of humanity for bygone days is, after all, a desire to protect that past."

            "Character Details\tSince the dawn of life, humankind has always borne an intense yearning for and curiosity about the world. This is the anchor point of their cognition and is the foundation of all reason.\nThe world of the people of Inazuma is also thus. There, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain were primordial facts of life, as well as light, and the sea... and the Raiden Shogun.\nBabes nestling in their mothers' arms hear tales of the Shogun's slaying of many gods and conquering of other races.\nWhen young men and women roam the islands, they see the gorge split asunder by a blade of lightning and the pale, still-standing bones of the giant snake.\nSoldiers take to the battlefield with \"glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!\" upon their lips.\nThe people work in contentment and peace, knowing that the Shogun and her loyal Tri-Commission are there.\nThe great name of the Raiden Shogun has long shaken off the shackles of mere life, becoming the eternal traditional belief of Inazuma.\nPeople trust in this great name and its might, believing that their descendants shall witness the same sights, that the same faith will form the foundations of their inner worlds, and that this will pass on from generation to generation.\nThis is the eternal paradise that the Almighty Shogun promised her people.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe true name of the Raiden Shogun is \"Raiden Ei.\"\nIn her long road, she has witnessed the price that Inazuma has had to pay for progress over the hundreds and thousands of years.\nThe happiest years of her life had passed her by, and those she once considered friends became her foes. In the end, she even lost the reason for which she had wielded her sword.\n\"Where there is progress, there must be loss.\"\nEi believed that this was the iron-clad rule of the world, with time as its merciless enforcer.\nThe greatest and most prosperous nation of men collapsed overnight, and even that most ancient Liyue Harbor would say farewell to its Geo Archon. The winds of parting came whistling in from the outer edge of time.\nHowever resounding the Raiden Shogun's name, centuries later, millennia later... Someday, Inazuma would lose the protection of its deity.\nAs a warrior, she was wary of all foes. Even if that enemy was a crisis as intangible as time's passage, she had to find a countermeasure, a weapon she could use to defeat it in time.\nHer answer? \"Eternity.\" Only Eternity could freeze all things under the sky, make Inazuma truly deathless.\n\"Then, while things are still good, let us have stillness... Let us march towards Eternity.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tFor beings with a perishable form of flesh to pursue Eternity, they must first solve the unavoidable problem of lifespan.\nThis limited time troubled Ei greatly, until one day when a mysterious technique came before her eyes as if by a stroke of fate.\nUsing such techniques, one could create intricate puppets indistinguishable from true life.\nIn theory, this puppet could perfectly imitate everything about Ei. It could surpass the limits of her lifespan and defend Inazuma forever. Yet, how could creating a copy of an Archon be a simple affair?\nEi conducted countless experiments to this effect, discarded a great many failed products, and spent an unimaginable amount of time and resources—\nBut at last, by her dogged pursuit and warrior's spirit, she was able to create a flawless puppet.\nThe newborn Raiden Shogun sat there silently, listening to Ei speak all about her, \"her,\" and even about them. The future of Inazuma was here, inscribed upon a gorgeous blueprint.\nThe automaton had but one question to ask Ei: \"There is no turning back from forsaking your form. Do you regret nothing?\"\n\"Your existence is my answer.\"\nThen, Ei transferred her consciousness into her blade, and thus was born the Plane of Euthymia.",
            "Character Story 3\tBefore Raiden Ei became the Shogun, she was a samurai responsible for seeing that the previous Shogun's orders were carried out.\nThe previous Electro Archon, Raiden Makoto, was no great fighter, and the things Ei had charge over were mostly matters of warfare and slaughter. However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.\nDue to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the Kitsune Saiguu reserved for the winners.\nThus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or Mikoshi Chiyo for karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.\nAt last, the day came that under a sakura tree's shade, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty tengu would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.\nEi let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade.\n Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.\nAs for the Kitsune Saiguu, oh, how amused she looked as she presented Ei with some pastries.\n\"I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content.\"\nEi was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.\n—But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely — just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.\nTo this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree.\n...Even though she has not gone to see it in a long time, and even though no one sits under it anymore, she wishes that time might stop forever.",
            "Character Story 4\tEi still remembers the way in which Makoto greatly loved the scenery of Inazuma, its cuisine, and the stories of its people — and how she loved telling Ei all about them.\nThough they both understood the concept of erosion well, Makoto was unlike Ei, who worried about the future more often. Instead, Makoto's energies were focused on the present.\n\"It is precisely because we know that this scene is but a fleeting shadow that we should enjoy it all the more.\"\nThen, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun. She thought to herself that she must learn to be more leisurely, just like Makoto.\nYet the times changed all too quickly, all but catching Ei off guard. Before she knew it, her hands already held the blade that the dying Raiden Makoto had passed on to her.\nThis day, the kagemusha was now the true Raiden Shogun.\nAnd it was on this day that Ei truly felt the agony of erosion.\nAs time marched forward inexorably, even this blade, this sakura... All life on Inazuma would fade before her eyes.\nThis was the foundation of Inazuma, and it was the thing that the Raiden Shogun must defend.\n\"If you look at it this way, thinking ahead is not meaningless, nor is it vain arrogance.\"\nHaving resolved herself, her life exceeded its mortal shell, and eternity descended upon the mortal plane.",
            "Character Story 5\tOne night, Raiden Ei entered a beautiful dreamscape while meditating.\nHere, there was nothing left between heaven and earth but her, and a \"her\" that was akin to looking into a mirror.\nThe automaton's voice flowed into her ears like a sigh: \"the eternity you resolved to establish in your heart has been shaken by the countless wishes of the people. Thus, you have become my enemy.\"\nBack when she was creating the puppet, Ei had considered all the hidden risks involved.\nShe believed that anything was possible — including the worst-case scenario... in which she too would someday become a threat to Eternity.\nBut she had to press on. She had to reach Eternity. This, she would not permit to be stayed by any outside force.\nThe puppet's words were something that she had asked herself long ago:\n\"You believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. Thus, you believe your present self is correct. Don't you?\"\n\"But have you really been enlightened with new ideas? Or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?\"\nTheir faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. The battle with herself, with her past, would come someday.\nBut it was not this day. Ei knew well that she was not yet ready.\nHer heart had been clear, and she would have remained in that state, but hearing the cries of her people, she had to command her feet to stop.\nThe sky above the mirror was no longer empty, and all about the silent halls, she heard the cry of crows. Dawn was coming. The samurai must take up her sword.\nThis dream was ever so real, and it, too, passed like a shadow.",
            "Musou Isshin\tA sword that, once passed on, has accompanied Ei to this day.\nThis sword has had two wielders, and has witnessed both time and eternity.\nIt was born from Raiden Makoto's divine might, but it was never once sharpened. It took after its owner, of course, for Makoto was not one for battle. It was but a symbol, a sign of true peace.\nThe day Makoto passed on, it was given into Ei's hands. The sword was stained with blood, then, and as the blade drew its first taste of crimson, the dripping ichor was blown aside by wild winds and blazing thunder.\nMakoto gave it the name Musou Isshin, and desired to have it witness an Inazuma as lovely as a dream and the noble hearts that dwell in this world.\nEi did not change its name. For she, too, had looked out over that vast scene of beauty, and the sight of it had engendered a stronger, purer dream in her own heart.\nThe aesthetic of lightning is precisely to capture that which is precious amidst fleeting transience.",
            "Gnosis\tBefore she came to dwell in the Plane of Euthymia permanently, Ei was troubled for a time concerning where she might store her Gnosis.\nShe no longer had any need of it, but such an important item could not simply be placed anywhere. She had initially intended to have it modified into a energy supply device, but no matter what she did, her techniques had no effect on the Gnosis at all.\nAnd that was when she thought of someone: the cunning and clever Yae Miko. She was not precisely someone to be trusted, but she was in many ways also Ei's best choice.\nUpon hearing this request, Miko could not help but joke: \"Aren't you afraid that I might just sell this off?\"\n\"You understand the value of a Gnosis. Even if you sold it, I trust that you would have exchanged it for something of equal value, and that is no easy price to pay.\"\nWith someone of Yae Miko's character, it would be no surprise if she ever sold the Gnosis, yes, but she would not allow herself to lose out in any such exchange.\nSuch, then, was the tacit agreement between the two old friends. Yae Miko understood Ei's intent and took the precious Gnosis with a smile.\n\"Well, this is your idea, not mine. Don't end up regretting this, now.\""

            "Character Details\tRazor is a boy whose identity is shrouded in mystery. He lives in Wolvendom and is rarely spotted by the citizens of Mondstadt.\nAccording to a handful of eyewitness accounts, Razor has keen senses and is highly agile, traversing the forest at breakneck speed. He is often seen in the company of his wolf pack, while generally avoiding contact with humans.\nSome speculate that he was an orphan raised by the wolves, while others say he is a wolf spirit that has taken on a human form.\nSuch rumors only add to the mystery of the \"Wolf Boy,\" as the denizens of Mondstadt call him.\nMeanwhile, Razor the Wolf Boy stands all the while on the hilltops with his head held high, basking in the warm sunlight.",
            "Character Story 1\tRazor lives among the wolves night and day.\nAll of them are as close with Razor as they could possibly be. Which wolf has the loudest howl, which wolf runs the fastest, which wolf is the best at ambushing — there isn't a wolf Razor doesn't know.\nHe can sense the mood of the wind, smell a scent from miles away, and knows many practical applications for plants of all kinds. The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.\nWhat kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.\nHis memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun. The wolves took him in as part of their \"Lupical\" — a word he was taught by someone else, which means family.",
            "Character Story 2\tTiny singing things are flying in the sky.\nThe clouds are long and fluffy, like a wolf's tail.\nRazor's world is a simple one.\nOn a sunny day, you run around hunting or try and beat your prey to the ripe fruits. On a rainy day, you hide out in a hollow tree and fall asleep hugging a furry lupine friend, with some grass and leaves for a pillow.\nEat as much as you can and drink plenty of water. Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.\nRazor looks at his body and then at the bodies of his kin.\nHe knows he is different from them.\nBut there's nothing wrong with that, as far as Razor is concerned.",
            "Character Story 3\tOne day, a tall man came to the mountains and disrupted Razor's peaceful life.\nRazor did not know who the man was, only that he was a human. Seeing the confused look on Razor's face, the man gave him a friendly smile.\n\"Hey buddy! Why don't you come back down to Mondstadt with me?\"\nThe man offered his hand to Razor as he spoke.\nBut neither Razor nor the wolves understood the gesture. Feeling protective, the wolves placed themselves between Razor and the man to keep him away.\nRazor ducked down beneath the wolves' furry tails. He looked at his body, and then peered out through the gaps in the wolf fur to get a look at the man's.\nRazor knew he wasn't the most intelligent of beings, and was at a loss to answer the question that has been in his mind ever since that day.\n\"Am I a human, or a wolf?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tIt was that man who gave Razor his name.\nThe simple Wolf Boy could not understand the intricacies of human language, but he knew from the look on the man's face when he produced this sound that the man was giving him a name.\n\"Rae-zer.\"\nThe shadows cast by the trees of Wolvendom grew short, and then grew long again.\nThe man taught Razor how to swing a sword. Unwieldy though this steel claw may be, thought Razor, it was at least sharp enough to cut through tree branches.\n\"Now you can protect your friends.\"\n\"Fr-ren-dzz...\"\nRazor imitated the sounds the man made, without understanding what they meant.\nSimilarly, he did not understand why the names of things were all that important in the first place. After all, he never learned the name of that man before he left.",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Master, what is... 'friends'?\"\nRazor once asked of his new mentor, working at the limits of his vocabulary.\nHis purple-clothed mentor seemed to know it all, from how to make hash browns from potatoes in the ground, to the name of the brightest star in the summer night sky.\nHowever, Lisa simply smiled and yawned without answering him.\nRazor thought about it when the wind blew, when the rain fell — even when Wolfhook berries got stuck in his fur. He just couldn't figure it out.\nUntil one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.\nThey stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together — she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.\nHer name was Klee. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again.\n\"Friends... is... Lupical.\"\nRazor may not understand the complexity of human relationships, but he has an honest, primal loyalty to him.\n\"So... protect friends... Lupical... with life.\"\nThe wolf pack howls in the distance, summoning him home.\nRazor still does not know if he is a human or a wolf.\nBut he is happy either way.",
            "Razor's Crude Wooden Crate\tIn a box so crudely made that one has to be extra careful when opening it lies Razor's greatest treasures.\nThe broken-off hilt of a greatsword, a children's storybook called The Wolf and the Windwheel Aster, and a dry, withered four-leaf clover.\nThough he understands neither the intricacies of human relations nor the ways of the world, Razor knows that these are gifts from the ones known as 'friends' — and that is what makes them his most treasured possessions of all.",
            "Vision\tThe story of how Razor got his Vision is one of the few memories that he wishes he could forget.\nOne day, during a lightning storm, an Abyss Mage ambushed Razor from behind and dragged him away. The wolf pack ran to his aid and put up a fearless fight, but every last one of them was defeated by the Abyss Mage.\nAs he looked on helplessly at his dear companions being harmed, Razor let out an almighty roar like that of a cornered animal.\n\"Lupical!\"\nFueled by his almighty fury, a lightning-like power grew inside, and suddenly an overload of elemental energy was flowing within him.\nHe was ready to protect. He was ready to avenge.\nHe threw off his shackles and raised his weapon.\nThe Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by a wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions.\n...\nThough he had obtained a Vision, Razor was still unable to manipulate Electro energy with finesse. One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge.\n\"Friends, hurt... Never again! I will... protect them.\"\nWith each day, Razor grew more skilled in the use of his Vision. He made a silent promise to himself: \"I will become stronger. I will become the strongest of them all.\"\nBecause the day may come when his Lupical faces another threat, and this time, he will protect them."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tRosaria is one of the sisters of Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.\nThough she is just as much a woman of the cloth as the likes of Barbara and Jilliana, people tend to make a mental distinction between Rosaria and other members of the clergy.\nWhile she might dress the part — at least, to a certain extent — her speech and actions do not reflect her office in the slightest.\nFurthermore, she displays even less reverence towards the gods than the ordinary citizens, and she routinely skips her various church engagements.\nShe comes, goes, and acts in solitude, and if she were ever to make an appearance in the Cathedral, it would be to smoke in the rearmost pew.\nSuch a lone wolf is Rosaria that perhaps she should be considered a clergywoman in name only.",
            "Character Story 1\tIf Rosaria has been lectured once, she has been lectured a thousand times before concerning her unorthodox behavior.\nFor some reason, however, she has never faced any serious consequences for her transgressions. She does not work together with her church colleagues and only rarely shows up to celebratory events in the city.\nThe strange and mysterious Rosaria moves about almost like a wisp of black smoke — blink, and you'll miss her as she disappears into thin air.\nHer social interactions are never more than superficial, and the rest of the time she keeps herself to herself.\nHowever, Sister Victoria would say that the ever good-natured Barbara is one person who has always made the effort to get close to Rosaria.\n\"Please don't smoke in the Cathedral...\" \"Could you try to attend the ceremony on time next time...?\"\n\"And... Hey, come back, I'm still talking to you!\"\nBarbara is forever anxiously chasing after Rosaria, urging her to complete her various daily tasks.\nYet even when faced with Barbara, the beloved idol of Mondstadt, Rosaria remains completely unmoved.\nSurely her heart can't be completely made of stone?",
            "Character Story 2\tRosaria's movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone and can be gone for up to several days on end.\nDuring these times, none of her church colleagues know where to find her.\nOne of the sisters who took it upon herself to observe Rosaria once groused that \"even a stray cat should at least give you notice before running off...\"\nRosaria uses these disappearances to do work that only she can do in corners unseen by others.\nAn unfamiliar merchant, a suspicious traveler — are these people threats to Mondstadt?\nShe investigates, shadows, and if necessary, interrogates.\nIf they must disappear, then Rosaria shall be the last person they meet.\nSuch dark work, which cannot see the light of day, is to be done by her hand alone.\nShe always sets out after the sun has set, finishing her work in one fell swoop. Sometimes, if she makes it back by the crack of dawn, she gets to usher in the day ahead with a glass of breakfast wine.\nThe people of Mondstadt live in the golden sunlight, but Rosaria dwells under the silver moonlight.\nIt is a cold, piercing light... just like that of the ice she forms with her Cryo abilities.\n\"There are some things that young people need not know,\" Rosaria thinks.\nThough, in her eyes, \"young people\" means all citizens of Mondstadt who live in the light of the sun, regardless of their age.",
            "Character Story 3\tLike a puff of smoke, the lackadaisical Rosaria is impossible to pin down.\nNevertheless, once she takes on a job, she can be relied on to handle it with the utmost professionalism.\n\"Lazy\" is the last word that anyone would use to describe her ruthless interrogations of suspicious individuals.\nShe also possesses exceptional strength and knows the weaknesses of the human body like the back of her hand — and has no reservations about using this knowledge to kill.\nPeople know her as the lazy, chain-smoking sister, but behind the scenes, she is a formidable purveyor of justice.\nA strange fate for one who ostensibly basks in the light of the gods.\nWhat led her to become a blood-soaked slayer? Why does she stay silent while others praise the gods for their protection?\nPerhaps it should come as no surprise that Rosaria was not born and bred in Mondstadt.\n\"A city that is fortunate enough to be boring always needs someone to do the dirty work...\"\nRosaria stubs her cigarette out as she speaks in her characteristically languid manner.\n\"And as far as I'm concerned, the things I deal with are far simpler than living the life of a traditional sister.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tRosaria may not be one to attend prayer meetings, but that does not mean she doesn't have her own theological viewpoints.\nIn her view, freedom is the spiritual pillar of Mondstadt's people, and it is the very thing that caused her to end up here in the first place.\nRosaria was born in a remote mountain village, but was taken from her home shortly after birth by the very same bandits who drenched it in blood.\nRaised by those crooks, she learned how to fight, sometimes thieving, other times doing odd jobs for the crew.\nShe was their servant, but also their tool, a crook, yet still a child.\nShe fought against outsiders and her comrades alike, and growing up was a constant battle for survival against the hunger and cold.\nRosaria's youth was just like Mondstadt's sunset — blood-red from horizon to horizon, and so fleeting that night had fallen before she'd had the chance to stop and take in the view.\nUltimately, the bandit crew was wiped out by the Knights of Favonius. As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.\nGrand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:\n\"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life.\"\nBut Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.\nShe would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.\nFor Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness.",
            "Character Story 5\tRosaria, the Church's number one truant, became infamous for her absence very early on.\n\"Miss Rosaria, please, show a little more circumspection in your actions! You are a member of the Church. How is it appropriate that you simply never turn up for hymn practice?\"\n\"Please calm down, Sister Ophila. Miss Rosaria, I'm told that you have never attended a single one of your compulsory classes. Is that so?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Mother Maria, please look at this... Rosaria's theological essay is an utter mess!\"\n\"Miss Rosaria, if I may ask frankly... do you intend to do any work at all here at the Church?\"\n\"No. I've already found other work.\"\nRosaria never showed so much as a hint of anxiety in any of these exchanges. What's more, it was true — she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.\nThe unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.\nRosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.\nNevertheless, when she's not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.\nAnd when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.\nThe instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.\nWhether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime.",
            "Church-Issue Journal\tA journal with a white cover. The words \"Church of Favonius\" are inscribed on the cover.\nThe handwriting is beautiful, but the content is the most of the most banal variety imaginable.\n\"Dandelion Wine — now eighty percent off!\"\n\"Fisherman's Toast — an incredible flavor at an unbelievable price!\"\n\"Crazy discounts on Wheat — ask at the counter and we'll grind it into Flour for you.\"\n\"Buy three Tomatoes and get one free!\"\n\"Fresh Small Lamp Grass! Use it to light up your bathroom! Come on, Sir, have a look!\"\nThere is something incongruous about a random assortment of marketplace cries and advertising slogans having been penned by such a graceful and elegant hand.\nThis journal is a relic from Rosaria's novice days.\nClearly, she must have skipped class and headed to the rooftops on the merchant street, bathing in the sun, listening to the eclectic cries of the street vendors, and committing them to paper.",
            "Vision\tRosaria's Vision came to her on a particularly frigid night.\nThings were getting desperate for the bandit gang — people were starving and the food supplies were dwindling.\nNever able to eat her fill, Rosaria was driven by hunger to flee into the freezing wind rather than continue another second with the hard labor she was forced to endure.\nOne of the elders of the gang pursued her and brought her back.\nHe was the very person who had taken her from the village of her birth, and the one who had taught her how to kill.\n\"Fleeing makes you a traitor, and traitors can only earn their freedom through victory in combat.\"\nThe old bandit tossed Rosaria an old dagger.\n\"Well, come on then! Kill me, and you can leave this place. I'm long in the tooth now, while you've got youth on your side. You can do this, can't ya?\"\nNo one thought that she would be able to kill him — and yet, the old lion would indeed fall by the newborn cub's claws.\nThus did the bandits lose an old member and welcome a new one that very night.\nThe bandits were reluctant to accept Rosaria at first since she had slain one of their own, but they quickly had a change of heart after seeing the Vision in her hand.\nSurely, a Vision wielder had to be far stronger than some old coot who was about to kick the bucket right? And she ate less, to boot... They could save some food this way.\nMeanwhile, a question crept into Rosaria's frozen heart:\nDid he let me replace him on purpose? ...Could a false father have harbored genuine affection for a child he stole so arbitrarily?"

Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed \"detective\" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs.

            "Sangonomiya Kokomi's Troubles\tTo be quite honest, I'm not particularly skilled at communicating with others. Putting on my \"Divine Priestess airs\" certainly makes things easier, but once I run out of energy, I start to get a bit negative. I prevent others from seeing that side of me at all costs.

            "Character Details\tThe inhabitants of Watatsumi Island once lived in Enkanomiya, at the bottom of the sea.\nIt was only by the grace of the god Orobaxi bringing them up to the surface that the civilization of Watatsumi Island exists today.\nWhen Orobaxi was slain by the Electro Archon, its body was left as a skeleton and its resentment permeated the land, giving rise to Tatarigami.\nYet its desire to protect Watatsumi Island never faded. This will lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan, and follows them from generation to generation.\nThe current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess.\nThe meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe day Kokomi ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, countless inhabitants of Watatsumi Island came to Sangonomiya Shrine of their own accord to see her.\nSurprise, suspicion, confusion, chuckles... Their expressions were strange, all on account of her overly-young appearance in their eyes.\nPlots were hatched and questions were endless. The ambitious planned to make their move. The storm was approaching, and all was not at peace on Watatsumi Island.\nYet all went back to business as usual not long after Kokomi ascended to her position.\nShe was fair in distributing rewards and punishments alike, appreciated the contributions of the people, and was militarily skilled. Her many abilities quickly won the hearts of most of the people.\n\"Things will be alright as long as Her Excellency is here\" soon became the most widespread saying on the island.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere are many factors involved in deciding victory or defeat.\nTerrain, weather, differences in military strength and equipment quality... All of these require careful consideration.\nThose who study the details too closely tend to miss changes on the field, and most who speak of strategy speak of it in a vacuum.\nOnly those who can grasp both the big picture and the small details can create miracles on the battlefield.\nAnd behind all this lies countless hours of hard work delving into the reasons behind one's failures.\nFew if any ever persevere to the end, but Kokomi was not only good at this but also possessed a unique tactical style.\n\"Manipulate the larger strategic situation to force the other side to give up, and to win wars with the least amount of cost possible.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tWhether on the battlefield or off it, Kokomi tries to \"know thy enemy\" as much as possible.\nShe tends to predict all possible scenarios beforehand and devise strategies to address them, which are then delivered as directives to those who enforce her will.\nThis has given rise to the issue of some of these directives being rather thick and heavy, but this method has guaranteed the stable development of Watatsumi Island.\nToday, Watatsumi Island moves each day towards greater prosperity, and as more talented people have been appointed to office, the directives that Kokomi has to deliver have decreased.\nAs far as she is concerned, that is something worth celebrating.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen Kokomi has the time to spare, she will go on walks on Watatsumi Island alone.\nShe often tries to avoid crowds, pacing slowly through the violet forests, sometimes sitting by the seaside and looking out into the distance.\nThe sun and the moon rise over the sea, the stars shine in their skies, and the sound of the waves is pleasing to the ear, relaxing the soul.\nSometimes she will even place a seashell on her head, only to put it back where she found it when she leaves.\nIn her mind, perhaps some wandering crab will burrow its way inside and call this shell home.\nSometimes, Kokomi will also go diving, enjoying the calm atmosphere by herself, her worries sinking into the ocean depths as schools of fish swim all around her.\nKokomi treasures every sight there is to be seen on Watatsumi Island, and she remembers the name of every person.\nSadly, while scenery remains, people's hearts are complex and changeable.\nVictory is simple enough to attain compared to the mammoth task of making sure that everyone lives happily.\nThis dilemma has always troubled her.",
            "Character Story 5\tKokomi has been well-read since she was young, and has a particular love for military treatises.\nAs such, Kokomi has a broad store of knowledge to be used in every field.\nBut another result of her constantly being buried in such treatises of war and illustrated military texts is that Kokomi lacks skill in social interaction. She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.\nHaving ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.\nHowever, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.\nAs such, Kokomi set up an \"energy\" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.\nWhen she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.\nEngrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world — thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.\nThese moments are of utmost value to her.",
            "Secret Notes\t\"As the ruler is, so shall the people be.\"\nThis precept was something Kokomi heard from her mother a long time ago.\nThe Divine Priestess' role is one of utmost importance to Watatsumi Island, and its people's eyes are always upon her every move.\nThe things she loves will be in fashion, and the things she dislikes, the people will also distance themselves from.\nKokomi, in truth, has no wish to affect the people's lives, and as such has rarely ever revealed much of her personal likes or dislikes.\nShe treats all things with an egalitarian manner, and holds \"fairness of judgment\" and \"justice in dispensing rewards and punishment\" to be her guiding principles.\nHowever, these are not necessarily her true feelings, and so she prepared a book of secret notes for herself.\nHere, she records the fluctuations in both her energy levels and mood.\nWhen the night deepens and the world falls silent, Kokomi will open this book and write the day's experiences, whether they be joyous, sad, or frustrating.\n...Of course, this object is for her eyes only — and so it must remain.",
            "Vision\tA leader with a strong will can lead those around them in a clear direction.\nHowever, Kokomi lacks such strong ideals. Instead, she respects the will of the people and wishes that they can each find their own way.\nJust as the vast ocean can accommodate countless souls and their individual desires, so does Kokomi wish her rule could be.\nWhen the Vision Hunt Decree came about, the resentment of the people turned into cries of revolt, and so Kokomi led them in raising the banner of resistance.\nAnd once the war was over, the hearts of the people turned towards peace and stability, and so did Kokomi direct her energies towards governance and economics.\nBut what was the source of this toil? Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?\nAs the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision. And ever since the day she looked out at the sea outside Sangonomiya Shrine, her wish has never once changed—\n\"I wish to protect all of Watatsumi Island and allow its people to lead happy lives.\""

            "Character Details\tMost Inazumans are unaware of the existence of the Shuumatsuban. In fact, the Shuumatsuban is a secret organization under the Yashiro Commission.\nThere is also a little ninja who goes by the name of Sayu in the Shuumatsuban, and this fact is even less known.\nSayu is a special existence in the Shuumatsuban. She has been raised in the Shuumatsuban since she was a child, and is extremely loyal to the organization.\nThat said, her most prominent trait is not \"loyalty,\" but \"laziness.\"\nLazing around is what Sayu does best. She has long mastered the various arts of ninjutsu, particularly those that help her to slack off or shirk her duties, such as escape techniques and aura concealment.\nPeople who don't know about her habits will have to make a lot of effort to find her.\nHowever, if you ask Sayu about her slacking, she will shrug and reply, \"It's not that I'm lazy, I just want to spend my time on more meaningful things.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tSayu is petite and can even be described as delicate.\nThis is also something that bothers her —\nOne by one, her peers are growing taller, but she still has the stature of a child, as her height has not changed at all.\nSayu is really anxious about this matter.\nDay by day, the world seems to be sprouting skyward, and only she remains small as ever.\nGrowing taller has gradually become an obsession in Sayu's mind.\n\"As long as I sleep long enough, I can definitely grow taller!\"\nShe came to believe this ever so firmly, seizing every opportunity to sleep as much as possible, creating every opportunity and circumstance, even when there were none.\nPeople around little Sayu often let her be, as they don't have the heart to disturb her sleep.\nSo now, the situation has progressed such that Sayu is able to fall asleep, even whilst standing.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe ninjutsu that Sayu has learned is not very powerful in combat, but it is quite useful in the matter of slacking off.\nShe is extremely skilled at hiding and covering her tracks, and is an expert in this area. Therefore, if she has the intention to hide, ordinary people absolutely cannot find her.\nHowever, even the most ingenious puzzles have answers, and even the most elusive treasures have clues for people to find them. This also holds true for Sayu.\nAfter spending enough time with Sayu, one will understand her habits and preferences. Trying to find her doesn't seem so difficult anymore.\nFor example, if you go to Sayu's room early in the morning and lift the covers, the odds are that you will find her in bed.\nAt noon, you can check out the trees near the shrine and who knows, you may find something unexpected.\nIt will be more challenging to find Sayu at night, but it's a good idea to go to her house and wait for her to emerge.\nHowever, please remember not to disturb Sayu, who is busy growing taller, unless it is absolutely necessary.\nEven gentle rabbits bite when provoked, let alone Sayu...",

If Sayu used her ninjutsu to work hard, she would have had great accomplishments in the Shuumatsuban.",
            "Character Story 4\tSayu is the last successor to the Ninjutsu Art — Yoohoo Art.\nIn this school of ninjutsu, which is known for teasing its enemies, Sayu has learned only ninjutsu such as escape and clone techniques.\nThese ninjutsu are of little use in actual combat, but have an undeniable aesthetic flair.\nAmongst falling leaves, a silhouette vanishes in a flash, a gentle breeze blows, and a kite suddenly appears on the ground... The incredible scene is comparable to an artistic performance.\nThus, whenever there is a festival, Sayu will be invited by various parties to perform her mysterious ninjutsu.\nIf it's Yoimiya who's searching for her, Sayu can still find ways to hide.\nBut if the person in question is Lady Guuji Yae, resistance is futile for Sayu.\nClone techniques do nothing to fool the Lady Guuji's sharp eyes, and aura concealment doesn't help Sayu at all in escaping from the Lady Guuji's grasp.\nRunning for the hills is even less feasible, and might even risk angering the Lady Guuji...\nFortunately, there are very few circumstances that require Lady Guuji Yae to make a personal appearance.",
            "Character Story 5\tFor as long as Sayu can remember, she has been studying ninjutsu with her sensei in the Shuumatsuban.\nAlthough the Shuumatsuban is a clandestine organization, the elders are very kind and have taken good care of young Sayu.\n\"Being overly reliant on others is never a good thing for a ninja.\"\nAfter Sayu had reached a bottleneck in learning ninjutsu, her sensei observed her situation and thought thusly.\nAs the years passed, Sayu grew steadily. Once she was capable enough to defend herself, her sensei chose to leave quietly.\nA young animal that leaves the protection of its parents will grow up rapidly. The same is true of the sensei's expectations for Sayu.\nThe young ninja did not disappoint her sensei. Soon after, Sayu obtained a Vision.\nAnd then, she started working diligently in the Shuumatsuban... diligently shirking her duties.\nSayu is always busy sleeping and hiding from people, so in that sense, she also has a lot to do.\nOccasionally, when Sayu is free and alone to enjoy the moonlight, she feels lost deep inside.\nThe people who have always been with you will one day leave...is this how life is meant to be?\nBut perhaps someday in the future, I will also meet the person who will always be with me.\nPondering the matter, the little ninja fell asleep again...",
            "Mini Mujina\tSayu's outfit is said to be a gift from her sensei.\nThe style references the form of a small animal — the \"mujina,\" and Sayu's favorite colors were also specially chosen for it.\nIt is light and flexible, thus making it suitable for a ninja.\nSayu is especially fond of the huge hood, as it brings about a sense of security.\nThe long tail is designed for Sayu to maintain balance on the branches.\nAs for the only drawback... this outfit probably looks too much like a tanuki, and Sayu often gets misunderstood because of it.\nInitially, she would seriously explain to the other party that:\n\"I'm not a tanuki, I'm Sayu.\"\nHowever, over time, similar incidents have occurred too many times, and Sayu now bears a grudge against tanuki.\nNowadays, if such a situation happens again, Sayu will pout in anger.\nSo, in order to get along well with Sayu, please memorize the following:\nSayu is not a tanuki, but Sayu.\nHer outfit is also not that of a tanuki's, but a mini mujina.",
            "Vision\tThis is the story of Sayu when she just started being on her own.\nFragile beings walking alone in this world inevitably find themselves in scary situations. The only way to understand what it's like is to have experienced it.\nThis is exactly what happened to Sayu. Adept at observation and evasion, she has always understood that she is not suitable for combat.\nHer overly petite stature gives her no advantage in terms of strength to speak of, and her ninjutsu will not be of much use in actual combat.\nYet missions do not wait for ninjas to grow fully before descending upon them. In an era of turmoil, Sayu would also find herself in trouble because of not-so-important work.\nSurrounded by strong foes, she had to do her best and barely managed to escape. It cost her almost everything to bring the information back safely.\nExhausted and wounded, Sayu was about to faint, but only one thing lingered in her mind:\n\"It's not only strong brute force that can overpower everything, the weak have their own way of surviving. It's because you're weak that you can notice those unseen moments that change your fate... The chances of escaping from here are slim, but that's what my ninjutsu is for.\"\nThe moment the leaves fell, she disappeared. All her pursuers were incredulous. The tiny ninja disappeared as if she were dust in the wind.\nThe next morning, Sayu struggled to get up, and found that the ninja pack strapped to her leg had long since disappeared.\nHowever, a surprising object appeared in the same place instead — a Vision gleaming in the sunrise.\nNow, with the power of the Vision, Sayu can wield a claymore taller than herself. She no longer has to fear the omnipresent strife of a chaotic world.\nUnfortunately, Sayu's most immediate worries have not yet been resolved.\nRegarding her growing taller, it seems that even a Vision is unable to do anything about it."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tA new face appeared in town, though none can recall when he first showed up.\nThe young man from the desert would show up at any occasion he was inclined to attend with a bearing so confident and natural that many only realized quite some time later that the person they had spoken with earlier was, in fact, a newcomer. After much asking around, they finally found out his name: Sethos.\n\"So, where did you meet again? He's an old friend of yours, right?\" People would ask each other such questions, before discovering to their surprise that none of them had known him for long.\nLike a grain of sand blown over the high city walls by some wild desert wind, Sethos blended into the crowd with ease, speaking with them of homelands and travels. People warmed to him immediately, for his unforgettable green eyes and way with words led them to believe he would make a good friend indeed.\nAs the sun set, their new friend would regale them with the tale of how he and a group of Eremites had led Sumpter Beasts away from a sandstorm, setting up camp by an oasis to pass the night; of the desert night's bitter cold, and the euphoria of daybreak that made it all worth enduring.\nIn Sethos's telling, suffering is merely another kind of experience, and all experiences can become stories; and the fonder people grew of his stories, the more they looked forward to seeing him.\nBut one time, when his audience had collapsed on the tables in a drunken stupor, the still-sober Sethos was left sitting there spinning his cup.\nThis is what he said:\n\"All of you are always saying I seem too ordinary in my stories. So how about this for a change... In this one, I am the protagonist, and with me I carry a golden key, which I may use at any moment to open a long-lost treasure trove and lead the people to a place of great mystery. There's no way you'd actually prefer a story like that, right?\"\n\"If you ask me, that kind of story is just boring. Stories of extraordinary things happening to ordinary people... those are the ones worth telling! Besides, even if mysterious, special individuals like that did exist, they wouldn't be as young as you.\" The tavern's owner just couldn't stop himself from interjecting.\n\"Exactly,\" replied Sethos, who for some reason looked particularly happy.",
            "Character Story 1\tFew city dwellers have ever seen Sethos running at full tilt. Had they, they would know that this was a young man who could run like no other; any who wished to keep up with him would have to run as fast as the wind.\nSethos himself is very proud of this, and often remarks: \"You're gonna need some special skills if you want to survive in the desert, right? Mine's running, and running fast.\"\nThanks to his fleetness of foot, those around him often entrust him with important errands — though strictly speaking, these aren't actual jobs, not even of the part-time variety. Things like delivering letters for bedridden elderly folks, or fetching homework for forgetful students who left it at home.\nHe is repaid in all sorts of different ways. Some students give Mora and others buy him coffee, while others still have offered up their treasured Genius Invokation TCG cards as a token of their heartfelt appreciation.\nAs for the older folks, their gifts have always been... more unique, shall we say. Aside from money, some even treat Sethos to a home-cooked meal, or dig up some old ornament to present to him as a gift.\nBut the easy-going Sethos always accepts everything he is given. He adds it all to his collection, which he sorts by value: Mora, ornaments, useless odds and ends, Genius Invokation TCG cards, and everything else.\nA woman on Treasures Street once asked him, \"You never say no to any task! Don't tell me you actually enjoy running errands?\"\nSethos loved eating the fried fish rolls she made. Apparently, aside from her own family and neighbors, the helpful Sethos, who lent a hand to her shop, was the only one on the entire street who had ever had the pleasure of tasting that delectable delicacy.\nHolding the meal box she'd just given him, Sethos stood there for quite some time, thinking the question through.\n\"Huh, you're right,\" he finally said, as if something had just dawned upon him. \"Come to think of it, I really do enjoy running errands.\"\n\"You don't want a better line of work? You seem to know a lot, and you're pretty capable, too... If you'd like, I could help you find a job?\" The woman sounded very concerned for him.\nSethos simply waved his hand and pointed at a figure that was flying past in the distance. \"What do you think that person's doing?\"\nThe woman looked up and saw a large, round object sailing by, with what appeared to be a person beneath it. In a tone of surprise, she replied, \"Isn't that another errand-runner?\"\n\"That's Hat Guy, a student from Vahumana who's known for his speed,\" said Sethos, raising his fork. \"But I've heard that sometimes, he also gets called on to deliver letters for the Akademiya.\"\n\"Do you mean that... that's just what he likes to do?\"\n\"No, no, I don't think he likes it, but I'm not like him. I'm a people person, and I enjoy running errands and taking on the easy tasks. And look, you even treated me to a meal! Besides, I've got a proper job too, so don't worry about me.\"\nOver the next few days, Sethos was busy with his own affairs. One day, as he passed by the side gate of the Akademiya to handle something, he suddenly heard a voice jeering at him from the treetops: \"The errand-boy's come running all the way to the Akademiya. Quite the busy little bee, aren't you?\"\nPerched up there on the branch was none other than Hat Guy himself. Smiling back, Sethos raised the lunchbox in his hand and smiled at him, saying, \"I'm just here for lunch — someone gave me this. Want some?\"\n\"I'd say you're no errand boy at all. You've got a more important role.\"\n\"I'd say that you're no student either. You've got a more important role.\"\nSometimes, a few words are all it takes. Without another word, Hat Guy tugged the brim of his hat and vanished in an instant. As for who Sethos really was, or what this \"important role\" of his was... Well, there was no one around to hear their little exchange anyway, let alone care.\nSethos took his time finding a spot with a good view where he could sit down and enjoy this free lunch of his, which he'd received for a multitude of reasons. Having the chance to meet all these different people, and receive all these gifts in return... He was quite satisfied that this was all thanks to his running ability.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere was no way Sethos's drunken companions could ever have remembered the great hero he'd referred to in his story, the mysterious figure who held the key to a treasure trove. The only one who did was the owner Lambad, who would say to his tavern's customers: \"It's the storyteller's own words! Do you think something like that's really possible?\"\nMost of those confronted with such questions could do little more than stare blankly at one another. Dori picked up her fork, complete with fish roll spiked on its tines, muttering: \"If it was, he'd be rich by now.\"\n\"Perhaps he's already become the leader of a tribe? Stories like that are those of the desert,\" rejoined Candace, who was sitting at the next table.\nDehya, however, laughed, as the thought of someone sprang into her mind. Turning to Lambad, she quietly asked: \"And why not? You don't have to be old to have a mysterious background. Who knows, maybe they'd even be the type to drink here, and they'd even have to find a day job, too.\"\nAt this very moment, Sethos was somewhere far, far away. His footsteps were light, despite the pack he was carrying. On the horizon, the sun was slowly sinking, the shadow of night rising through the distant sky. Seeing that the day was nearly spent, a look of fear was writ large upon the face of the Vahumana researcher he was traveling with. Looking at his employer, Sethos handed him some a flask of drinking water without saying a word.\nSethos had considerately slowed down to a fraction of his usual pace so that the researcher would not fall behind. At night, employer and guide shared a single large tent. As Sethos set up the tent, the researcher sat warming himself by the fire Sethos had built, a look of gratitude spread over his face.\n\"You don't seem like you want for money. Why are you willing to guide people like me through the desert? You look like you've lived in the desert for quite some time, too.\"\n\"I had the time, and you needed the help, so I came along. I grew up in the desert, so I couldn't get into the Akademiya myself, and besides, I'm curious about what you're researching. So for me, serving as a guide and a guard for researchers is a chance to hear interesting new things.\"\nSethos's expression was calm and composed, just as it was whenever he told stories, exposing nothing — and he looked quite sincere too. Faced with such sincerity, it was difficult for the researcher to refuse, so he began to recount some entertaining anecdotes about the Akademiya, with complaints about his classmates, colleagues, and research mixed in. Resting his chin on his palm, Sethos sat there listening intently, seemingly fascinated with the researcher's life.\nOver the next week, Sethos accompanied this little-known researcher as he completed his investigation, then seeing him safely back to the Akademiya. When the researcher handed over the payment, Sethos pocketed the money without so much as checking the amount, then walked back out of the entrance with a wave.\nAs he did so, he just so happened to run into the General Mahamatra. As he looked at Sethos, and then at the now-distant researcher, Cyno knew exactly what had transpired.\n\"How's your side-gig going? Do you find their work interesting?\" asked Cyno.\nFollowing Cyno's lead, Sethos leaned against the railing and gazed out onto the sunset.\n\"It was alright. But these scholars are just so stubborn. He kept insisting that there must be a tribe of sages living in seclusion out there in the desert. I told him there was no way they'd be living next to the Mausoleum of King Deshret, but he just wouldn't believe me. In the end, I told him that the place I grew up was just like that, but he didn't believe that either.\"\n\"Tell him that Tighnari, Collei, Dehya, and myself can all vouch for the fact that you are, in fact, from that kind of place.\"\nSethos sighed. \"Then he'd just think me a liar. People from 'places like that' aren't the type who have time for guide work.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tIn Sumeru, both scholars who study King Deshret's civilization and those followers of his who can recite the names of Al-Ahmar and his Seven Pillars by heart know the significance of the \"Temple of Silence.\"\nIt is an extremely ancient organization, and if people knew of its mission, they would sum it up with two words: \"sublime\" and \"stewardship.\"\nIt has been over a thousand years since Hermanubis, the greatest of all sages, established the Temple of Silence. Their sole aim is one that is also truly sublime, and that is to steward the knowledge that should not find its way out into the world. Over the long centuries, the desert has experienced great turmoil. The Temple of Silence has fled from the devastation of war, taking with them all the knowledge they possessed as they moved from place to place. For a time, they came to the rainforest and worked with the Akademiya, but as they could not trust those wielding power in the Akademiya, they left. Finally, they found a place for themselves in a forgotten corner of the world.\nSethos, the one who tells this story, is himself from the Temple of Silence. Despite his claims to be ordinary, he is anything but. Or perhaps an ordinary identity is how Sethos wishes to make up for his own life.\nSethos was born in the desert. His mother is said to have been a merchant, and his father a mercenary, and a number of clues have led some to conjecture that they must originally have come from a desert tribe with a tiny population. But alas, it is unfortunate that Sethos has no memory of his birth parents. As far back as he can remember, he was already in the care of Bamoun, living in the Temple of Silence as his adoptive grandson.\nAfter some years, it was discovered that Sethos's special constitution was capable of receiving a Ba fragment of Hermanubis. As a result of this, he was indwelt by a great power with which he established a sacred connection.\nThe other whose childhood experiences were similar to his — Cyno, the General Mahamatra — had long gained the admiration of Sumeru's people. But Sethos didn't want to become a famed, high-profile figure like Cyno. Therefore, after arriving in Sumeru City, he chose to live in anonymity, assuming the most ordinary of ordinary identities.\nHe found a place to live and invented a perfectly normal and reasonable-sounding family background for himself. Sometimes, he serves as a desert guide, while others, he helps merchant caravans with this and that. When he is bored, he can be found in various locales, chatting with friends to pass the time.\nOf course, that is when he is free; things are very different when he is busy. Lesser Lord Kusanali sometimes invites him to meet with the sages to discuss various issues that arise as they work together — for Sethos has now succeeded Bamoun as the leader of the Temple of Silence, and under his leadership, the Temple has once again established a collaborative relationship with the Akademiya.\nOn the one hand, a perfectly ordinary new resident of Sumeru City; on the other, the new leader of the Temple of Silence. Both of these identities are his, despite the apparent gulf between them.\nIf you were to ask him which life he preferred, however, rather than choosing between them, he would simply reply: \"Ah, come on now, there's no need for that! Making unnecessary choices is such a tiring way to live! Think about it, you wouldn't force someone to choose between a bottle of liquor and a cup of coffee, would you? Aren't they both me?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tBamoun, the previous leader of the Temple of Silence, had been called the \"Bearer of Bloodshed.\" Where this title came from, Sethos neither knows, nor particularly cares.\nGrowing up as one of its members, Sethos had a very particular perspective on the Temple of Silence, one that was the opposite of that of an ordinary child. It took him many years to understand what the Temple of Silence meant for the world.\nAs the leader of such an organization, how heavy was the burden that Bamoun had borne? Sethos believed he knew, yet still found it difficult to imagine.\nThe Bamoun that Sethos remembers is not the stern, upright leader, but rather the kind, patient grandfather. When Bamoun still had his health, he would often take Sethos into the desert.\nCamping, exploring, hunting... if it was fun, they did it; and it was during this period of his life that Sethos learned how to cook, navigate, and set up camp, all thanks to his grandfather's patient guidance.\nAt that time, Sethos was a very mischievous child. He would spend his time endlessly running around chasing tumbleweed, determined to discover whatever it was that they contained. During the daytime, Bamoun would let him run wherever he wanted; but when the sun began to set, he would personally come to fetch him, leading him back to their tent where Bamoun would sit reading through some abstruse books or documents.\nSethos would crouch by his side, sneaking furtive glances at whatever he was reading. Seeing this, Bamoun would say: \"You don't have to pretend you're not looking, you know. This isn't some kind of rare ancient text. You don't think I'd actually bring something like that out here with us, do you?\"\nThe ancient texts cared for by the Temple of Silence are of the utmost importance, and even the leader cannot remove them without good cause. Most of the books that Bamoun brought with him were from his personal collection, while others he purchased from desert merchants.\nGrandfather and grandson would huddle together, reading through the texts one word at a time. When Sethos could not understand, he would sit there scribbling silently away in the sand, writing out riddles he had read about or proverbs that others had told him from memory.\nOne time, he asked Bamoun: \"What's a rabbit?\"\nBamoun replied: \"The prey of beasts; the nemesis of hay.\"\nHe followed this up with: \"What's a flying serpent then?\"\nBamoun chuckled for a moment, then replied, \"It is a creature who blessed you. The priest said that you would have the dexterity of the fox and the agility of the flying serpent.\"\nAfter night had passed and not long after dawn, Sethos would arrive at the top of the hill with the various weapons that he was carrying. In this place, he would hone his combat skills — first ranged, then melee. Archery was taught by several other figures; but it was Bamoun himself who taught him how to fight with a polearm.\nSethos asked Bamoun: \"Is this your favorite weapon, Grandpa?\"\nBamoun replied: \"It is the one for which I am best suited. The polearm is the hallmark of a skilled warrior and the emblem of the brave. Even Cyrus fought with a polearm, though whether he may be considered a brave warrior... That is another question.\"\nSethos did not wait to hear what his grandfather might say about that, but he could tell from his expression that he did not think Cyrus was a coward. In fact, that was precisely why he hesitated.\nLater, Sethos acquired a polearm of his own. Interestingly, it was clear at a glance that it had not been made by any desert dweller. Bamoun did not tell him where it had originally come from, saying only that it had been left behind by Cyrus, and that as it was a fine weapon, no harm in putting it to use.\nSethos was sharp enough that from then on, he had a vague sense of the deeper meaning behind Bamoun's words.\nThere were many times when he had thought to himself: Did Bamoun really hate Cyrus? But perhaps his apparent distaste was simply a way of complaining about the fact that his friend had left. If you actually hated someone, you wouldn't hold on to their old possessions. Yet from the ordinary way that Bamoun had brought out and presented him with the polearm, you would have thought that there was nothing special about it at all.\nWhat the Temple of Silence needed was what Bamoun needed; yet Bamoun's feelings were his own, and were not those of the Temple. As its leader, it was only right that he should hate someone like Cyrus. But as a friend, perhaps he was glad that Cyrus had shown the courage that he had.\nSuch contradictions would not, and could not, persist indefinitely. There would inevitably come a day when his grandfather would find some way of resolving his little differences with the Temple.\nTrimming down branches to help the tree keep growing — that was the type of person Bamoun was. Yet even if he would always remain that kind, patient figure in Sethos's heart, he still carried the burden of bloodshed.\nThe next person Bamoun sacrificed would be himself. Sethos understood that Bamoun too knew his grandson would figure this out sooner or later.\nThus did grandfather and grandson reach a silent understanding — that a day would come when they would no longer be an ordinary grandfather and adoptive grandson, but instead two individuals standing at the crossroads of history.",
            "Character Story 5\tOn many nights, Sethos's stories return to the same word: \"Friend.\"\n\"Friends\" appear in all corners of his stories, each varying in appearance, age, gender, and identity. Sethos never mentions them by name, saying only that: \"My friends are all good people. Without them, it's hard to exaggerate how dull my life would be.\"\nThe General Mahamatra Cyno might be considered to be Sethos's first friend. Strictly speaking, they've known each other for a very long time indeed. Sethos had already spoken to him during those years when Cyno was still with the Temple of Silence. Later on, the two of them underwent the same test, having Ba fragments implanted and losing a portion of their memories as a result. Cyno's reaction was much more severe, causing him to almost completely forget that he had ever lived at the Temple of Silence; whereas Sethos had not been so badly affected, losing only some memories related to people.\nHe couldn't tell you exactly what he'd forgotten. Perhaps his birth parents, or the faces of his childhood friends. Fortunately, with the exception of Cyno, all of his childhood friends lived at the Temple of Silence, so learning what they looked like again wasn't difficult. And despite the fact that they had forgotten each other, he and Cyno were later to meet again, after which they struck up a true friendship. This pleased Sethos very much, who likes to call Cyno his \"bro.\"\nAfter Sethos left the desert, his \"bro\" Cyno's close friend Tighnari also became an important friend of his. Living in Avidya Forest, this Tighnarian Forest Watcher had an endless stock of stories about the forest, its plants, and the people who would get lost in it. Coming from the desert, where such greenery was practically nonexistent, Sethos was full of curiosity about Tighnari's life and work. Sometimes, he and Cyno would go over to Tighnari's place to mooch a meal, and he'd even compete with Collei to see who was better at setting up a camp.\nNot long after, he also made friends with the reliable mercenary Dehya, as well as Candace, the Guardian of Aaru Village. Candace even invited Sethos to visit Aaru Village, telling the residents that he was a \"traveler\" from the heart of the desert.\nSeeing his bemused look, Candace replied, \"You're so busy, rushing here and there every day, so I thought that was the best way to describe you. It must be a wonderful way to live, able to walk on your chosen path...\"\nIt was a still, cloudless day when Sethos returned to the Temple of Silence.\nHe assigned matters that needed to be addressed to those there, and he had also brought back many rainforest specialties to share with his people. Among the members of the Temple of Silence, there were many who had never been to the rainforest, so it was a real treat for them to see such unfamiliar things.\nOnce official matters had been settled, Sethos got out his old waterskin, his favorite lyre, and a leaf from Avidya Forest, then set off. He spent that night by the fire he lit beside Bamoun's tomb.\nHe was not sad, nor was he confused — he simply wanted to return to the place where his grandfather had raised him. Being by Bamoun's side gave him an unparalleled sense of calm.\n\"My friend picked this leaf for me. There's nothing special about it, really. I just thought it looked beautiful, and I wanted to show you.\"\n\"Oh yeah, and another friend called me a 'traveler.' What do you think about that, Grandpa? Whenever you claimed to be a traveler, everyone used to say you hadn't been to enough places. But now I have. Plus, I have plenty of free time, so I guess that makes me more of a traveler than you ever were.\"\nWith this, he threw the leaf into the fire. The flames leapt up for a moment, almost as if a hand were gently waving back at him.\nWith a smile, Sethos gave the firewood a prod and smiled. \"Excellent, I'll take that as a yes.\"",
            "Old Waterskin\tAn old waterskin made from animal hide. It is older, in fact, than its owner. Sethos treasures it greatly and always has it by his side.\nIt was a gift he received from his grandfather. It is said that some tribes reward their warriors with high-quality waterskins. Though Bamoun did not say it to Sethos in so many words, he gave it to him after the latter shot a faraway bird out of the sky while it was in mid-flight.\nThe strap of the waterskin bears his name, engraved by his grandfather's own hands.",
            "Vision\tNormally, a hunt only begins in the wake of a disaster. But sometimes, there are exceptions.\nDue to a companion's mistake, Sethos, Bamoun, and two other members of the Temple of Silence found themselves surrounded by wild beasts. They fought the pack for an entire night, managing to slay several of their number just before dawn.\nIn this encounter, Sethos fought with energy and courage. He knew that Bamoun, being advanced in years and having previously sustained injuries in various battles in the past, was no longer up to the task of taking charge of battles out in the wilds. So as the sun rose on the second day, the first arrow to pierce a beast's skull came from the bow of Sethos.\nBut his arrows, tearing through the swift wind like drops of water falling into a pan of hot oil, simply ignited a fresh round of even fiercer fighting.\nYet in the space of a moment, the ground suddenly began to shift. The beasts, who were focused on hunting down their human prey, failed to notice; and by the time they did, they were already caught in the quicksand, several being swallowed up in an instant.\nSethos led the others to higher ground, using a rope and other tools to climb up to the highest nearby point as swiftly as they could. Of course, the beasts that had not yet been engulfed by the quicksand discovered this refuge too, and threw themselves at it, only to be shot down one by one by Sethos's arrows.\nAfter a moment of chaos, the surviving beasts fled, and the surviving people breathed a sigh of relief. But at that very moment, a storm bore down upon them, and within a short while, it hit them with its full force.\nIn the raging wind, Sethos could barely keep hold of the three others. In desperation, he tied the rope around their waists, tethered the other end to himself, and clung to the back of the rocky mountainside with all his strength.\nHe knew not how long it took, but the roaring sound of the wind finally came to a stop. Holding on as tightly as he could, Sethos slowly pulled the others back to his side.\nAfter observing the weather to ensure it was safe, they returned the way they had come. Along the way, Sethos spotted two more beasts — one large, one small — lying dead at the bottom of a cliff.\nLooking at them from a distance, Bamoun remarked, \"Most likely a parent and a child. The larger one was probably chasing the smaller one, trying to drag it back, before it too lost its footing and they were blown down together.\"\n\"They were with that pack of beasts just now... But weren't there quite a few smaller ones? This large one died trying to save just a single one, and now the other small ones will be left unprotected. The losses far outweigh the gains... It shouldn't have taken the risk,\" said one of the other members, shaking their head.\nTrying to rescue your children first from quicksand, then a storm... It sounded like an almost impossible task. Sethos had noticed, though, that Bamoun had been staring at that spot the whole time, as if it had reminded him of something. But in the end he said nothing more.\nHaving survived the disaster, the group slowly departed, with Sethos bringing up the rear. Before leaving, Sethos glanced back down at the scene below to regard the unsuccessful beast one last time.\nHaving just experienced a genuine life-or-death situation, he now felt an additional weight in his pocket — a Vision. But in moments like that, the chain of events that led up to it happening seemed irrelevant; sometimes, the only thing people could see was the end result.\nSethos gripped the Vision tightly through the fabric of his pocket, reflecting calmly yet deeply upon this truth."

            "Character Details\tShenhe was originally from a branch family of exorcists, but due to a series of coincidences, she became the disciple of an adeptus.\nShe is a student solely of Cloud Retainer in name, but her impressive constitution and intelligence quickly won several other adepti over.\nShe would go on to learn from them all, eventually becoming a master of adeptal arts in her own right as a mortal.\nShe very much looks the part as well in her unique temperament and manner of carrying herself — indeed, it would be no understatement to name her a true adeptus upon meeting her for the first time.\nHowever, it is precisely due to the long years of tutelage that she has lacked company save for the adepti and odd passing illuminated beast.\nThis isolation has caused her to grow distant and indifferent.",
            "Character Story 1\tSometimes, a few rumors will escape from Liyue's small community of pilgrims to make the rounds in the city's back streets.\nThese tales often depict someone being in a hopeless situation in some desperate place, when suddenly—\nA wandering white-haired adeptus comes to their rescue in the nick of time...\nMost such stories are a collection of lovely, intoxicating clichés, little different from the oft-told street-tales of fated marriages and the like.\nBut if one were to ask that white-haired adeptus to tell the story, it would take a vastly different shape:\n\"Some annoying creatures worm their way into the mountains from time to time. I simply get rid of them to prevent them from disturbing my master's meditations.\"\n\"If some people did wind up getting caught in the crossfire and injured... Well, it was their decision to come here. There isn't much I can do about that.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tShenhe is in all likelihood the least accustomed to mortal life amongst those who take on an adeptal appearance.\nHaving been sequestered in the mountains since a young age, she lacks experience and common sense, which makes it difficult for her to relate to people normally.\nTo ordinary people, there are many solutions to any given problem. But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.\nFor example, she almost never considers \"negotiation\" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to \"threats\" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?\nShe has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.\nFor example: Why do we need to pay for food?\nIs there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?\nShe even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.\nIn a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.\nMuch like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.\nMountain Shaper once had this to say about her:\n\"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.\"\n\"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.\"\n\"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tLiyue has no lack of folktales about meetings with the adepti, and many of these concern relative nobodies whom an adeptus took under their wing, thus elevating them greatly.\nHowever, the circumstances under which Shenhe's fate became tied to the adeptal abodes was no such glorious thing. If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.\nWhen she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.\nOver time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.\nHe left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.\nAt last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.\nHer father had brought with him a secret art known as \"Fate Transference\"—\nBy making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.\nAt that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.\nHe claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...\nBut the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.\nHer father summoned that hideous, horrifying black \"seelie\" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.\nStupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.\nCrises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.\nThis creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!\nGripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark \"seelie,\" trembling yet resolute...\nSeveral days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.\nTaking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.\nIf not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.",
            "Character Story 4\tEven the most diffident heart, cooled from living and training in the mountains for over a decade, might sometimes experience strange surges.\nSo it was with Shenhe. On impulse, she came down from the mountains one night to return to what was once her home.\nShe did not know how she felt about her home or her family. She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:\nTo live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.\nShe learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.\nHer childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers — and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.\nShe did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.\nShe simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.\nWas it hatred? Mania? Relief?\nThey were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant. It was as if her heart were an old well without ripples.\nNo, like a barren well with no water upon which there might be ripples.\nShe stood there for a long time, before departing again before the astonished eyes of all.\nEach step was slow indeed, but she never once turned back.",
            "Character Story 5\tLiyue has its own fortune-telling, destiny-reading methods, similar to astrology.\nOf these, there are two fates that people seek to avoid at all costs.\nOne is that of the \"solitary star,\" which dictates that one will be separated from friends and family, living alone all one's days.\nThe other is \"disastrous evil,\" which means that one will face many hardships and perils.\nWhen the adepti rescued Shenhe, Moon Carver did once read her fortune.\nThe signs showed that she was marked by both the \"solitary star\" and \"disastrous evil,\" and that she was also plagued by intense homicidal urges — she was thus a person of supremely ominous destiny, doomed to harm both herself and others.\nTo ensure that she could grow up safely and not harm any innocents, the adepti bound her soul using red ropes.\nThis binding had the effect of restraining both her evil fate and her violent tendencies, but also shackled many emotions that should have originally belonged to a human.\nFrom then on, she became more and more disaffected by trivial matters, and even things most might consider important were but dust to her.\nShe became ever less human, and ever more like a lovely yet cold statue.\nBut surprisingly, she felt something stir within her when she encountered that Traveler from a distant land:\nLong-dormant emotions, now strangers to her, came loose all at once from the depths of fate's tableau.\nPerhaps it really was as Moon Carver once said: that heaven might dictate fates, but destiny's tale is written by mortals. The tale of Shenhe and the mortal world had not yet ended...",
            "White Jade Comb\tOnce upon a time, Shenhe had a full head of black hair.\nWhen she was first brought to Mt. Hulao, she would not say a word. The only thing she proved willing to do was to climb the mountain and watch the sea of clouds.\nIt was well, however, that she would sleep when tired, drink the dew of the mountains when thirsty, and would chew on a few stalks of Qingxin when hungry.\nCloud Retainer took this all in, but did not disturb the girl, instead making this comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her.\nThe adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship.\nShenhe did exactly as the adeptus said without any hesitation. And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.\nOn the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.\nWhen the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained.\n...\nToday, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.\nThrough her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:\nThe first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret.",
            "Vision\tFew people know how the young girl in the cave, intended as a sacrifice by her own father, had been able to stand against the monster for days and nights on end by herself.\nThough Shenhe was born into an exorcist family, her maddened father had not taught her a single thing about exorcism.\nAnd like many at that innocent age, she was also wholly unused to facing life's perils alone.\nBut in that aphotic cave, bereft of parental protection — indeed, betrayed by kin — Shenhe underwent a metamorphosis.\nJust as Moon Carver's readings had shown, the sleeping calamitous fates, violent urges, and unyielding spirit within her burst their bonds all at once.\nThose things served as an unseen shield and invisible blade, arming the girl's frail form.\nThey gave her strength, gave her claws and fangs, allowing her to attack that wretched creature before her, to swear to tear it to shreds — to prove that she, and not it, was the cruelest evil that stalked the darkness.\nTheir life-and-death battle across the next few days was one without end. Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...\nAs the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.\nWith the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.\nThe vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.\nIn the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate. In the future, it would also lead her back to the mortal realm."

            "Good Night\tGreat, it's time to hit the hay! I wonder what dreams await me tonight?",
            "About Shikanoin Heizou: Detective\tA detective should be using their smarts to crush criminals' hopes of getting away with their crimes. So really, a true detective should never even have to touch their weapon.",
            "About Shikanoin Heizou: Keywords\tI've made it a habit of mine to remember everything I observe in the form of keywords. They're a big help to me when I'm trying to make deductions. Take this person for example: we've got \"cat hair on clean trousers,\" and \"scratch on the wrist.\" Looks like they have a soft spot for animals, but they can't get cats to reciprocate... Meanwhile, that one seems very troubled about their \"injured hand,\" and they're wearing a pair of \"brand-new shoes that don't match their well-worn attire\"...

So maybe you could throw one my way every once in a while? Not the ones that involve fighting, running errands, or searching for lost items — as you know, not my style. I only take on big, important cases with lots of mysteries to solve... So, keep an eye out for me, yeah? Hehe.",
            "About Us: Destined Outcome\t\"Coincidence\" is a nice word. It makes things sound like they were meant to be. Unfortunately, as a detective, I don't believe in coincidences. The two of us meeting each other is really the culmination of every choice and move we've made up to this point. So what I'm saying is... our destiny is something we choose.",
            "About the Vision\tOh? So there are rumors that I can overpower my Tenryou colleagues without even using my Vision? Hehe, well, let me set the record straight. One: Although I am technically a Doushin, I'm strictly a detective. My mind is my greatest tool, not my muscles. Two: It's not like my colleagues and I are getting into fights with each other all the time. And three... *sigh* Alright, seems like there's no fooling you. Just... never mind then, okay?",
            "Something to Share: Sense of Achievement\tAs you piece together the trail of clues, it brings you closer and closer to the culprit... and then, that moment when you finally put the last piece of the puzzle into place... I always get such a sense of accomplishment. It's exhilarating!",
            "Something to Share: Doushin\tNot only does being a Doushin come with a certain amount of prestige, it also puts me closer to the action on some of the toughest cases, so the position has definitely broadened my horizons compared to when I was at the detective agency. As for the other duties — patrolling, apprehending criminals, and so on — obviously, I leave that to the more... qualified individuals. There's a limit to how much a single detective can do, you know.",
            "Interesting Things\tQuestion, Traveler, how much do you know about timber? That's right, I'm talking about wood from any ordinary tree you might find along the roadside. Whether a criminal bumps into the bark, disturbs a pile of sawdust, or treads on some leaves, the chances are, they're always gonna leave a trace somehow. Add to that some knowledge of which trees grow in what areas, and if you're lucky, you can infer some crucial details. So, you know: trees. They're a sleuth's best friend.",
            "About Kujou Sara\tMadam Kujou Sara? Yeah, that lady's gotta be the most serious person in the entire Tenryou Commission. It would be nice if she could cut us a little slack and give everyone some breathing room — and she's always on my case about my occasional unexplained absences, but what can I say... I just go wherever the evidence leads me.",
            "About Arataki Itto\tI've done a few favors before to deliver Roasted Lavender Melon to him in prison. This one time, I overheard him singing. The lyrics... were complete trash, but I gotta say — he has a pretty good set of pipes. And it's not every day you come across an inmate who's in the mood to sing their heart out.",
            "About Kuki Shinobu\tThe Arataki Gang is a free and diverse organization that accepts anyone, regardless of their background. Pretty amazing if you ask me. They're lucky to have Shinobu to help keep them all in line. Hmm? How do I know all this? Haha, I mean... as deductions go, this one was pretty elementary.",
            "About Yae Miko\tCome to think of it, Lady Guuji's publishing house also publishes murder mysteries, right? So... when can you introduce me? In this day and age, becoming a famous detective requires more than just ability — you need publicity, too. Huh? C'mon, I'm being serious here!",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: Things in Common\tOh, Kazuha? Yeah, he's a solid guy. With his help, I felt like a locked treasure chest of clues had been bust wide open and emptied all over the ground for me to see. If only I had his sensitivity to the natural world... Oh, I get it now! The wind to him must be like my intuition to me!",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha: Invitation\tOhh... It's such a pity! Since the Vision Hunt Decree's been repealed, I no longer have any grounds to officially arrest him. But then again... I guess now, I can just openly invite him to come to the Tenryou Commission and discuss cases with me.",
            "About Gorou\tGeneral Gorou's constant suspicion made my trip to Watatsumi Island much more eventful... Everywhere I went, there were soldiers keeping me under close surveillance. Honestly, I was a regular, boring tourist just like everybody else. So what if I happen to be a detective in my day job? I was clearly minding my own business there.",
            "About Sangonomiya Kokomi\tI've actually never seen Madam Sangonomiya before. Whenever she appears, practically the whole village crowds around her... I'm not about to contend with that. Oh, and even if you made it through all the villagers, there'd still be a circle of shrine maidens around her! For one of us young people to gain that kind of recognition from everyone, it must have taken a lot of work.",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tI'm barely acquainted with the daughter of the Kamisato Clan. I'm glad that I'm not from some sort of prestigious family like that... it's definitely not the kind of life for me.",
            "More About Shikanoin Heizou: I\tEven if someone chooses to remain absolutely silent, you can still learn a lot about them just by observing their clothes, posture, and facial expressions. Now, if this conversation ended here... what could you gather from my appearance alone?",
            "More About Shikanoin Heizou: II\tOnce, when I was sitting in on a criminal trial, I suddenly realized I'd cracked the case. So I interrupted the court just as they were about to declare the verdict. If my objection had turned out to be invalid, then that moment wouldn't have been the turning point that saw me become a detective. Instead, it would have been... \"Shikanoin Heizou, I hereby find you in contempt of court and order your immediate detention!\" Hahaha!",
            "More About Shikanoin Heizou: III\tInvestigating extramarital affairs, tracking down runaway pets... Those are pretty much the only cases you'll find at a detective agency. I personally need cases of a higher caliber... so, obviously, my only option was to jump ship and join the Tenryou Commission. Another factor was that Sango and I didn't quite see eye to eye in a lot of areas... Just one of those things, I guess.",
            "More About Shikanoin Heizou: IV\tWhen I first joined the Tenryou Commission, I started honing my craft by reviewing some cold cases. Before I knew it, \"Mt. Coldcase\" had been completely leveled... It is a pity, these days I no longer have the time to go back and look through old files. I'm forever being brought in to help out on the toughest cases, and I barely have a moment to catch my breath in between jobs... Well, what can you do. Once you're a detective of this caliber, the cases come to you.",
            "More About Shikanoin Heizou: V\tBy the time a detective is facing a criminal, they have in some sense already failed. Whatever you might do to establish the truth and identify the culprit, you'll never be able to undo the damage caused by the crime. That's why I want my reputation to spread. I want to be a famous detective that makes would-be criminals quake in their boots and quit while they're ahead! In other words, I want to nip crime in the bud. Well, now that you've heard my spiel, why don't you lend me a hand?",
            "Shikanoin Heizou's Hobbies\tWould you like to sit in on a court trial at the Tenryou Commission some time? It's like watching the truth slowly emerge as a collage of facts is pieced together... I can save you a really good seat, but we'll have to pretend like we don't know each other... You know, just pretend.",
            "Shikanoin Heizou's Troubles\tThere are always those people who resort to violence at the very last second, as if that'll somehow solve their problems. It's a real bummer. Victory for me is to see the look on the defendant's face as they finally confess to their crime in the face of my ironclad evidence and watertight deductions... The moment a detective has to use brute force, they've already lost.",
            "Favorite Food\tName me one item of food that doesn't taste better deep-fried. You can't, right? Whether it's meat or veggies, as long as it's been pulled out of the fryer, I'll love it! I don't think anyone with an empty stomach can resist the smell of fried food.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI cannot stand dinner at the Police Station. It's always the same regimented meals, and don't even get me started on the taste. When it comes to food, you can't enjoy it unless you get to pick exactly what you want, right? But nope, poor me has to make do with slipping out and grabbing a quick bite. *sigh*",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tMmm, I love it! You really outdid yourself this time. Well done!",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tWould you say cooking is more of a physical or a cognitive task? Hmm, I believe it's both... No wonder you're such a good cook!",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tHurk! Mmm... let me think. Where did you go wrong here...",
            "Birthday\tAfter I learned that today was your birthday, there was a brief moment when I really wanted to take you to a locked room chock-full of mechanisms and gifts, where you could only get out by solving all the puzzles... Hehe, it's actually really fun! You know, of course I wouldn't do anything like that unless I was sure you'd actually enjoy it. Here, come with me. There's this beautiful scenic spot I've gotta show you before the sun goes down.",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tMy, my! At this rate, the name \"Cyclone\" is really gonna stick, isn't it...",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tThanks for your trust and support, my dear partner. I couldn't have made it this far without your help. Hmm... I suppose we have time for a quick high five, but then let's get back out there and solve some more mysteries!",

Yet, judging by that ever-present grin, you can hardly tell if he is actually there working.\nFunnily enough, all his \"unorthodox behaviors as a public servant\" are somewhat acquiesced to.\nHis colleagues are more than willing to work with him and his boss seldom criticizes him for being this unfettered.\nEven his boss's boss inquires after him every now and then.\nAll this can be safely chalked up to his unrivaled prowess as a detective.\nWhenever the Tenryou Commission is tackling an unusually complicated case, be it a major one or a mysterious one, everyone regards Heizou as their last hope to crack the code.\nEven the head of the Police Station marvels at his extensive experience in solving cases, but Heizou himself has a different opinion about that.\n\"Experience is another name for people's past mistakes, and that's not my trump card.\"\n\"My trump card is something I was born with.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tJoining the Tenryou Commission is no easy task. Not only do you have to pass the ability test, but also a thorough background check.\nTherefore, candidates are usually required to declare some essential information, such as any valuable property.\nAccording to Yoriki Owada, who was in charge of the check at the time, when Heizou applied, he handed in nothing but a blank declaration form.\nIt was a bright and sunny morning. Sitting opposite Owada, Heizou was curiously exploring the place with his eyes. Owada, who had been around the block by then, spent a moment deciphering the blank form, then looked up and insinuated,\n\"I've met many brilliant young people. However, it's a shame that none of them made it to the Station in the end.\"\nHearing this, all of a sudden, that seemingly hyperactive young man stopped looking around, sat up straight, and looked Owada in the eye.\n\"Right. How about a young person like me?\"\nHis switching happened so fast that Yoriki Owada was suddenly stunned, feeling like prey in the sights of some hawk-eyed predator.\nOut of nowhere, a strange sensation came over him, as if at that moment, he was the one being scrutinized.\nHe said jokingly then, as though it would steady his nerves,\n\"The Tenryou Commission does not discriminate against the poor. But if you have literally nothing to declare, then we'll make sure we pay extra attention to your background.\"\nIt was followed by an unexpected silence. The one sitting opposite looked straight at him without saying a word, just as before.\nOwada wasn't feeling his best, his forehead slightly twitching. Maybe it was too hot. He made to wipe off the sweat with the back of his hand.\nHowever, there was no sweat on his forehead at all. Owada stared blankly at the dry back of his hand, not knowing if he should wipe again or put his hand down.\nThe young man burst out into laughter upon seeing this. His hearty laughter immediately relieved Owada from his overwhelmed state.\nHeizou just leaned on the table with his chin in one hand, pointing to his head with the other. He smiled at Owada and said,\n\"Other than my genius, I have nothing to declare.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tThe Tenryou Commission is in fact not where Heizou started his career as a detective.\nBefore all this happened, Heizou once owned an agency called \"Bantan Sango & Heizou Detective Agency.\"\nIt was what was to become Bantan Sango Detective Agency in Inazuma City now, which was actually co-founded by Heizou and Sango in the beginning.\nThe story of the two started with them striking an instant chord with each other, only to end with them regretfully parting ways.\nAfter the breakdown of their partnership, Heizou's name, naturally, was taken down from the old business.\nAs for the reason behind it all, it can probably all be summed up as \"they had different visions.\"\nSango believes that a detective's entire mission is to uncover the truth, which is something of utmost significance. Most detectives also hold this belief dear to their hearts.\nBut Heizou reckons there's more to it. That there might be something that's even more vital than the truth.\nYears of experience working as a detective have made him aware that when a new case comes to him, that means something unfortunate has already happened.\nNo matter how the criminals are punished for their evil conduct afterward, it cannot change the fact that someone has already been hurt.\nSimilarly, no matter how skilled a doctor is, they will never be able to treat a patient and pretend that nothing ever happened, telling them,\n\"Look, all your wounds have healed, as if you were never wounded in the first place.\"\nThe truth is from then on, whenever the patient sees a doctor, sees an infirmary, or sees the scars left by the operation, they will be reminded every time of all the wounds that were once on their body, hurting them.\nDoctors are helpless to prevent violent actions from being executed somewhere. Detectives cannot stop new cases from emerging. But Heizou hopes to break this status quo once and for all.\n\"If I can't nip evil in the bud, then I shall be its natural enemy.\"\n\"The name of Shikanoin Heizou will be renowned throughout the world and intimidate anyone with malicious intent all across Teyvat.\"\n\"They will realize one thing. Once they submit to the darkness, I will hunt them down to the ends of the earth.\"\nIt was at that point that he made his decision to leave the agency and join the Tenryou Commission.\nIt was the starting point for him to become the \"detective\" he seeks to be.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"I've read in the novels that every great detective has an assistant, just like every katsudon has a pork cutlet.\"\nAt the Police Station, the new recruit Uesugi approached Heizou with a big smile on his face.\n\"So, Heizou, what do you think? Can I be your assistant? I'm very clever.\"\nHeizou eyed this chirpy young man up with a grin, then rubbed his chin and replied,\n\"My intuition tells me that you are not that clever.\"\n\"Huh? May... maybe your intuition is wrong.\"\nThe sentence Uesugi just uttered seemed to have some magic to it as if it were a closing joke made at the end of a comedy. On hearing that, his nearby senior colleagues all laughed like a supportive audience.\nThe clever Uesugi immediately realized that he had said something inappropriate, so he tried to patch his statement up.\n\"What I meant is... we can't just rely solely on intuition in our line of work!\"\nUnexpectedly, everyone laughed even harder this time. Uesugi, not comprehending what had happened, thought to himself that maybe he should really consider being a comedian.\nAt that moment, Heizou brushed his shoulder as if to remove the awkwardness along with the dust.\n\"I was just joking. Actually, my intuition tells me that you, Uesugi, are going to be an excellent Doushin.\"\n\"And so, I suggest that you find your own assistant should you have the time.\"\nNo sooner had Heizou finished his sentence than he had run away like the wind, leaving a still-baffled Uesigi and his guffawing colleagues behind.\n...\n\"You've still got a long way to go before you can be Doushin Shikanoin's assistant.\"\n\"I was just trying to help since I noticed that he has no assistant...\"\n\"Of course he does. He mentioned his assistant many times.\"\n\"What?! Has he?\"\n\"Didn't you hear him say 'my intuition tells me' multiple times?\"\n\"Huh?! Are you saying... that his assistant is... his intuition?!\"\n\"Exactly! That guy can solve cases merely with his intuition. Isn't that wild?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen it comes to performance, Heizou should've been promoted many a time, considering all his achievements.\nHowever, in reality, Heizou has been a Doushin ever since he joined the Tenryou Commission.\nOn the other hand, many among his colleagues and superiors have risen through the ranks as a by-product of his achievements.\nAfter Heizou's cousin, Kano Nana, heard about it, she came to Heizou and was determined to stand up for him.\n\"You may be a brat, but this unfair treatment you've suffered is way worse.\"\n\"I'm going to give those goons a piece of my mind!\"\nHeizou knew his cousin very well, so to save her from any trouble, Heizou patiently explained the reasons behind this situation — a rare thing for him.\n\"Cuz, don't consider me lesser than them.\"\n\"Wanna take a guess at how many inmates at the Police Station Jail can name the Yoriki?\"\nHeizou spread his fingers of one hand, palm facing her. \"This number at most.\"\nHaving no idea what he was getting at, Kano Nana replied hesitantly, \"Five?\"\n\"What about the ones who can name this genius detective right in front of you?\"\nHeizou spread his fingers of the other hand, this time palm facing himself, \"This many at least.\"\n\"Five again? What's the difference?\"\nHeizou laughed, \"Cuz, I'm talking about the number of hairs on my hands!\"\n\"Just like we have no hair on our palms, none of the inmates can name all the Yoriki.\"\n\"But the inmates who can name me are as many as the hairs on the back of my hand!\"\n\"Now that my influence has far exceeded that of those Yoriki, what's in it for me to get promoted?\"\n\"On the contrary, staying close to the front line means that more criminals will be intimidated by the name of Shikanoin Heizou — that's my ultimate goal.\"\n\"So don't worry about me, cuz. I have never strayed, and I will never stray from my path!\"",
            "Character Story 5\tJust as Heizou claims, the most well-known name at the Police Station Jail is not that of any Yoriki, or even that of the General of the Tenryou Commission... But is instead the name of Doushin Shikanoin Heizou.\nHere, at least, even the name of the Raiden Shogun herself might be lesser in stature compared to his.\nAfter all, none of these criminals, great or small, have ever been personally nabbed by the Shogun, but a great many of them are surely here on Heizou's account.\nThis is how things panned out:\nIt started with some arrogant crooks boasting while temporarily out from behind bars of how elite their criminal skills were and how they had sent government officials off on wild goose chases, seeking to gain the admiration of their fellows.\nBut when asked why they were caught in spite of their great skills, they would often blame, through clenched teeth, the matter on \"that detective.\"\n\"Not that I didn't try, mind you, but he's just too cunning!\"\nThus did the detective's name spread throughout the prison.\nEven later on, the situation would again change when the criminals discovered that the detective who caught them was someone named \"Shikanoin Heizou.\"\nIt was one thing if a single detective could catch some skilled crooks. Perhaps he was just a good detective.\nBut if countless high-level criminals were seized by this one man, then surely he could not be an ordinary person.\nIn that moment, everyone present imagined something similar.\nA trickster god in the guise of humanity, scheming and cunning beyond compare, seeing into the hearts of mortals with contemptuous ease.\nWhy, a change of sides would see such a fellow become the greatest criminal in history!\nThose who were unwilling to take part in further affray spoke no more, while even the most hardened and wicked amongst them secretly thought:\n\"It might be best not to take him on, or to speak more ill about him than we should.\"\nEven the fiercest criminal lords no longer use his name even when they wish to boast, instead using the pseudonym \"Cyclone.\"\nWhen the Doushin on guard duty heard this new title, they would ask what it meant.\nAnd some petty criminals would reply, \"A calamity! A plague upon all us crooks!\"",
            "Martial Arts Tournament Champion's Medal\tThe way Heizou sees it, detectives are to destroy their opponents' defenses using their intelligence.\nUsing force to subdue criminals is, inevitably, the inferior way of doing things, and so Heizou does his best to avoid this in his daily work.\nAs such, his reputation at the Police Station was, for the longest time, one of a brainy but dainty character.\nThus, everyone was all too sure that he would be in for a tough time at the internal martial arts contest held by the Station.\nThis would be a no-holds-barred contest: neither limitations on schools nor restrictions of weapons would hold any sway here. The only rule was that the one to knock their opponent from a fifty-pace ring would triumph.\nTo everyone's shock, however, the \"brainy\" Heizou would show up to this contest without using Vision, and he carried no weapon but his two bare fists, which in turn carried him to the final.\nDuring that match, Kujou Sara, who had arrived upon hearing rumors of his prowess, assessed that the match was over even before it began.\n\"Doushin Shikanoin moves lightly and his fists are the match of any weapon. It would be hard to match him in melee — and only a skilled bowman would triumph.\"\nAs she predicted, Heizou's opponent would concede defeat after taking seventeen punches to the left side, with only a streak of Heizou's hair sliced off to show for it.\nBut just as he was about to be crowned champion, Kujou Sara herself walked into the ring and picked up a training bow, requesting a match with Heizou.\nThere was a brief uproar. Most of the people participating in the tournament were rather junior Doushin, and no one had expected that General Kujou herself would attend.\nHeizou narrowed his eyes. He had originally only come to test his skills, such that he might not be found wanting in the extreme situations where his wits alone would not be sufficient.\nBut at this moment, his blood was up and the spirit of competition had descended on him like it often does on youths, and so he gladly accepted. In a flash, the atmosphere heated up and everyone was flushed with excitement.\n\"Great going, Heizou!\" Doushin Uesugi yelled from the stands, Yoriki Owada quietly pumping a fist from beside him.\nAfter a moment's preparation, both parties entered the ring. The rules were slightly different this time: neither of them would use their Visions. This would only be a contest at fifty paces between Sara's arrow and Heizou's fists. Whoever touched the other first with their weapon would be declared the victor.\nThe atmosphere by now was practically bursting at the seams. The battle was about to begin. Yet few realized that in a battle between experts, each move was peril itself, and that the match would be ended in a single shot.\nSara let fly, and fifty paces away, Heizou was seen with his right hand clenched in front of his chest, tightly gripping an arrow that quivered but two finger-widths from his heart like a striking serpent.\n\"It's my loss. What a frighteningly fast shot,\" Heizou said with a laugh, before throwing the arrow aside. \"There was no time to evade, General, so I was forced to touch your weapon.\"\n\"I won by dint of the rules alone. I have met very few who could catch one of my arrows barehanded. I doubt the result would be so certain, were this a real battle.\"\nSara's eyes glimmered as she spoke such praise.\n\"Doushin Shikanoin, you are skilled in both mind and hand. You will do great things, should you be more disciplined.\"\n...\nHalf a month later, a champion's medal specially made by the Tenryou Commission arrived at the Grand Narukami Shrine, along with a handwritten note.\n\"Here's a little something, cuz, for you to give to my old man when you've got the time. Y'know, just to let him know that I haven't completely made a mess of his teachings and all.\"",
            "Vision\tHeizou mentions his childhood very little, for it was not a happy one.\nHe was born in a remote village where his ancestry was rather prominent and his father was a martial artist of some small repute.\nBut just like every other rebellious child in the world, he only wished to escape having to take up his father's work, even as he was forced to learn martial arts alongside him.\nThis state of affairs would persist until Heizou made a friend who claimed to be from a wealthy merchant family at a festival.\nThis friend was a bright and agile mind, and would often bring all manner of new gadgets for Heizou to play with, saying that they were from his family's storehouse.\nBooks from Sumeru, mysterious toys from Fontaine of all sorts... These toys injected significant vibrance into Heizou's otherwise monotonous life.\nThe friends grew closer as they grew older, but Heizou also began to notice a problem.\nHis friend's clothes were always filthy, hardly the sort of image a rich merchant's son should have.\nHe thus decided to have an honest talk with his friend. They would have a conversation like proper adults.\nUnexpectedly, his friend immediately admitted to having deceived him, and even confessed that all the gifts he had given Heizou were stolen from the local merchant's guild.\nHe even went so far as to relate that he had originally met Heizou at the festival with the intention to steal some valuables from the latter, only for them to have become friends instead.\nHe laughed as he confessed these matters, as if this was some interesting tale.\nHeizou was furious, though he knew not what he was angry at: was he angry at having been deceived by his best friend? Or was it because his best friend was a criminal?\nRegardless, he reprimanded his friend harshly: \"We're not friends anymore!\"\nFuming, he returned home, sought out each and every item he had been given, and threw them all out, till nothing but a single green pebble remained.\nThis was one of a pair of \"treasures\" the two of them had fished out from a small stream, and each of them had taken one. This item alone was not tainted by theft, and was perhaps purer even than their friendship.\nGazing upon it, Heizou hardened his heart and threw it out the window... only for it to strike the window lattice and come flying back, rolling under his bed.\nNow irate, and seeing how even the heavens were conspiring against him in this endeavor, Heizou, in a fit of growing pique, dumped himself on the ground like a frog with a punctured belly, refusing to move.\nLooking at the ceiling despondently, he told himself that he would one day put these ill things out of his mind. Yet the world is such that the more we wish to forget things, the more they shall refuse to be forgotten.\nA year later, when the festival where he and his friend first met rolled back around, Heizou happened to rediscover the pebble, and had it on him as he traveled to attend the festival.\nHe knew not what he was expecting, but fate already had an answer on hand... though it was not the one Heizou expected.\nHeizou would meet his friend again that day, collapsed by the roadside in a pool of his own blood amidst the screams of the crowd.\nJust a moment earlier, his friend had gotten into an altercation with a ruffian who had angled to steal his Mora purse, and who then in a panic had plunged a dagger into his heart.\nHeizou dashed over to check on his old friend, the pebble in his hand falling by the wayside. Catching sight of it, his friend's dull eyes lit up just a little.\n\"Come here to see me, did you... Heizou?\"\nHeizou tried to keep pressure over his good friend's chest, but the blood kept seeping through his fingers, and he was again filled with fury, even more so than the year prior.\n\"Just shut up! Shut up!\" He yelled at his friend.\nHis friend shook his head, and with great effort opened his purse. There was not a single Mora inside — nothing but the green pebble that had belonged to him.\nSqueezing the last ounce of his strength out, he held the pebble out to Heizou with a smile broader than when they had parted.\n\"I... I came to see you, too...\"\n...\nHeizou did not recall how he had returned home. His mind was blank, filled with nothing but rage and disgust.\nBut in that moment, his intuition told him that he felt rage and disgust at a certain thing, and that he and it had always been foes.\nThis thing had mixed deception into friendship, and it had caused life to be cut short before its time. \"Sin.\" That was its name.\nBut it was not his friend's sin of deception or theft, nor was it the murder that the thief committed. It was something more abstract, something of a higher order.\nIt was the culmination of all the sins in this world, hovering over all like a titanic shadow covering the skies, fixing its cold and unfeeling gaze on all that was good in this world, and seeking ways to snuff it out.\nOne morning, one month later, Heizou sneaked out of doors to travel afar, leaving a farewell note behind. He had found his enemy, and he would now embark on a journey to make war against it.\nAccompanying him on this journey was a green stone, but it was not the pebble that symbolized friendship, but instead a Vision that stood for his resolve."

Sadly, not a lot of people seem to understand that. Why do they force themselves to keep working in the production zone, when it's obvious that they're so tired they can barely keep their eyes open? I always sneak them some extra food, but beyond a point, if they aren't gonna do what's good for them and get some proper rest, they leave me with no choice.

But that's okay. We Melusines have very long lives, so as long as I never stop studying medicine, the range of illnesses I can cure can only keep increasing, and the amount of suffering can only keep decreasing. I'll always follow my teacher's example, doing everything in my power to save the people I can reach...

            "Character Details\tWithin the huge undersea facilities of the Fortress of Meropide, Sigewinne's infirmary is one of the few places open to all people at all times.\nA guard might have a terrible bout of illness while out on patrol at night, and have to be helped over to the infirmary by his colleagues, only to find that a hot drink and a clean bed had already been prepared, awaiting his arrival. Or an exhausted inmate might collapse from overexertion at their lunch desk, then awake to find their meal by their bedside, snug within an insulated container...\nAs they made these discoveries, Sigewinne's smile would also come into view, swiftly relieving both fright and fatigue, helping them to calm down and accept treatment and care.\nAll are in awe of her dedication, yet are also puzzled by the warmness of her heart.\nTo be consigned to the Fortress is a punishment in and of itself, and even the most youthful and energetic of guards must take a day off after consecutive days of work. Yet Sigewinne has taken precious few of these throughout Wriothesley's entire tenure as administrator. The lights in the infirmary are always on, and it seems that they'll never be put out... The motivation behind such enthusiasm may as well be an enigma to guard and inmate alike.\n\"Could it be that she is an emissary sent from the heavens to watch over us?\"\nWhat began as a single inmate mumbling away to themselves after seeing the wings on Sigewinne's back was swiftly taken up others, until before long the vast majority were behind it. In this world without light beneath the waves, she had become their \"sun,\" bringing a radiant warmth to their dark, damp prison.\nTo repay this \"angel\" for her care, the guards have an \"unwritten rule\" beyond the many administrative systems already present — any who are rude to Sigewinne are punished extra harshly. The inmates, for their part, also have an unspoken agreement that any particularly wild and violent newcomers must receive a \"warning\" upon being admitted. After all, they had to be made aware that the community would brook no affront to their angel, didn't they?\nSigewinne herself is blissfully unaware of all these customs that have cropped up around her, and simply serves her patients as she always has. However, there will always be some curious person who will ask:\n\"Head Nurse, why do you stay here to take care of us? Don't you get tired or, y'know, annoyed?\"\nWhenever this happens, Sigewinne's brows tend to furrow (a rare sight indeed), as though the question was absurd.\n\"Hmm... Have you ever had a pet cat? You take care of them, and watch them be cute in their various ways... That's something that makes you happy in and of itself, isn't it? Why would anyone ever get tired of something like that?\"\nMost who ask cannot quite believe their ears when they receive such an answer, and those they tell are even less convinced.\n\"Nonsense, if ever I've heard it! I'd sooner believe that angels exist!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tIn the days just following Sigewinne's appointment to the post of Head Nurse, the Fortress saw many instances of inmates overworking themselves.\nEven without being ordered to do so, many would persist in working when rest times rolled around. Perhaps they were simply looking for a faster way to get their hands on temporary luxuries to lavish upon themselves, or place another bet in the next boxing match — either way, the Credit Coupons caused many an inmate to sacrifice their health in pursuit of their desires.\nSeeing all this confused Sigewinne, yet she was unable to do anything about it. The way she saw it, \"exhaustion\" was an \"illness\" that humans actively sought to afflict themselves with.\n\"But since it is an illness, I could come up with a cure, couldn't I?\"\nSo thinking, she began sourcing for ingredients, eventually coming up with a type of medicine that was to her satisfaction. Both packed full of nutrition and delicious, in her eyes it was a sure-fire winner.\nYet when she first tried to use it, the inmate she was treating blanched in terror at the sight and refused to take it.\nBewildered by this reaction, Sigewinne sought help from many sources, eventually receiving her answer from the inmate who served as head chef.\n\"Sounds like a piece of cake to me! We chefs can turn anything into a gourmet dish, even the ugliest-looking roots and rhizomes around.\"\nThough she found herself disagreeing with his definition of \"ugly,\" Sigewinne was grateful for the head chef's help, and so she showed him the ingredients she had prepared.\nThere was a long silence as the head chef looked over the items before him.\n\"Head Nurse, I will do my best. Oh, and if you don't mind, next time you send me the ingredients... Don't let anyone see them, alright?\nSigewinne did not understand why he was so worried, but seeing his earnest gaze, she agreed. Afterwards, she was to give this medicine the official name of \"Nutritious Meal,\" and thus did it become one of the secret menu items at the canteen — one that would inevitably show up on an inmate's tray the day after they overworked themselves.",
            "Character Story 2\tAfter Sigewinne became Head Nurse, the fact that she looked like a human yet was actually a Melusine became an open secret, and the news spread even beyond the Fortress's walls.\nSome guessed that she might be a descendant of mixed human and Melusine blood, but any who discussed this possibility would receive a stern warning from the Marechaussee Phantom. Even Iudex Neuvillette would personally come out against such rumors, \"with the intent to quash such inappropriate, discourteous canards.\"\nSome guessed that she might be wearing a special mask and gloves, postulating that this made it easier for her to blend in with humanity. But most quickly refuted this belief, for the time when humans had ostracized Melusines was now far behind them, and there was no need for Sigewinne to live in this way.\nNewspapers quickly seized upon the selling power of this public curiosity, and many reporters were dispatched to the Fortress to interview her.\n\"Forgive me for asking, but might we know how you came to look the way you do?\"\nThe reporters tactful approaches belied their urgency. Sigewinne, after giving the question some serious thought, began to tell a story woven from distant memories—\nIn the times when humans and Melusines did not yet trust one another, only one little girl was willing to make friends with a Melusine. Later, when she fell seriously ill, Sigewinne was the only doctor who was able to make it on time. But because she was a Melusine — and only because of that — the girl's parents did not allow Sigewinne to enter.\nTo save her friend, Sigewinne looked for a frightening witch and begged her to help. Having ascertained Sigewinne's resolve, the witch gave her a bottled potion of brewed sin. After using it, Sigewinne gained a human countenance, hands, and feet, and by so doing managed to save her friend.\nHaving listened to this story, the reporters glanced at each other.\n\"Head Nurse, this is a fairy tale, isn't it?\"\n\"It's true, you know.\"\nThey looked into the Melusine's eyes, then back at each other. Each of them was among the elite of their profession, and they all believed that they could see through an interviewee's lie with ease, yet there was no trace of falsehood in Sigewinne's expression.\nAnd so it was that they returned in vain, and perhaps there was consensus that the public would not be convinced by the story, for Sigewinne's answer was never published.\nAfterward, those around her came to believe that this was a matter she had no wish to discuss, and thus they privately agreed that no one was to ask her again. Perhaps only Sigewinne herself knows that she had hidden nothing, though she might not have understood the full truth at the time.",
            "Character Story 3\tEver since entering the Fortress, Sigewinne has maintained a correspondence with Neuvillette via letters.\nShe responds earnestly to every letter he sends, and out of concern for the possible boredom that he might have to endure in the Palais Mermonia, she sometimes even includes anecdotes about some interesting things that have happened at the Fortress.\n\"Dear Monsieur Neuvillette, I am doing very well right now. I received the medical items in a shipment a while back — thank you very much for selecting them and arranging for their arrival.\"\n\"Something quite interesting happened recently. A newly arrived youngster brought down an old bully who's been throwing his weight around for a long time now. He was injured in the process, though. He is very young indeed, but he's tougher than any adult I've met so far. He even refused anesthetics when I was stitching his wound, saying that he wanted to keep his head clear...\nNeuvillette's reply that time came a good while earlier than usual. He seemed to have recognized the young man Sigewinne had mentioned, and requested that she took close care of him. Although he wrote in the same officialese as usual, Sigewinne could sense that he was following this young man with interest.\nAs such, matters concerning this young man would become a common feature of her letters to Neuvillette.\n\"Dear Monsieur Neuvillette, he has injured himself in a fight again, and refused anesthetics as always... I snuck some into his tea anyway, stitching him up after he fell asleep. He never cries out when I treat him, but I know how painful it must be for him.\"\n\"Dear Monsieur Neuvillette, he still refuses to drink the milkshakes I make for him, even though they'd do him a lot of good...\"\n\"Dear Monsieur Neuvillette, he has grown quite a bit. Perhaps he might even be a little taller than you are now...\"\n\"Dear Monsieur Neuvillette, the medical supplies that I reported as missing in my previous letter have now been found, thanks to him. It seems that there are no longer any secrets that may be kept from him down here...\"\n\"Dear Mr. Neuvillette, based on your previous instructions, I am to address him as 'Your Grace' now, yes?\"\n...\nMany years later, after the young man named Wriothesley had become the new administrator of the Fortress, through some coincidence he discovered Sigewinne and Neuvillette's status as pen pals.\n\"Just as I thought. Our dear Iudex placed a spy by my side.\" \n\"Why do you say that? I only mentioned you in my letters because Monsieur Neuvillette was concerned about you.\"\nWriothesley did not agree with this, but he did not refute it directly, instead choosing to talk about a certain encounter from before he went to prison. At that time, wracked with hunger, he had been flipping through a discarded newspaper, searching for some opportunity to make Mora. However, the one he had met was not the \"concerned\" Monsieur Neuvillette, but rather a warm-hearted Melusine officer. It was only thanks to the food she gave him that he managed to make it through at all.\n\"The Iudex does not... Or to be precise, he cannot show concern for anyone. This is one of the restrictions he must accept as the Iudex. Even his subordinates are freer than he is to show concern for others.\n\"Nonetheless, do continue writing to him about anything you like. I suppose that is one of the restrictions I must accept.\"\nSigewinne, too, did not attempt to refute Wriothesley's view, even as he left — for she had never imagined that he, despite everything he knew, would come to such an incorrect conclusion. Long ago, when the Melusines had just come up to the surface world, many of them would present gifts to humanity as gestures of goodwill. Yet this was exploited by evil folk, bringing danger upon many Melusines. Thus it was that Neuvillette gathered them all, strictly prohibiting such behavior. If it were not for Neuvillette's express instructions, that Melusine officer would never have given Wriothesley any food herself.\nAfter much deliberation, Sigewinne decided to pen a new letter.\n\"Dear Monsieur Neuvillette, I have finally found a secret that even he does not know...\"",
            "Character Story 4\tAs far as Melusines are concerned, humans aging, falling ill, and dying is as natural as the sunrise and sunset.\nThis is the first thing all Melusines understand in their attempts to understand humans, for it is the biggest difference between them. Many Melusines' understanding of humanity also stops here, for what they faced when they came onto land was human wariness and rejection; so they returned to the waters, giving up on further investigation into the transient lot that is humanity's.\nUnlike these Melusines, Sigewinne's curiosity bid her stay, and also alerted her to the magic of the science of \"medicine.\" It was said that this magic was quite marvelous, even able to change the natural law known as death by age and ailment.\nSigewinne wished to master this magic, believing that it might help bridge the chasm between Melusines and humans, allowing the former to blend in with the latter. Unfortunately, in the days when Melusines had first entered society, none among the humans understood her thought process, and even less so were they willing to impart medical skills onto her.\nThis persisted until a traveling doctor who the children called \"the witch\" encountered the Melusine, and heard her out.\n\"Seriously? What do you think medicine is? How childish.\"\nSigewinne was expecting to be rejected even as she silently bore the criticism, only for the \"witch\" to scare off a few children who were looking to ridicule the Melusine, before waving for her to follow.\n\"Might as well come with me, then. I'll show you what the real answer is.\"\nThus did Sigewinne come to own her very own medical kit, learning medicine at the feet of this \"witch.\" The latter was an excellent doctor and a dutiful teacher alike. There was almost no illness that she could not cure, no technique she could not teach.\nAs their travels gradually took them all across Fontaine, Sigewinne had already learned how to prepare various medicines as well as scare off children with ghost stories, and she would also call this \"witch\" her \"Teacher.\"\nOne day, this traveling doctor of a \"witch\" would stop her wandering feet, and with a serious expression that seemed somewhat out of character, called Sigewinne over to assist her.\n\"What shall we use to cure this person, Teacher?\"\n\"There is no cure. Just give them some painkillers.\"\nThis was the first time Sigewinne had ever heard her teacher make such a pronouncement. Though shocked, she prepared the relevant substance nonetheless. Then, she watched as the suffering patient calmed down, said their farewells to their family members, before passing on peacefully.\nIn the night, the two of them would continue their journey.\n\"I didn't know there were illnesses you could not cure, Teacher. Are there more of them?\"\n\"Oh, lots. No matter how advanced medicine becomes, there will always be incurable illnesses.\"\n\"Then why does medicine exist?\"\n\"All humans will die. In which case, why do humans exist?\" replied the \"witch.\"\nHearing her Teacher's response, Sigewinne teetered on the edge of understanding. She thought back to the farewells they had seen earlier, rifling through her memories for an answer.\n\"For their smiles? Their tears?\"\nHer teacher, ever serious, suddenly gave her a rare, gentle smile.\n\"Let's leave it at that for now. Once you've figured it out, not only will you understand medicine, but humanity as well.\"",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Fontainians were originally Oceanids, and their bodies will dissolve in Primordial Seawater.\"\nThat great flood washed away the sins of all Fontainians and revealed the shocking truth at the same time. Of this matter, Sigewinne had a far greater understanding than most. After settling the inmates injured in the flood, she returned to the Fortress ahead of time and took out that letter, sealed securely in a bottle as it had been for hundreds of years.\n\"I assume that if you're opening this letter, you've understood all those things I had doubts about, just as we agreed?\"\n\"No matter. I know I need not worry. You've always done as I said, trusting me unconditionally. As such, allow me to open with an apology. I lied to you, even at the end.\"\n\"The strange illness I discovered manifests as the dissolution of the human body. All bodily tissues and structures will dissipate, leaving behind a liquid that appears as close to pure water as might seem possible. Even by using myself as an experimental subject and forcing myself into a fatal impasse, I could not find the answer to curing the disease in this liquid. All I gained was one meaningless discovery — that if you mixed this liquid with some specific ingredients, you will obtain a face-changing solution usable by Fontainians alone. With this solution, they can change their appearance into anything they desire.\"\n\"I originally thought it useless... until you found me, and told me of your dilemma, of being unable to save your friend due to being a Melusine. It suddenly occurred to me that it might also have some effect on a Melusine constitution, and that this predicament I found myself at may yet have some purpose.\"\n\"That is why I tricked you. The bottle on the table is not some sort of mysterious potion, but the final gift I can leave you after I have dissolved myself.\"\n\"Just take it as a sort of medicine — after all, didn't I tell you that we had to be willing to resort to trickery to get children to drink theirs?\"\nHaving finished reading the letter, Sigewinne returned to the place she had chosen to memorialize her teacher, now armed with the full truth.\nThere was no gravestone here, only an unremarkable water's edge. Sigewinne had never found her teacher's body, and so had set up a simple cenotaph for her. Hundreds of years later, the monument had in turn been swallowed up by the constantly rising waters.\nSigewinne did not begrudge her teacher that lie, for she could feel the \"warmth\" in it each time she touched her cheeks.\n\"Thank you, Teacher.\"\nAnd she laid that letter upon the waters, and watched it drift far away.",
            "Melusine-Specialized Portable Integrated Medical Apparatus\tIn the days before the main body of the Fontaine Research Institute had yet to float in the skies, the researchers would also accept some research projects that lay outside the scope of their usual investigations as a way to repay their benefactors.\nThese projects were largely dry, uninteresting, but tolerable sacrifices for the sake of courting sponsors. Still, some would be outright ridiculous, to the point that the researchers might consider having their funding cut to be preferable to actually carrying them out.\nOne day, one such task appeared, finding pride of place on their announcement boards.\n\"Extra Urgent: Specialist Medical Device Development.\"\n\"Requirements: 1. Portable, Small Size, Lightweight, to be carried with ease by a person with the build of a small child. 2. Needs to contain all needed medical implements for emergency calls (if present medical instruments cannot meet these requirements, a new complement of devices will need to be created separately.) 3. Contains a function with which to perform routine health checkups. 4. Must have a cute design.\"\nThose who had gathered around the board to read this began to scrunch up their brows as they did so, and finally, they could not contain their anger any longer.\n\"What sort of request is this? Never mind the how strict the requirements are — they're self-contradictory, too!\"\n\"A cute design? What are we, toymakers?\"\nBut the person who had put up the notice was unfazed by their infuriated response.\n\"The commissioner is the Melusine head nurse at the Fortress of Meropide.\"\nAt this, the researchers — who just moments before had been the very picture of outrage — fell utterly silent, until finally someone shouted out:\n\"We're bidding for this one — no preferential treatment for those on shift! Also, anyone who complained just now is automatically out of the running!\"\nAfter just a single month, Sigewinne had received a most satisfactory product. From then on, this heart-shaped medical kit could be seen at her hip wherever she went, indeed becoming one of her calling cards.\nIf she had but one complaint, it would have to be its awful mouthful of a name — the \"Melusine-Specialized Portable Integrated Medical Apparatus.\"",
            "Vision\tSigewinne is a most skilled medical practitioner indeed. Since entering the Fortress of Meropide, she has almost never encountered an illness she could not treat. And as the number she has saved has increased, so too has everyone's respect for her. As long as it's medical advice she gives, they will follow it to the letter.\nStill, there was one exception.\nThis was an inmate by the name of \"Oldstone,\" whose real name no one knew. They knew only that he had been serving his sentence for many years already, coming to spend his twilight years beneath the waves on account of its sheer length. His body grew more and more frail, but he would always reject treatment from Sigewinne.\n\"Don't bother me. No one can cure me.\"\nWith such words he would refuse her each time she tried to give him a checkup. Eventually, she was forced to make use of her connections with the prison administration, calling upon the aid of several guards to drag those old stony bones into the infirmary. Thus did the long-overdue physical examination begin, but the result was one of despair — the old fellow's condition had long since been terminal, and was not something that Sigewinne could treat, for all her skill.\n\"See? I told you so!\"\nOldstone crowed in triumph as he looked into her defeated eyes, only for his laughter to turn into a bout of intense choking and bloody coughing, until finally he lost consciousness.\nAfter this, the arrogant old fellow was rendered bedridden. And for the first time, Sigewinne found herself feeling trapped in that now so familiar infirmary, not knowing what to do aside from watch over Oldstone as his final days slipped away.\nStill, she noticed that he would constantly stare at a specific date on the calendar, some strange light stubbornly lingering in those long deadened eyes of his.\n\"No matter how advanced medicine becomes, there will always be incurable illnesses.\"\n\"Then why does medicine exist?\"\nSigewinne remembered the question she once asked her teacher, and suddenly realized that she might now pen the final annotation of her answer. So she came to Oldstone's bedside, and once again extended an invitation to him.\n\"My Teacher once told me that a doctor's greatest duty is not to cure all diseases, but to cure the ones they can. So let me help you.\"\n\"You're saying there's something wrong with me that you can treat?\"\n\"That's right. It's your inability to last till that day comes.\"\nHe stared back at her in shock, but was ultimately won over by the resolve in her eyes.\nIn the following ten or so days, despite his unwillingness, he drank every last concoction she gave him. His condition did not improve, and indeed his bloody coughing only increased in intensity and volume, but by some miracle he made it past the date of the death sentence his disease had passed upon him — made it to that day on the calendar.\nOn that day, a mother and her son showed up in the infirmary. The son had been plying his trade as a merchant in Liyue, and this was the earliest he could hurry back to Fontaine. He first upbraided Oldstone for his failures as a father, then, upon receiving the old man's earnest apology, soaked the sickbed's sheets with his tears, before finally sending Oldstone off with a smile when that final moment came.\n...\nAfter Oldstone's funeral, Sigewinne received a box of thank-you gifts from that mother and son. Just as she was about to pass them on to her patients, her eyes came upon something shiny.\nAnd what was it but a brand new Vision, as if the gods themselves had seen all her deeds, and sent her a gift of their own as well.\nStill, she did not display too much joy or surprise, instead taking this as just another annotation for her answer.\nHow she wished her Teacher were here in this moment!

It's only our first time meeting, I shouldn't trouble you. But... if you're willing, I'd love to hear any stories you have about your adventures. I'd... really like that.",

            "When It Snows\tSnow this big only falls a few times a year. If I miss it, I'll have to wait until next year to run my experiments, so please give me some space. Ah-Ahchooo! ...Yes, I know, I should wear more layers...",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tThe sun is already out? Oh, ah, okay! Just one last experiment, and then we can get some rest. Last one, I promise...",

            "Good Morning\tGood morning. Did you sleep well? According to research, not getting a good night's sleep can have detrimental effects on your cognition and stamina. What? I'm always up working through the night? Yeah, I know... Can't be helped I guess...",
            "Good Afternoon\tWaaaaa! No, stay back, don't come over here! No, no, it's nothing personal — it's just that this experiment is highly volatile and might cause an explosion.",

            "About Us: Perks\tTo be honest, I was a little afraid when we first met, because you don't talk much... I thought I must have offended you somehow. But then as time went on, I discovered you're really easy to get along with. Hehe, just an unexpected outcome of my observations.",

I was ahh... also wondering — did Stormterror happen to drop anything during the fight? You know, a scale, some skin — even just a little would be fine. There are some tests I'd like to run...",
            "About the Vision\tMy Vision is my most important research tool. Hmm? Why, without it I'd be unable to proceed with most of my elemental research. Combat? Oh, I suppose I use it for that too when I'm out in the field looking for materials.",
            "Something to Share\tThis room is where I keep all the bones I've collected. On the table on the left we have lizards, frogs, and grass carp.

They're really quite cute once you get used to them.",
            "Interesting Things\tIf you look closely, you'll notice that the Mist Flowers I've planted here are all different. This one is the most powerful, this one blooms the longest... This one?

            "About Noelle\tShe's... a very willing helper, I can't deny that. It's just... she makes me a little anxious is all. One time, she saw three boxes of materials stacked just outside my laboratory door, and proceeded to move them inside for me. A nice gesture, but the thing is... I'd only just finished putting them outside...",
            "About Klee\tJean has put her into solitary confinement so many times, but every time she's let out it's not long before she's back in trouble. *sigh* Something tells me she hasn't done much introspection. I told her I'd make her a bouncing, dancing Jumpy Dumpty that is also safe — but to date there are still a lot of problems with the design.",
            "About Jean\tI don't dare talk to Master Jean that much, because she's so strict. I know she's a good person and all — I know that, I do — but... I still find her scary. I don't tend to bother her, and even when I have to... I ask Albedo to go on my behalf.",
            "About Lisa\tShe really seems to know a great deal. She's obviously never seen my research, and yet on so many occasions she's given me advice on that which is most core to my studies. Just how does she know? Is it observation, or is it ratiocination?",
            "About Kaeya\tOh... I know he likes to joke, and isn't trying to make fun of me, but I often struggle to work out which parts of what he says are the truth and which parts are jokes. So whenever he talks to me, the outcome is usually one of two things: morbid embarrassment or unbearable awkwardness.",
            "About Albedo: Artistry\tAs his assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking. No matter how complex the task at hand, his way of thinking ensures he gets to the bottom of it, and is able to explain it thoroughly. His methodologies are amazing... to me, it's where alchemy meets art.",
            "About Albedo: Talent\tTalent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research — I'd still spend my whole life playing catch up. But, my studying bio-alchemy has nothing to do with evading his line of research, we just happen to have different interests and dreams — nothing more.",
            "About Amber\tI'm curious as to why her doll is called \"Baron Bunny,\" it clearly has nothing to do with a rabbit at all. Oh, the headband makes it look like it has rabbit ears you say? Hmm... That's heavily reliant on the rabbit stereotype, is it not? Many rabbits' ears are floppy.",
            "About Fischl\tI take it you're referring to the book series, Flowers for Princess Fischl? Indeed, the world the author came up with is very creative. If only I could go see it with my own eyes. Oh, you're referring to Fischl herself? I am... doubtful that she could really take me there.",
            "About Eula\tThe role of a scout is a hazardous one, and Ms. Eula throws herself into danger all too easily. So, I made a reconnaissance device for her, so that she wouldn't have to infiltrate enemy camps herself. But Ms. Eula has such an imposing manner, she really puts me on edge, and... I was so nervous that I accidentally left out a few important details while explaining how to use it... As a result, there was an accident...\nAh, what should I do... I hope she won't hold a grudge against me...",
            "More About Sucrose: I\tYou... want to know more about me? You... must have an interest in bio-alchemy, then? Whatever you ask, I will be sure to give you the most precise answer possible. Oh, it really is me specifically that you are interested in? I'm... ahh... oh. I'm at a loss for words.",
            "More About Sucrose: II\tThe essence of research is the process of finding the answer. Sometimes, working through that process can be tedious, but every time I see the cumulative result of my efforts... I know that I'm doing what I love.",
            "More About Sucrose: III\tWhen I was little, I had two good friends — we kept nothing from each other. I thought I knew everything about them, but then... stuff happened, and we grew distant. As for where they are now, what they're doing, whether or not they remember me... I have no idea. Even though we were best friends, things still turned out this way.",
            "More About Sucrose: IV\tLet me tell you a little secret, something I've never told anyone. The purpose behind my research is to create my own wonderland. Yes... just like the ones in fairy tales. The kind where all your dreams come true and you live happily ever after. Hehe, it's childish, isn't it? But, I still believe in fairy tales.",
            "More About Sucrose: V\tIf you're busy, please don't let me stand in the way of progress. ...You're not busy? Really? It's fine, I—I get that you have stuff to do. I'm already quite used to working alone. ...You're truly not busy? I—In that case, I don't suppose you could help me with a few things? Or, you know, we could sit and chat about... stuff.",
            "Sucrose's Hobbies\tI like things that look orderly. See? All of my research notes are compiled in notebooks of the exact same thickness. All my potions are lined up according to effect and hue— Wha—What!? What is this purple potion doing here!? Sorry, I—I need to reassess the order of these potions!",
            "Sucrose's Troubles\tI wonder... What is it that you do in your free time? Every time I get a break, I can never find anything to do. I just find myself staring off into space. Time goes by so quickly when I'm experimenting, so how is it that when I'm not doing anything, the days all feel like years...",
            "Favorite Food\tI extract the nectar from Sweet Flowers to make candy. When I get stuck in a rut, I just pop one in my mouth and my focus returns. Retaining optimal blood sugar levels during research is essential.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tOnce I came to understand more about bio-alchemy, I stopped eating mushrooms. You're no doubt aware? Mushrooms grow on that which has died, which in turn makes me think of other such things, and my appetite just disappears... Blergh...",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tSo delectable! Time to finish my research now that I feel at my best!",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tI must admit, this tastes a lot better than my healthy meals. Time for me to make some modifications to my diet.",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tSucrose may be the assistant of the genius alchemist Albedo, but they could not be more different in research direction.\nAs opposed to studying the essence of alchemy and the ability to create new life, she is far more interested in using alchemy to modify existing life, all the better to add variety and color to this world.\nDespite her youth, she has already achieved some brilliant results. For example, she has been able to increase the nectar output of Sweet Flowers by 70% by irrigating them with a special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows Sunsettias to maintain their freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch.\nEven people who were initially suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field of alchemy after seeing such results.\nHowever, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more ambitious than this.\nIt's a secret, and is also her little dream.",
            "Character Story 1\tBio-alchemy explores numerous lines of inquiry, all of which stem from Sucrose's questions about living things in the world. These questions, in turn, are born out of her insatiable curiosity, a faculty that is far more developed in her than it is in most.\nFor instance, Sucrose's curiosity was once drawn to the sweet flower, accepted by most people as simply being a source of sugar.\nShe wondered: Although sweetness is clearly the most readily identifiable feature of this plant, should that be grounds for limiting its application as we have tended to do? Does it not merit further study?\nSo, after a careful study of the various features of sweet flowers, she devised thirty-something distinct rearing plans along with numerous control groups to account for temperature and other environmental conditions.\nAnd yet, her experiment still underestimated just how many variations were possible. After the experiment began, Sucrose found herself with more questions rather than fewer, and the novel discoveries that her experiment yielded gave her inspiration for further research.\nSucrose is incapable of leaving a question unattended to — it makes her restless, even guilty, to ignore it. Spurred on by this quirk of her temperament, her rearing plans grew in number to almost three hundred.\nThe result was a whole new series of sweet flower strains: Some with thrice the number of flowers, some with heads five or six times the normal size that could even float in the wind, and some even producing a sweet-tasting fruit.\nMonths of experimentation later, Sucrose had finally answered every last one of her questions pertaining to sweet flowers. As she finished writing up her research notes, she let out a long sigh of relief.\nThough she was physically and mentally exhausted, the sight of stack after stack of her bio-alchemical research volumes stretching around three walls of the room gave her a deep sense of joy and satisfaction.",
            "Character Story 2\tTo the people around her, Sucrose comes across as a quiet, introverted alchemist with little interest in the lives of others.\nIn fact, the truth is quite the opposite: Sucrose is fascinated by absolutely everything that exists in the world. The only thing is, she finds the discipline of social interaction to be far more difficult to master than that of alchemy.\nIn alchemy, the process of trial-and-error coupled with a determination to get to the truth is sufficient to bring you to your answer eventually. But with interpersonal relationships, there is the added complication of having to factor in manners, moods, and other unquantifiable variables. To make things worse, there seems to be no room for an approach that relies heavily on making errors.\nHence, Sucrose decided to avoid such variables at all costs and stick to her familiar methods in satisfying her curiosity.\nFor instance, Sucrose had always been curious about whether she and Cat's Tail bartender Diona, both of whom have animal ears, had any shared ancestry.\nIn fact, this was not a private matter, and most people would simply ask the question. But Sucrose was concerned that it would be a sensitive topic — she, for one, did not like people drawing attention to her ears.\nSo, she resorted to the method she knew best: observation.\nFor one whole month, Diona constantly had an unnerving sense that someone was secretly watching her. She assumed that one of the tavern patrons was stalking her, and was none too happy about it.\n\"Similar genome, but ultimately different ancestry. Cat connection merits further study. Note: Unable to obtain bone sample thus far.\"\nThis is the conclusion that Sucrose has jotted down in her notebook based on her findings so far.\nBio-alchemy aside, Sucrose made one further discovery from this episode.\nThat is to say, judging by the pair of cat-ear spectacles she made for herself after the event, it would appear that she has finally come to comprehend a certain uniquely feline variety of cuteness. She is too shy to wear them in public, however, and only puts them on when alone in her room.",
            "Character Story 3\tOnce every three days, Sucrose ventures out into the real world at dusk. To her, these excursions are rare and momentous events.\nOne by one, she visits the butcher's, the Adventurers' Guild, and the Springvale hunters, looking for a material of a very specific kind.\n\"H—Hi... Sorry, I... I'd like, um, the freshest, best-quality b—bones you've got... Yep, the ones with the blood and meat still on.\"\nPeople found her behavior utterly unusual at first, but once they had gotten used to it, they were eager to oblige, even putting the rarest bones aside for her in advance.\nThis was a major bonus for her. Not only was she able to acquire an ample supply of the usual chicken and boar bones, but she also got her hands on a complete lizard skeleton and even a chunk of hilichurl leg bone still bearing fresh blood.\nHer eyes would light up with excitement at the sight of these strange and rare bones. She would thank Katheryne of the Adventurers' Guild profusely, bowing to her over and over.\nAs well as going some way towards satisfying Sucrose's curiosity, she also found new inspiration from piecing new bones together\nMore importantly, collecting skeletons was her hobby, and she was crazy about it.\nOne day, Sucrose happened to overhear a mother attempting to discipline her child:\n\"If you don't do as your told, the scary old lady with the cloth sack over her back will come to your door, go into your room, pick out every bone from your body, and take them away!\"\nSucrose's curiosity compelled her to investigate further. It turned out that this was nothing more than a ghost story used by mothers to shock their children into compliance, and that it had existed long before Sucrose was even born.\nShe breathed a sigh of relief when she found out the truth.\nSoon after this, people noticed that Sucrose had switched her cloth sack for a leather one. Perhaps she did this just because she was shy. Or perhaps it was to avoid arousing suspicion...",
            "Character Story 4\tAs an assistant, Sucrose does everything she can to support Albedo, and even though his alchemical inquiries tend more towards the abstruse, she finds herself learning a lot every time.\nAfter an experiment lasting five straight days and nights came to its end, Albedo noticed that Sucrose was on the brink of collapsing from exhaustion, and organized a mandatory seven-day vacation for her.\nSucrose began her holiday determined to take a proper rest and regain her energy, but from the moment that she woke up on day one she struggled to adjust to the vacation lifestyle.\nFirst things first, let's get some breakfast: fried eggs, sausages, and a cup of coffee. Nothing new to report there. All of these were foods and beverages that she had previously researched, after all.\nNext, she thought, how about a little rest and relaxation in the sun with a good book? Again, nothing new to report: plenty of research shows this to be one of the most effective means of relaxation. There wasn't a book that she hadn't already read, and there wasn't a query that she hadn't already highlighted, looked into, and later annotated for clarification.\nSo then she did some household chores: laundry, dusting, tidying. Check. Once again — nothing new to report. There was nothing to dispute about the fact that a clean and tidy environment is conducive to mental well-being.\nHalf a day in, and Sucrose had not had the occasion to ask \"why\" or \"how\" even once.\nShe was bored, restless, and angsty, and she could not calm herself down.\nShe was desperate to throw herself at a research problem. It didn't matter what it was: She would have happily researched the potted plants on the terrace, even if nothing came of it. Anything just to pass the time.\nBut wherever she looked — the Lamp Grass to her left, the Sweet Flower in front of her, or the Cecilia to her right — all she found were things that she had previously researched in exhaustive detail.\nFinally, she gave up and forced herself to go to sleep. The next day, she reported to the laboratory first thing in the morning.\n\"All day long, you have nothing to research, and nothing to question. That's not rest, it's torture!\"",
            "Character Story 5\tSucrose's childhood was no different from anyone else's in Mondstadt. She had loving parents, she had her best friends. Life was simple, and beautiful.\nHer most enduring childhood memory is a story she once heard about a wonderful paradise.\nSomewhere in a far-flung corner of Teyvat, there was an undiscovered domain with pretty pink flowers the height of a hundred people, teeny-tiny floating fairies flying over all the place, and beautiful unicorns, the pinnacle of perfection.\nSucrose and her two best friends believed that if only they could reach this magical place, they would surely live happily ever after.\nBut time went by, and one of her friends left on a long journey with her adventurer parents, never to return.\nThe other suffered a domestic tragedy: Her father fell ill and passed away, her whole personality changed, and she broke off her friendship with Sucrose. The promise that they had once made to reunite some day in the future no longer meant anything.\nSucrose felt lonelier then than she ever had felt before in her whole life. They hadn't even set eyes on paradise yet, and already her friends were gone...\nWell. Even if they were destined to never meet again, Sucrose was desperate to honor their past friendship in some way. That was when she discovered the existence of alchemy from a book that she was reading.\nSucrose realized: Though she had never had the chance to find the entrance to that wondrous place, she now had the opportunity to be the creator of her own paradise.\nThus began her study of bio-alchemy, and she poured all of her curiosity and passion into it.\nStill, she has never once mentioned the story of paradise and her bygone friendships to anyone else.\nPerhaps one day, when that place she first learned of in a children's storybook finally becomes a reality in the real world, her friends will return.",
            "Mist Flower Project 3, Version 17, Enlargement Trial\tSucrose has a set of strict requirements when it comes to the selection of species for her personal paradise. After experimentation, specimens that are up to standard she tags with \"pass.\"\nAt first, she wanted to give exotic-sounding names to each of her plants, just like in the stories, but whenever she came to try and name something, she found herself completely at a loss for ideas.\nAfter spending so long as a scientist, she insisted on flawless logic even when it came to relatively trivial matters such as naming.\nHer earliest batch of names included the following: \"Grassflower,\" a flower that grows on grass;\n\"Flowergrass,\" a grass that grows beneath flowers;\n\"Multigrassflower,\" a flower that grows on dense grass, and so on and so forth.\nEven such un-paradisiacal names as these would take Sucrose forever to come up with — far longer than the duration of the experiments themselves.\nIn the end, she gave up on naming altogether and simply used the specimen identifiers from her research notes instead. Yes, this meant the names ended up being much longer, but, but...\n...But anyway, Sucrose is the creator of this paradise, so why shouldn't she get to name things any way she wants to?",
            "Vision\tIt was on an afternoon just like any other that Sucrose received her Vision.\nReady to begin her one-hundred-and-fifty-ninth dandelion-seed simmering experiment, she poured her carefully crafted alchemical solution into the cauldron.\nInstantly, the cauldron hit boiling point, and the entire room was filled with steam. Sucrose rushed to the cauldron, anxious to see what new transmutation had occurred this time; in her excitement, she even burned both of her hands on the lip of the cauldron.\nMuch to her disappointment, however, the Dandelion Seeds had once again burned to a crisp. But there was something new there, too: lying there amidst the black Dandelion Seeds was a Vision.\nAnd yet, rather than pouring out the liquid and taking her Vision, she first thought for a moment and then lit the fire up again to continue simmering the contents of the cauldron.\nShe was curious to know what further reactions might occur between Dandelion Seeds and Visions.\nSadly, the experiment ended in failure after three hours of constant simmering.\nStill, there was no denying that she had reaped a great reward from this experiment, for the elemental energy provided by her Vision would become her single greatest asset in her future bio-alchemical endeavors."

            "More About Tartaglia: IV\tComrade, a word of advice: Don't go yelling stupid things in the heat of battle. They might sound good in your head, but if you think about it, they make no sense at all. I'm talking about things like, \"I'm on fire!\" That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs.",

            "Character Details\tDespite holding one of the most senior positions in the Fatui as one of the Eleven Harbingers, Childe very much looks like the young adult that he still is.\nHe is a wolf in sheep's clothing, however, for under the cheerful and confident appearance lies a deadly swordsman.\nHe is the youngest among the Harbingers, but one of the most dangerous among their number.\nThat said, Childe doesn't seem to fit in well with the others.\nAs a fighter first and foremost, he is quite at odds with this organization of deceit and treachery.",
            "Character Story 1\tAs the youngest Harbinger in the history of the Fatui, Childe is hardly bound by convention, and plays by his own rules accordingly.\nThough this lone wolf is not so well-received by his peers and is also at odds with their methods, his cavalier demeanor hides a responsible, watertight meticulousness.\nHe is a proud man of his word. Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it.\nBe it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...\nHe not only keeps his promises, but does so with finesse and surgical precision. As the Harbingers' vanguard, Childe always appears in the vulnerable underbellies of Snezhnaya's enemy states, striking as a conflict is about to erupt.",
            "Character Story 2\tMany myths in Snezhnaya say that Tartaglia has been on the battlefield since he was 14 years old.\nOddly enough, at that young age he already seemed to be a skilled slaughterer with mastery of many forms of martial arts.\nBut more terrifying than his skill in combat was his passion for it.\nPerilous battles would only excite him, and terrifying foes would exhilarate him all the more.\nChilde's arrogance and conceit are derived from honing himself across countless battles, and from unmatched combat experience.\nOn the other hand, because they fret about the way his quarrelsome personality tends to invite unwanted trouble, the other Harbingers constantly try to get him sent on missions to places as far from Snezhnaya as possible, so that they can avoid the fallout.\nThe man is incomprehensibly ever in the eye of the storm, and these unusual experiences have also made him quite the show-off who revels in the praise of others.\nUnlike other members of the Harbingers, who prefer to keep a low profile, Tartaglia will often go to watch public performances — occasionally even becoming part of the show himself.",
            "Character Story 3\tIce fishing has been one of Tartaglia's hobbies since childhood.\nIn those days, he was known neither by the names Tartaglia nor \"Childe,\" as the Fatui call him, but as Ajax, named by his father after some hero's tale. He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes before sitting beside them and tending to their fishing lines.\nThis was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.\nBut whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.\nThese were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.\nSo he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.\nEven after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as \"Childe\" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.\nNo longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train — to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.\nSuch long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance.",
            "Character Story 4\tUnlike what the rest of the world may think, Tartaglia was not born with his exceptional skills in battle.\nBut he would never speak to anyone about that critical, fateful encounter of his...\nWhen he was 14, he fled his monotonous life at home with nothing but a shortsword and a bag of bread in hand.\nThat 14-year-old boy got lost in the snowy forest.\nPursued by bears and wolf packs, he lost his footing and fell into a bottomless crack in the earth's surface.\nThere, he witnessed the endless possibilities of another ancient world. There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...\nOr perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.\nThis darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.\nIn those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.\nNo one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.\nWhen his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.\nThus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.\nThis would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior.",
            "Character Story 5\tBy the time he returned home, the young man was no longer the same.\nHe was no longer frightened and hesitant but had become frivolous and confident. He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.\nConflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.\nIn the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much uncalled-for havoc to the seaside village of Morepesok.\nOr perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow — and he reveled in it.\nUltimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.\nHe hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.\nThis was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of Pulcinella, the 5th Harbinger.\nShocked by Ajax's great strength and curious about how he invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the Tsaritsa.\nHis insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...\nUntil at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of \"Childe\" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.\nBut becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey.",
            "Tartaglia's Letters to Home\t\"Dearest Sister, are you all keeping well at home? Has the old man's headache gotten any better?\nPlease send my regards to our parents and our siblings.\nI've sent some wind chill medication over from Liyue Harbor. It's very effective, and will probably keep him from nagging for a while. It should reach you after a few days.\nApart from our father's affairs, I naturally haven't forgotten about gifts for you all.\nThis letter should come with two kites from Liyue, a rattle drum, two porcelain dolls from Inazuma, and a crate full of various snacks.\nAnd please break it to Anthon that the residents of Liyue are just boring old ordinary humans, like us.\nThey're not made of stone, and they don't even eat stones.\nDo not fret for my sake, Tonia, and refrain from making trouble for anyone at home. I will be home soon. When I have seized the seven stars of Liyue and laid them at the feet of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, I will take the first ship home, just as I promised — and you know how I always keep my promises.\nYours faithfully, Your loyal knight.\"",
            "Delusion\tTartaglia's Delusion is his old badge of honor and the proof of his strength.\nHe still remembers with perfect clarity the day when he received his Delusion and ascended to become a member of the Harbingers.\nAs he stood before the cold, stern Tsaritsa, The Jester, the very first of the Fatui, personally pinned this insignia onto him.\nIt was his reward for slaying many terrible beasts, and a memento of countless battles.\nBut it was not this that brought Tartaglia joy, for honor is the natural reward of the warrior.\nNor did he pay any mind to the odd looks his new \"colleagues\" gave him, for the opinions and bellyaches of others meant nothing to him.\nThe sight of the Tsaritsa on her lofty throne alone stirred the young man's heart with respect and admiration, not merely because she opened the way for him to find an abundance of looming battles, but also because of the way she looked upon him.\nHer gaze was cold but pure, arrogant yet sharp.\nShe was not only the sacrosanct Cryo Archon but also a true warrior.\nThus did Childe, having received his Delusion, swear an oath of fealty to the one and only Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya."

With all the political upheaval, he has to contend with public disquiet on one hand and a bunch of self-serving, degenerate public officials on the other. It's best not to dwell on it. All I can do is make sure to look out for him when he's at home.",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tMilady is in all respects a well-rounded person: erudite, compassionate, well-mannered, and elegant... The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more.

            "About Shikanoin Heizou\tHo, that guy is a detective for the Tenryou Commission. He seems to have his own way of doing things — not the easiest person to get along with. Also...

            "More About Thoma: II\tI'm not from Inazuma originally — I think I've told you that before, right? I took a boat all the way here from Mondstadt, found I liked the place, and was also lucky enough to meet the wonderful Kamisato siblings, so I just ended up staying.",
            "More About Thoma: III\tI get homesick once in a while, too, so I completely relate to all the international merchants on Ritou. I try to look out for them as much as I can. The difference between us is that they see themselves as just passing by, and have no intention of trying to integrate here. And because that's how they think, it becomes their reality. The majority of Inazumans will never see them as anything more than outsiders.",
            "More About Thoma: IV\tFor some of the more conservatively minded people in Inazuma, the idea of an outlander working as a retainer for one of the Commissions is unthinkable. So there was a time when I was not that welcome here. I'm pretty sure I'd have been deported a long time ago without a couple of Kamisatos fighting my corner. I couldn't let the clan down after they'd been so kind to me, so I put in a lot of honest work, and eventually, everyone was finally able to accept me.",
            "More About Thoma: V\tI'm not sure if I should get into this, but... Ah, hopefully you won't mind. I went through a period where I really just wanted to go home — Mondstadt is my homeland, after all. But I was torn... It wouldn't be easy to leave Inazuma behind, either. I mean, just look how good the people here have been to me. The Kamisato Clan always has a room for me, and there are people I've met here that are like family. So, I went back and forth over it, and ultimately decided I'd stay in Inazuma. When I'm missing Mondstadt... I can just chat with you. You don't mind my rambling, do you?",
            "Thoma's Hobbies\tI've been really getting into stories about the unnatural recently. Especially ones about shapeshifting youkai — they're so fascinating.

            "Thoma's Troubles\tI'm in a real pickle here. The chief is hosting a banquet for his friends tonight, and he says he wants me to splurge a little by cooking some Butter Crab. The only problem is that for the last two days, I haven't been able to buy crab anywhere! So, what, am I gonna have to dive into the ocean and grab them myself?",
            "Favorite Food\tWithout a doubt, my favorite food is Rice Cake Soup. I like cooking up a big, delicious potful for everyone to share. It's a recipe for a good time.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tAs far as food is concerned, I'm fine with anything. If we're counting beverages, though... I'm not very good with alcohol. Don't laugh, and before you say it — yes, I've wondered what this says about my identity as a Mondstadter. But, y'know... too much alcohol is bad for you, anyway. So not drinking is a good thing.",

            "Character Details\tThoma's official title in the Kamisato Clan is that of a \"housekeeper,\" and as such, he is responsible for matters such as cleaning and cooking.\nWhenever he appears at the Yashiro Commission, Thoma is almost always busy with such work. He is able to get everything done well, and even Furuta, the butler of the Kamisato Clan, is full of praise for his housekeeping skills.\nHowever, most of the time, Thoma does not stay in the Yashiro Commission, but goes elsewhere to deal with some special matters discreetly.\nFor example: solving the problems encountered by the Yashiro Commission, asking for information for the head of the Kamisato Clan, fulfilling Ayaka's wishes, etc.\nIn those unknown corners, Thoma has always used his own way to develop the influence of the Yashiro Commission.",
            "Character Story 1\tThoma seems to have been born with a good temper.\nRegardless of whether he's dealing with a dignitary or a street vendor, Thoma can easily find an opening to join the conversation and have a good time with them.\nThoma, who is good at socializing, has a wide range of contacts in Inazuma. When he first arrived in Inazuma, he relied on his insight and communication skills to make friends with people in various industries. Later, many people would take the initiative to get to know Thoma.\nThe more people you know, the more resources you can get. Thoma would learn a lot of first-hand information from them, or quietly strike \"deals\" that are beneficial to the Yashiro Commission.\nHowever, although Thoma has a vast network of contacts, he has never used it for personal gain, nor has he ever forced others to do things in the name of the Yashiro Commission.\nSociability, precise judgment, and just the right amount of tact. Perhaps this is the reason why Thoma can thrive as a \"fixer\" in Inazuma.",
            "Character Story 2\tSurprisingly, the handsome and cheerful Thoma has no resistance when it comes to cute animals.\nWhen Thoma's out, he always carries some small snacks for animals, and feeds stray cats and dogs when he sees them.\nIt never fails to make him smile seeing animals scarf food down.\nTo Thoma, these animals, like himself, are part of what makes up the world.\nEven if they don't seem to be eye-catching, they are still trying to live.\nAs long as you live, good things will always happen... This is what Thoma has always believed in.\nEven if these animals had not encountered good things before, he hoped that at least his presence would be a good thing worth celebrating for.",
            "Character Story 3\tAs the housekeeper of the Kamisato Clan, Thoma is an \"all-rounder\" when it comes to housekeeping.\nWhether it's cleaning, cooking, sewing, gardening, caregiving, or socializing, he can handle it all with ease.\nFor Thoma, housekeeping is not only a job and duty, but also his hobby.\nHe would clean the house like new, making sure that there was not a single grain of dust left on the railings. He would be in a very happy mood when faced with a clean and tidy Yashiro Commission.\nPerhaps it's the sense of accomplishment that comes with cleaning. Whenever he has the chance, Thoma will pick up a broom or duster and sweep away any unsightly stains.\nIn addition, he also takes special care of the daily lives of his colleagues around him.\nThere was a winter when Inazuma's temperature suddenly dipped, and a guard of the Yashiro Commission accidentally caught a cold while out on patrol. A few days later, he unexpectedly received a sweater hand-knitted by Thoma.\nThe sweater that was just the right size made the guard think back to the clothes he received from his mother every winter. Now that his mother was old, she hadn't sent him clothes for many years.\nWith this in mind, the guard took a long leave of absence to visit his family. The day he came back, he brought Thoma a special souvenir from his hometown, and they became good friends.",
            "Character Story 4\tThoma's father is an Inazuman and his mother is a Mondstadter.\nThoma grew up in Mondstadt and has been accustomed to its carefree and happy atmosphere since he was young. Influenced by this, he can easily mingle with anyone.\nHowever, he has also been taught by his father since he was a child and places great importance on the word \"loyalty\".\nAfter Thoma's father returned to Inazuma, he was worried that his old man would not be able to drink Mondstadt's wine there, so he sailed to Inazuma alone in a boat carrying Dandelion Wine.\nOn the way, a huge wave overturned the boat and Thoma fell into the water. Fortunately, he just drifted unconscious down the water until he got washed ashore on a beach in Inazuma.\nAt that time, Thoma had nothing and no family with him, but still started his life in Inazuma with optimism.\nHowever, despite his best efforts, he was unable to find his father, who was supposed to be in Inazuma.\nBut at his most difficult moment, Thoma met someone in Inazuma who was worthy of his \"loyalty\" to the end.",
            "Character Story 5\tDue to his hailing from Mondstadt, Thoma is often regarded as an \"outsider\" by the local residents of Inazuma.\nDespite the strange looks and gossip directed towards him, Thoma never showed any dissatisfaction, and always smiled at all doubts.\nThoma is recognized as the most amiable person in the Yashiro Commission, but to outsiders, it is another story.\n\"Don't offend Thoma! Otherwise, things will be difficult to handle.\"\nNo one is sure when it started, but this saying has gone around so much that many people are convinced of this when they hear it.\nAs for those who have had unpleasant run-ins with Thoma, the mention of him still instills fear:\n\"Don't be fooled by that guy! He's always smiling kindly, but all I did was cheat the Yashiro Commission out of a small sum of money, and he...\"\nThat's right, if anyone dares to harm the interests of the Yashiro Commission or disrespect the Kamisato siblings, Thoma will make them pay.\nHe sees this as his duty and does his best, but does not like to boast about his achievements. Even if he is criticized for this, he will not defend himself too much.\n\"Gee, who cares about such trivialities? And it doesn't matter what kind of person I am, as long as those who should know know it.\"",
            "Old Duster\tThoma's favorite duster has been with him in many \"conquests\".\nAs it has been used for too long, no matter how Thoma cleans and takes care of it now, it still looks old and gray. Despite this, Thoma is still reluctant to discard it.\nThis duster was given to Thoma when he was first assigned cleaning duties at Yashiro Commission. As soon as he sees it, he recalls those hard but happy times.\nAt that time, Thoma had yet to comprehend various cleaning techniques. Due to his lack of experience, he was often busy doing all kinds of cleaning and tidying work until late at night.\nAccompanying him were the moonlight above his head, the chirping of insects in the summer night, and the sound of a duster tapping on the beams.\nThere are many different kinds of cleaning. From a simple cleaning to an all-out deep cleaning, Thoma has experienced it all.\nAt first, he found the work boring, but after he got used to it, he found that he could think more quietly when cleaning.\nSo to this day, Thoma often uses this duster to perform his work.\nWhile brushing away the dust in front of him, he also brushed away the fog in his head in a quiet and steady state of mind.",
            "Vision\tIn his early years living in Mondstadt, Thoma did not have particularly strong aspirations.\nEach day, he was awakened by the early morning sun and the fresh fragrance of flowers. After breakfast, he could choose to take a relaxing stroll through the city or explore the wilderness freely.\nAt that time, Thoma thought that people should have the happiness of living a leisurely life. Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.\nThis calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.\nHere, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of \"repayment\" arose.\nTen years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.\nKamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:\n\"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase. You are someone who can see what's at stake, so if you don't want to get involved, leave early.\"\nCould Thoma, who had received so many favors from the Kamisato Clan, just leave like that? Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.\nThe storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.\nBut after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:\n\"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady. You will certainly need me as a helper in the path you embark on in the future.\"\nThe will to burn for loyalty and righteousness forged a strong desire that drew the attention of the gods.\nAs if to respond to Thoma's choice — on this night of divergent destinies, a Vision, bright red like a blaze, appeared beside him."

            "Character Details\tThose who travel through Avidya Forest will sometimes meet a rather special Forest Watcher.\nHe has large ears, a long tail, and a slightly delicate face. If a less discerning eye were to appraise him, he might even look like some kind of small, rare animal native to the forests.\nBut anyone who has ever been acquainted with him will know that there is clarity to his words and steadiness in his bearing.\n\"One moment, please. Judging from your equipment, you're a traveling merchant bound for Sumeru City, aren't you? Come back, please, you're going the wrong way.\"\n\"I mean, just look over there. The leaves are dense and the air grows damper. That doesn't seem like the main road leading to the city, no matter how you slice it.\"\n\"Oh dear, your waterskin is empty, isn't it?\"\n\"Come, let me share some with you. Being in a rainforest is no reason to skimp on your water supply.\"\n\"If you drink any old water you find out here, you might next find yourself at Bimarstan, you know?\"\n\"Of course, if that is part of your itinerary, then I suppose you have... interesting opinions.\"\nAmidst the flurry of instructions, the lost lamb will have all the arrangements made for them before they know it.\n\"Um... Thank you so much! Still, uh, might I ask who you are...?\"\nAs the other Forest Rangers look upon the traveling merchant bowing to the diminutive Forest Watcher, they cannot help but laugh.\n\"Pfft-haha! Ahem. This is our G— Well, Forest Watcher Tighnari.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tOther than the most basic of forest maintenance, the Forest Rangers will often encounter a great number of problems whose origins lie in human hands:\nArbitrarily occupied camps, shacks built by the destruction of vegetation, domestic waste dumps that may become sources of pollution, bonfire embers that have yet to fully be extinguished...\nIn response to such situations, they must not only solve the problem at hand but also try to admonish the perpetrators, and yet these exhortations are not always accurately communicated.\nThis would improve greatly after Tighnari joined the Forest Watchers.\nPart of this is his scholarly rigor — the way in which he will unceremoniously \"teach\" the troublemakers.\nBut more importantly, Tighnari is able to communicate the correct way to act and the reasons behind that in a manner most comprehensible to those he teaches.\nThe way he sees it, these crafts of living out in the wilds are also knowledge, and getting people to accept knowledge is an art in and of itself.\nIt is far more useful to be straightforward about the other part's errors and what is at stake as opposed to dryly giving advice.\nThis is also why Tighnari has disagreements with the Akademiya's purveying of the Akasha Terminal.\nKnowledge is, in truth, the treasure of all living things. It should be passionately embraced by those who are curious about it as opposed to becoming a tool for survival, doled out in limited amounts.\nUnfortunately, as a young researcher, Tighnari did not have anywhere near the clout to stand against the Akademiya, and even now he can only do what he can in a limited capacity.\nAt the same time, reality does not quite match up to one's ideals—\nAs such, some unlucky soul getting lectured by Tighnari is no uncommon sight in Avidya Forest.",
            "Character Story 2\tWhen Tighnari first arrived at Gandharva Ville, he was still a normal member of the Forest Rangers, no different from any other Forest Watcher.\n\"Rather than taking part in all these babbling debates about all these 'big ideas,' I might as well change the forest for the better in a practical manner, using what I’ve learned.\"\n—This was how Tighnari originally felt when he first joined the Forest Rangers, a fresh graduate from the Amurta school who had parted ways with the Akademiya.\nBut he soon discovered that the Forest Rangers had significant problems of their own.\nThey were passionate about protecting the forest, yes, but the organization as a whole lacked rational structure and instruction with any measure of scientific rigor.\nAlas, change could never come without any difficulty, and yet Tighnari was never good at leaving things to rot.\nAs such, the highly active Tighnari leapt into action to turn things around.\nHe created a rationalized forest patrol log, assigned tasks according to each person’s strengths, and regularly conducted natural history training for his fellow team members...\nWith the enthusiastic cooperation of his fellow rangers, the forest patrols around Avidya Forest grew ever more effective, especially around Gandharva Ville, where it could be said to be perfect.\nNaturally, this knowledgeable and highly active researcher would become someone whom the Forest Rangers looked up to.\nOne day, Tighnari would discover that he had a new name amongst his colleagues.\n\"Hey there, General Watchleader! Could you look over the journal entry I wrote for today?\"\n\"General Watchleader! I’ve found some baggage down in the Chinvat Ravine. I've placed at the lost and found section.\"\n\"Oh no, where has Sag gone... Um, General Watchleader, have you seen it around?\"\nHe at first took this for slips of the tongue, but many recurrences later, this sign would see his brows burrow.\n\"Do we actually have that rank? Or are we going for something similar to 'General Mahamatra'?\"\nWhatever the case, Tighnari would eventually prevail upon everyone to go back to calling him \"Forest Watcher,\" \"Master,\" or \"Mr. Tighnari.\"\n\"I'm afraid 'General Watchleader' is too great a title for me to bear,\" or so he said.\n\"Heh, that actually reminded me of a joke someone once told about the title of 'General Mahamatra'...\"\nHe did not make mention of this other reason for his refusal of that title.",
            "Character Story 3\tThere was a time when a certain vibrantly-colored flower was all the rage amongst the people of Sumeru. Many people would buy it to adorn their houses, and thus it gradually became a trend.\nUnfortunately, this flower was not long for the world if removed from the rainforest, and would only last two days at best if so plucked.\nFlowers that were no longer fresh would soon be discarded, left by the wayside to rot — a shame by any standard of imagination.\nThis could not go on. Never mind the garbage or pollution-related issues, this trend ran the risk of damaging the forest ecosystem if it persisted long enough.\nHowever, just as the Forest Rangers were mulling over this problem, Tighnari would send out an offer of cooperation with the flower sellers in the city:\nThe Forest Rangers would help them gather fresh flowers for free, but that they should provide an additional service, informing those who came to purchase the flowers that if they sent them back by the second day, they would obtain a receipt that could then be exchanged within the next 3 days for a dried flower decoration.\nThese decorations were of course provided by Tighnari and the Forest Rangers. The option to pay for them and how much to pay would be left up to the buyer of the flowers, just as things might go at a charity bazaar.\nPart of this Mora would go to the store owner as service charge for collecting the leftover flowers, and the rest would be used for funding the Forest Rangers' efforts to maintain the rainforest.\nThis cooperation went quite smoothly indeed. The flower shop owners saved themselves the trouble of searching deep within the rainforest for their floral quarry and got some extra income; the Forest Rangers got to control the process and amount of flowers gathered, and also got some extra funds; those who bought flowers would not only receive a temporary flower as a companion, but also a more permanent memento.\nThis all went quite swimmingly, but some rangers did not understand, asking: \"Why didn't we just ban the gathering of such flowers in the first place? Wouldn't that have been simpler?\"\nTighnari shook his head when he heard this answer, causing his ears to shake.\n\"We shouldn't make such simple calculations. If we were to force our requests through, we would be just like a stolid lecturer who fails to have others understand, but who stirs up feelings of rebellion instead.\"\n\"If that were to happen, our reputation would be the least of our woes — we would have our hands full trying to deal with those who were coming to pick flowers illegally!\"\n\"In any case, trends will change. Don't worry. I'm sure the people's attention will shift to something else soon.\"\nPragmatic as these words were, they quickly found traction with the Forest Rangers. Collei's nods were particularly rapid.\n\"The dried flower decorations that Master taught us to make have been pretty popular with the children, too!\"",
            "Character Story 4\tBeings of Tighnari's race are a rare and unpredictable sort, and usually give off the impression of being loners.\nBut Tighnari's circumstances appear to have been somewhat different.\nAlthough he has spent much time meditating on his research and has spent comparatively little on cultivating relationships, he did wind up stumbling into a good number of comrades nonetheless.\nTighnari had excellent grades in the Akademiya early on, and many would come to him for help with their coursework. When his seminar courses would end, he would often go along with requests for group photos.\nNot that he really understood them, but he agreed anyway.\nThat was how \"Tighnari knows everything, and he's so nice to talk to!\" became a widespread saying, causing many to fight for his time. Even students from other Darshans would want to collaborate with him.\nThis went on till one day, when his popularity also attracted the attention of the General Mahamatra Cyno—\nForming factions and gathering forces... these were nothing if not the harbingers of academic corruption!\nYet with some time spent observing Tighnari, Cyno found that the former had only received people out of the goodness of his heart.\nTighnari himself only really had eyes for his work, and was dispassionate concerning the offers of others.\nCertainly he would agree to collaborate, but only in the interests of furthering his research in the best way possible.\nUltimately, Cyno's judgment was as such: \"This is an upright and reliable talent who has no questionable dealings. Threat resolved.\"\nIt was perhaps due to this pure impression that the General Mahamatra, known for distancing himself from scholarship and scholars alike, would let down his guard and become friends with Tighnari in the days to come.\nThese factors would all culminate in yet another meeting with another comrade.\n\"This young lady's name is Collei?\"\n\"It's okay if you can't read or write. We all start having no knowledge — in this you are no different from anyone else.\"\n\"Shall we start with writing your name, then?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tAll who love research share the enjoyment of performing that research and a curiosity for the unknown.\nThis is also true of Tighnari, and indeed, his curiosity seems to have been with him since birth.\nWhile children his age were still reading fairy tales, Tighnari was already flipping through crates and shelves in his parents' study.\nFrom his father, who studied insects, he would take general textbooks, and from his paleontologist mother, he would borrow some images of fossils.\nThus did Tighnari absorb all this knowledge, whether he understood it or not, while hugging his tail.\nSlowly, however, he found that as his knowledge increased, the unknowns that he wished to explore also grew more numerous.\nFor example, why were other people born without ears and tails like that of his family?\nFlipping through all the ancient tomes he could find in his home, Tighnari discovered a manuscript left behind by an ancestor of his that concerned \"Valuka Shuna.\"\nAs the records claimed, Valuka Shuna were a race subject to King Deshret, and who dwelled in the vast desert, mostly possessing light-colored fur and large ears that were excellent at dissipating heat.\nLater, calamity would descend and destroy King Deshret's realm, with the Valuka Shuna only surviving due to the grace of the Dendro Archon, which turned their fur green.\n\"It is worth noting that while Valuka Shuna were noted to have been more like foxes, the meaning of their name was 'large desert dog.'\"\n\"According to a human friend of mine who has a very close relationship with the forest, it was a little creature known as an Aranara that gave them this name.\"\n\"Oh my,\" Young Tighnari thought in shock, \"so I'm a 'large desert dog!'\"\nTo be more precise, it was the fact that his ancestors had lived alongside the Valuka Shuna that they did end up inheriting some of their traits.\nBut of course, such technicalities were of no importance to an excited child. Thus did Tighnari immediately ask his father to bring him — the 'large desert dog' — back to the desert to have a look on his next surveying trip.\nUnfortunately, they met with an accident. Not a few meters into the desert, Tighnari fell into a faint from the heat and had to be rushed back to the rainforest.\n\"Oh no,\" Tighnari thought sadly as he convalesced in his treehouse, \"the 'large desert dogs' have devolved in my generation.\"\nMany years later, the ignorant child had become a reliable researcher, and this event had become a joke consigned to the past.\nNowadays, Tighnari not only knows why those little Aranara gave them this name, but also why he faints easily from the desert heat.\nThe former is simple. Foxes and dogs are, biologically speaking, both canines, so the Aranara might have viewed them as interchangeable.\nAs for the latter, though Tighnari is loath to admit it, it probably had something to do with what his father said then as he tousled his hair.\n\"This lad's fur is an intensely dark shade of green. He's going to have trouble in the desert heat for sure!\"",
            "Researcher's First Magnifying Glass\tWhen little Tighnari would explore alone in the rainforest, he would carry a magnifying glass with him.\nThat was a gift from his mother. Light and cogent in design, it could immediately be recognized as a tool suited for children.\n\"Your ears can already help you hear sounds from reeeaaally far away, so let this magnifying glass help you see smaller things!\"\nThus did Tighnari use this device to see the veins on the back of leaves, the powder that hung off butterfly wings, and the trails of the rainforest snakes...\nIt was through this gradual observation, collection, and consideration that he was eventually admitted into Amurta early, beginning his official learning journey under the Sage there.\nTighnari placed the magnifying glass, scarred and weathered by many years of use, on top of his brand new invitation letter, placed his hands on his cheeks, and thought for a good long while.\nFinally, he had this constant companion of his converted into an ornament that he might wear on his person.\nHe knew that once he entered the Akademiya, he would study more complex books and access more marvelous instruments, and that there was little place for this old beginner's magnifying glass.\nHowever, it would always be his companion in his search for knowledge, and would follow him to see lands wider and vaster still.",
            "Vision\tAcademic conferences are unavoidable at the Akademiya, no matter whether one is here to learn or work.\nThose at the podium will wax lyrical, and those in the audience will give their support. This sight is most commonplace at such conferences.\nBut strictly speaking, what researcher, adrift amidst the vast sea of information, will not make mistakes in their investigations?\nAt one such conference that Tighnari attended, one speaker spoke of things that Tighnari knew to be untrue.\nThen, he was just a bystander and a listener. Glancing around his surroundings almost subconsciously, he noticed that neither his classmates nor his teachers had said anything.\nWhat should he do? Perhaps everyone indeed knew what the problem was, but did not want to make the speaker lose face.\nOr perhaps he was the only one who had noticed the problem, and his silence now would cause misinformation to spread...\nBut Tighnari did not hesitate long before steeling himself.\nThough both his status and the scene were obstacles in his path, the rigor of knowledge eventually won out.\nAfter all, knowledge was like a star blazing through the night sky. Nothing would divert its path.\nSo thinking, Tighnari raised his hand—\n\"My apologies. If I may interject—\"\nThe researcher onstage was at first a bit shocked to hear his gentle voice, but reacted swiftly and invited him to elaborate.\nAs it turned out, Tighnari had done the right thing.\nThe speaker, after having processed enough of the information, accepted his corrections earnestly.\nAnd once their exchange had ended, other students and teachers in attendance would also speak in their turn, leading to new research angles opening up for the topics discussed at the conference. Tighnari himself would also receive namecards from some well-known researchers.\nOnce the whole incident was over, Tighnari would heave a sigh of relief.\nThat was a fortunate... No, indeed, a joyous thing that those who studied alongside him also accorded knowledge the gravitas it deserved.\nBut he had not yet counted on something still more fortunate and joyous to occur.\nWhen the meeting ended and Tighnari stood to leave, he heard a crisp, clear \"clink!\"\n—Lo and behold, a Vision rolled off his garments onto the chair below."

Care to give an example?\nPaimon: Uh... \"Windrise's winds never churn.\"\n{NICKNAME}: ...Um, \"But the Sea of Clouds' clouds always return.\"\nPaimon: Huh... Not bad!\nPaimon: Let's not waste time here. We've got some money to make!",
            "About \"Don't Play With Food, or With Money\"\tPaimon: There's a saying of Rex Lapis' that's commonly used here in Liyue. Paimon thinks its rough meaning is... \"Don't play with your money.\"\nPaimon: It's because the first Mora were minted from his golden form and given to humans in trust.\n{NICKNAME}: Heh, Kaeya sure seems to enjoy playing with his money...\nPaimon: And that's why you shouldn't learn from him.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, as a child, I was taught not to play with my food.\nPaimon: Yup, yup. You've got to respect your food.\nPaimon: ...Wh—What are you looking at Paimon for?",
            "About Heart's Desire\tPaimon: Walk in seven clockwise circles, then walk in seven anticlockwise circles, then open your eyes...\n{NICKNAME}: Are you sleepwalking?\nPaimon: Nope! Paimon is just trying to see if that antique shop from \"Heart's Desire\" actually exists!\n{NICKNAME}: Well, assuming that a shop in a story does exist, what would you like to buy, Paimon?\nPaimon: A Slime Creator!\n{NICKNAME}: Does such a thing even exist?",
            "About the Guhua Clan\t{NICKNAME}: Lately, some Guhua Clan disciples have been retelling an ancient story.\nPaimon: The Guhua Clan, huh? Paimon bets it's a heroic story!\n{NICKNAME}: Several male disciples decided to partake of a contest of arms to see who would marry their female junior, and she approved.\nPaimon: Ooh, Paimon's heard this one. In Liyue, they call this \"a joust for a spouse\"!\n{NICKNAME}: But the night before the contest, she stole the eldest disciple's favorite sword.\nPaimon: Ah, so she wanted him to lose... Poor guy...\n{NICKNAME}: I know, right? Forced to use a sword he wasn't used to, the eldest disciple suffered a crushing defeat.\n{NICKNAME}: Unable to accept this result, he fell to his knees and wept.\nPaimon: Oh no... He must have really loved her, right?\n{NICKNAME}: In the end, he was forced to... marry her in front of everyone.\nPaimon: Wait... so the loser had to marry her!?",
            "About Dihua Marsh\tPaimon: Did you know the reeds in Dihua Marsh are common materials used in making paper?\nPaimon: The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes. It's all very sophisticated.\nPaimon: Over the years, many heroes and swordsmen have also chosen Dihua Marsh as the location of their duels.\nPaimon: The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep...\nPaimon: So there are a lot of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...\n{NICKNAME}: And what's my takeaway from all of this supposed to be?\nPaimon: Don't get into a fight in Dihua Marsh!",
            "About the Gentleman Bird\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that in Liyue, people call the crane the \"gentleman bird.\"\n{NICKNAME}: And do you know why that is?\nPaimon: Hmm... Paimon's not quite sure...\n{NICKNAME}: Well then, let me tell you the story of the lucky crane repaying its debts.\n{NICKNAME}: A long, long time ago, there was a kind-hearted scholar who saved a lucky crane that had fallen into a trap.\n{NICKNAME}: Later, on a cold winter's night, a beautiful maiden came to his door, asking to lodge with him.\n{NICKNAME}: The maiden shouldered a greatsword on her back, and taught all that she knew of swordsmanship to the scholar, supervising him as he studied day and night.\nPaimon: Whoa...\n{NICKNAME}: Once he had finished his training, he went out into the wilds with the maiden to do good and fight for justice.\n{NICKNAME}: Ten years later, the lucky crane took the form of a gentleman, and finally came to return the favor, but discovered the couple had already lived out a fortuitous life...\n{NICKNAME}: And that is the story known as \"The Gentleman's 10-Year Debt.\"\nPaimon: Ahh...",
            "About Jueyun Karst\t{NICKNAME}: Rumor has it that Jueyun Karst is the abode of the adepti.\nPaimon: Wow — the abode of the adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps we'll meet the adepti on those cloud-piercing mountain peaks.\nPaimon: Wow — meeting adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: But I wonder, how would one normally communicate with the adepti?\nPaimon: Wow — communicating with adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm. My emergency rations seem to be going bad. Best to consume them quickly...\nPaimon: Ahem. Well... Paimon thinks that shouting from the mountaintop should work.\n{NICKNAME}: That seems more like a way of getting the attention of a hilichurl, rather than an adeptus.",
            "About the God of Contracts\t{NICKNAME}: To think that the Geo Archon had signed a contract with the Cryo Archon.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder what the contents of their agreement were...\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't care who you are, making a deal with the Tsaritsa is super dangerous!\n{NICKNAME}: Be that as it may...\n{NICKNAME}: Since Morax is the god who understands the basis of contracts the best...\n{NICKNAME}: He's definitely given this some thought.\nPaimon: Well that's true. Morax himself called it the \"contract to end all contracts\"...\n{NICKNAME}: I trust that we will witness the truth, and its denouement, play out...",
            "About Divine Predictions in Liyue\tPaimon: Come to think of it, while Rex Lapis enjoys visiting his people in private, he only descends officially once every year.\nPaimon: None of the other gods do this. Hmm... Does Rex Lapis have any deeper intentions?\n{NICKNAME}: I have my guesses...\n{NICKNAME}: You see, those annual divine predictions have already captured the hearts of the people of Liyue too much.\n{NICKNAME}: Round and around they analyze and scrutinize every single word, finding limitless \"hidden meanings\" within them...\n{NICKNAME}: What do you think would happen to Liyue if such predictions were available every day?\nPaimon: Ah!\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now. Paimon would be offering Rex Lapis' favorite snacks to him every day!\nPaimon: If you could just get Mora straight from Morax's hands, who would ever need to do a day of honest work?\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... you made... some logical leaps, but that's basically how it is.",
            "About Benny's Adventure Team\tPaimon: If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared.\nPaimon: Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double- and triple-check your supplies in advance.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of 463 different ways of dying in these domains...\nPaimon: If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Why am I the only one dying here?\nPaimon: Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid 322 causes of death just by floating!\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains...",
            "About Bennett\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that Albert, being the leader of Barbara's fan club...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Sometimes gets bumps and bruises on purpose so he can go to the Cathedral to see her.\nPaimon: Paimon feels the Knights of Favonius should keep a closer watch on weirdos like that.\n{NICKNAME}: But it seems that a month later, Albert discovered that Bennett was managing to see Barbara far more than he was.\n{NICKNAME}: Well... Bennett does have the natural advantage when it comes to getting injured, after all.\nPaimon: What is this, a \"let's bother Barbara\" contest?",
            "About the \"Idol\"\tPaimon: Barbara's really popular, isn't she?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, she is the idol of the people of Mondstadt.\nPaimon: Come to think of it... Paimon doesn't really know what an \"idol\" is.\n{NICKNAME}: It's an occupation in which one's work is to be cute, be well-loved, and earn a boat-load of Mora.\nPaimon: Isn't that the same thing as being a mascot?\n{NICKNAME}: That's... heh, one way to put it.",
            "About Being Sisters\t{NICKNAME}: Lisa and Amber feel a bit like sisters.\nPaimon: Huh? Why's that?\n{NICKNAME}: Amber often runs errands for Lisa. Older siblings asking their younger siblings to do things for them so that they can slack off is a rather common practice...\n{NICKNAME}: But my sister and I are the same age, so we had to decide these things via rock-paper-scissors.\nPaimon: Whoa. So, doesn't that make you my younger brother?\n{NICKNAME}: What do you mean?\nPaimon: Well, since Paimon floats, you're the only one who can \"run\" any errands!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Seriously?",
            "About Kaeya's Eye Patch\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, have you ever seen what Kaeya looks like under that eye patch?\nPaimon: Nope.\n{NICKNAME}: So, it would seem he never takes it off...\nPaimon: Actually, Paimon already knows why!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh?\nPaimon: He must be hiding some big secret!\n{NICKNAME}: Really, a secret?\nPaimon: See, Kaeya heads out for assignments more than anyone else.\nPaimon: So the skin under that eye patch has to be way lighter than the rest of him.\n{NICKNAME}: So... if he ever takes that eye patch off...\nPaimon: He'll definitely become the butt of everyone's jokes. Maybe he'll even get a weird nickname!\nPaimon: Like, say, \"Pasty Eye\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Guess he didn't need to take it off to get a weird nickname...",
            "About Kaeya and Diluc\tPaimon: Strange...\n{NICKNAME}: What's wrong?\nPaimon: Diluc and Kaeya are really alike, so why don't they get along?\n{NICKNAME}: How are they alike, again?\nPaimon: Well, Kaeya's the kind of guy who acts shady in the light of day...\nPaimon: While Diluc is a shining beacon of justice in the dark of night!\nPaimon: Don't you think that's kinda the same thing...?\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I still don't see it.",
            "About Measuring Fighting Strength\t{NICKNAME}: If one hilichurl could beat, say, three wild boars...\n{NICKNAME}: Then how many hilichurls would it take to reach the fighting prowess of Master Jean and Master Diluc?\nPaimon: Not sure... but if you heard the way everyone talks in Mondstadt, you'd know that Master Jean is the strongest.\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I'd say that if Diluc strikes first, Master Jean wouldn't be able to counter.\nPaimon: Oh, she'd find a way.\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way.\nPaimon: Master Jean's Elemental Burst is really strong, you know~\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that \"field\" would also make Diluc stronger.\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't think Master Jean would even need her Vision to take on Master Diluc, because—\n{NICKNAME}: Diluc would only need a beginner's greatsword to—\nPaimon: Argh...\n{NICKNAME}: Ugh...\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* ...This is so dumb.\n{NICKNAME}: They both fight for Mondstadt, so they wouldn't come to blows.\nPaimon: That's why Paimon likes your idea of measuring their fighting strength in number of hilichurls.\nPaimon: ...Or in Paimon's case, in fifths of a wild boar.",
            "About Razor\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you know what a brush is, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Of course! Kinda like pens but with animal hair at one end for calligraphy, right?\nPaimon: That's correct! They say that finely-made brushes sell for high prices among Liyue's merchants!\n{NICKNAME}: So, would you like to make some too?\nPaimon: Uh-huh! But wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!\nPaimon: Razor's fur is all downy and soft. It'll definitely make great wolf-fur brushes! We could make lots of Mora like this!\n{NICKNAME}: Brushes made like that would conduct electricity. I'm not sure we could use them.\n{NICKNAME}: Besides, Razor isn't a wolf, nor are wolf-fur brushes made from actual wolves' fur...\nPaimon: Huh? Why are they called wolf-fur brushes, then?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?\nPaimon: Hmm. You have a point.",
            "About Klee\tPaimon: Klee's a really interesting kid.\nPaimon: All the Knights seem to like her a lot, too. You could even say they spoil her.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder who makes the better mascot: Paimon or Klee?\n{NICKNAME}: Oh wait, I forgot. Paimon's not a mascot, Paimon's emergency—\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon knows exactly what you're going to say. That joke stopped being funny a long time ago.",
            "About the \"Wondermaid\"\tPaimon: It's time for Paimon's Little Life Tips!\n{NICKNAME}: \"Little Life Tips\"?\nPaimon: In Mondstadt, if there's something you can't fix, or there's something you can't get clean no matter what you do...\nPaimon: If you ever run into something you can't handle yourself, you just need to shout this name into the skies:\nPaimon: \"Noeeeelle!\"\nPaimon: And everything that's troubling you will be swept away in an instant.\n{NICKNAME}: So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt... Pretty impressive...",
            "About Fischl\tPaimon: Fischl makes a very unique impression, doesn't she?\n{NICKNAME}: How so?\nPaimon: Well, she travels together with a talking raven, for starters.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm traveling with you. It's not all that different.\n{NICKNAME}: Still, Oz can also translate for Fischl. You, on the other hand...\nPaimon: What!? Paimon's way better than some bird!\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, how so?\nPaimon: Well, um... uh... at least Paimon doesn't need wings to fly!",
            "About Pets\t{NICKNAME}: Speaking of Fischl, she also claims to be a \"visitor from another world\"...\n{NICKNAME}: We're similar in that way. We even bring a pet along with us.\nPaimon: Pet? Now, wait just a minute, here...\n{NICKNAME}: But her raven, Oz... He looks cool, and is polite to boot.\n{NICKNAME}: More importantly, he can both scout and fight — very useful indeed.\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe I should make arrangements with Fischl to trade companions once in a while for, say, a week or two at a time. It should be quite interesting.\nPaimon: Hey! Doesn't Paimon get a say in this!?",
            "About Beidou\tPaimon: How do you become as popular and cool as Captain Beidou?\n{NICKNAME}: With enough experience...?\nPaimon: Paimon's already seen lots of things from adventuring together with you!\n{NICKNAME}: One also needs to experience trials and setbacks...\nPaimon: Paimon almost drowned that one time...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Maintain an inspirational disposition...\nPaimon: Uh-huh! Paimon's always rooted for you!\n{NICKNAME}: One must also have a... mature outlook towards problems.\nPaimon: Hey! Are you just trying to say that Paimon can't make it?",
            "About Ningguang\tPaimon: How does a person become as rich... no, as super rich as Lady Ningguang?\n{NICKNAME}: Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?\nPaimon: Well, there's the huge Jade Chamber, too! But isn't that also made of Mora?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you need an excellent mind...\nPaimon: Well... Paimon's really good at giving people nicknames!\n{NICKNAME}: You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets...\nPaimon: A serving of Fisherman's Toast goes for 1,025 Mora, and no discounts — even on rainy days.\n{NICKNAME}: You also need to be willing to work really hard...\nPaimon: Okay then... so, how do you make friends with a really rich person?\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, you're giving up already!?",
            "About Qiqi Being a Zombie\tPaimon: Umm... Do you think that Qiqi... needs to drink blood?\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... That's not a zombie, Paimon. That's a vampire.\nPaimon: Then, will she transform during a full moon?\n{NICKNAME}: Werewolves, Paimon. Not zombies.\nPaimon: Huh... As expected of a traveler, you really know a lot!\nPaimon: So, what special things can zombies do?\n{NICKNAME}: Exercises?\nPaimon: Ah, that makes a lot of sense! So, the ones that do exercises are zombies — got it!",
            "About Flying\tPaimon: Come on, {NICKNAME}, Paimon'll teach you how to fly!\nPaimon: Three, two, one!\n{NICKNAME}: Ah, Paimon's gone.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, whatever. I'm tired. Let's just sit here for a bit...\n{NICKNAME}: I'm flying with you in my heart... Mm...",
            "About Slimes\tPaimon: What sort of slime do you like the most, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Pyro Slimes, I suppose. You can feel their warmth just by getting close. That's something you'll need in the winter.\nPaimon: That's very practical, as expected of a traveler.\n{NICKNAME}: What about you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon likes them all! They're all very tasty!\n{NICKNAME}: Tasty? Hmm...\nPaimon: Turning slimes into bubbly, lovely, jubbly meals is the Paimon Special!\n{NICKNAME}: Well then...\n{NICKNAME}: I suppose that's one more thing I can eat before you become emergency rations, huh, Paimon?\nPaimon: Uhh... Paimon would rather not be on that list at all!",
            "About Hilichurls\t{NICKNAME}: Do you think that we're too harsh on the hilichurls?\nPaimon: Well... sometimes we really do seem like children who just can't resist kicking the hornet's nest...\n{NICKNAME}: I think we're doing more than just kicking it...",
            "About the Sleepers\t{NICKNAME}:  The \"Sleeper tribe\"... The hilichurls sure have interesting tribe names.\nPaimon: The Sleeper tribe will take any opportunity they can to take a nap.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that their animal-skin beds are really soft. Would you like to try them?\n{NICKNAME}: Not going to try it yourself, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon can sleep while floating! The air is the softest bed. Pretty sweet, huh?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Just a little.",
            "About the Meaties\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Meaty tribe\"...? Hahaha, these hilichurls pick the funniest names.\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Meaty tribe make regular sacrifices. The altars they build are really huge.\n{NICKNAME}: What do they pray for?\nPaimon: \"For meat to eat every day\"! It's an awesome wish, isn't it?\n{NICKNAME}: ...I suppose I should have expected that answer.",
            "About the Eclipse Tribe\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Eclipse tribe\"... So the hilichurls have normal-sounding tribe names like these, too.\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Eclipse tribe are really mysterious.\nPaimon: All the hilichurls of that tribe can draw an eclipse symbol.\nPaimon: But rumor has it that only the Dada Samachurl of the Eclipse tribe knows why the eclipse symbol is so revered within their tribe.\n{NICKNAME}: An eclipse symbol...\nPaimon: Hmm? Did you say something, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Ah... I was... asking you what sort of soup you'd like to have tonight.\nPaimon: Can't stop thinking about food, huh? Seems like you'd be more at home in the Meaty tribe than the Eclipse tribe. But anyway, Paimon wants boar soup. Thanks!",
            "About Riches\tPaimon: Paimon doesn't feel so good...\n{NICKNAME}: What's the matter?\nPaimon: Paimon hasn't opened a treasure chest in so long.

Won't you be unable to fly if you get fat?\nPaimon: Nope! Paimon never gets fat!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh...\nPaimon: So Paimon demands more food!\n{NICKNAME}: Ever eating but never growing... Don't you fail as emergency rations, then?\nPaimon: Yeah, yeah... Well it sure doesn't look like you have any other candidates... So you'll have to make do with Paimon!",

Any ideas on how to relax?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Sleeping?\nPaimon: Sleeping's boring.\n{NICKNAME}: ...Reading?\nPaimon: Paimon'll get dizzy.\n{NICKNAME}: ...Having a chat with some friends?\nPaimon: ...Ugh.\nPaimon: But those're all things that require thinking.\nPaimon: And not thinking is more relaxing.\n{NICKNAME}: And thus the \"Paimon Paradox,\" famed in the histories of philosophy in Teyvat, was put forth...",
            "About Dietary Differences\t{NICKNAME}: Liyue's cuisine is very different from that of Mondstadt.\n{NICKNAME}: For example, you can hardly find spicy fried dishes anywhere in Mondstadt.\nPaimon: That's why they say \"climate creates cuisine,\" ya know?\nPaimon: But wait... Why do all of Teyvat's slimes taste the same, then?\n{NICKNAME}: That's because you only know one way of cooking them...",
            "About Saving Money\tPaimon: Wow, a weasel thief's backpack can really hide a lot of Mora!\n{NICKNAME}: Well, it's because weasels, by nature, enjoy collecting shiny objects.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the origin of the weasel thieves has something to do with the Treasure Hoarders...\nPaimon: Also, aren't crows the type to collect shinies as well?\nPaimon: Paimon wonders if Oz has a secret stash of Mora that he collects behind Fischl's back.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, now that you mention it, Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder, do you—\nPaimon:—Uhh... Nope. Nothing here! You won't find any Mora in Paimon's shoes, no way!",
            "About Adventure Stories\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, have you ever read \"Vera's Melancholy\" before?\nPaimon: Well, it sure sounds familiar!\n{NICKNAME}: That book's pretty popular, and I've heard that the author made a tidy sum off of it...\nPaimon: *sigh* Paimon would love to make lots and lots of Mora...\nPaimon: Hmm... It's decided, then! Paimon will write an adventure story as well!\n{NICKNAME}: A tale of adventure, by Paimon?\nPaimon: Correct! It'll be a story in which the brave traveler defeats the dragon, saves the world...\nPaimon: And then sits down with his reliable companion for ten servings of Sticky Honey Roast!\n{NICKNAME}: Ten!?\nPaimon: Uh-huh! A happy ending attracts the readers, after all!\nPaimon: It's decided, then! We'll call it \"Paimon's Happiness!\"\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, what?",

            "About Paimon's Species\t{NICKNAME}: What monster made the deepest impression on you?\nPaimon: Monsters, huh? Probably... Ruin Guards.\n{NICKNAME}: Does a Ruin Guard really count as a monster? It's more like a machine...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that you can call anything that causes us trouble and needs to be defeated a \"monster.\"\nPaimon: Just like how we call anything that can be hunted \"prey.\"\n{NICKNAME}: Is that so... Well then, I think I'm finally able to classify you now, Paimon.\nPaimon: Eh? What do you mean?\n{NICKNAME}: You can be hooked and reeled in... therefore, you're a fish!\nPaimon: Hmph!",

You know, that thing!\n{NICKNAME}: Which one?\nPaimon: The one where you make your weapon disappear with a swish, and then, fwoosh — you make it appear behind your back again!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, that? Haven't you seen that a ton already?\nPaimon: But Paimon hasn't figured out how you do it yet. Could you explain it?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, can you explain how you suddenly appear in front of me, and then disappear just as suddenly?\nPaimon: Uh... well... Paimon seems to have always been able to do this. But Paimon doesn't know how...\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. I believe that the art of putting my weapon away follows the same principle.\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe it's this similarity that makes us such good friends?",
            "About Chests\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, what do you think of treasure chests?\n{NICKNAME}: I believe that they were left behind by great travelers who once passed this way.\n{NICKNAME}: Every time I open one and look at its contents, I can feel a certain kinship with those who came before...\nPaimon: And that's how you get adventure experience!",
            "About Eyes\tPaimon: Look into Paimon's eyes!\n{NICKNAME}: Something the matter?\nPaimon: Kaeya said that people's eyes will betray them.\nPaimon: He can tell if someone is telling the truth or not just by looking into their eyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Huh...\nPaimon: Paimon loves Fisherman's Toast!\n{NICKNAME}: That should be the truth. Haha, well, that's also because you love everything that can be eaten.\nPaimon: Hehe.\n{NICKNAME}: Speaking of looking into people's eyes... I remember one gaze that left a particularly deep impression on me.\nPaimon: Whose gaze was that?\n{NICKNAME}: A Ruin Guard's. Really made me want to poke its eye out...",

            "About the Luck of the Draw\tPaimon: Urrrrgh...\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? Are there pigeons around?\nPaimon: No, Paimon's just hungry.\nPaimon: What Paimon needs right now is a traveler who can whip up some delicious Sticky Honey Roast.\nPaimon: So, who's going to be the lucky traveler? Hmm?",

            "About the Vision Hunt Decree\tPaimon: It's hard to talk about the recent events in Inazuma and not mention the Vision Hunt Decree.\nPaimon: But you don't have a Vision, so you don't have to worry about losing one.\nPaimon: On the flip side, if you are caught by the Tenryou Commission, {NICKNAME}, you also can't surrender your Vision in exchange for your life...\n{NICKNAME}: I can tell them that you are my Vision.\nPaimon: Another reason to have Paimon around... Wait, WHAT!?\n{NICKNAME}: Don't worry, I wouldn't let them take you, Paimon.\nPaimon: That's more like it.\n{NICKNAME}: We'd just go to jail and suffer punishment together...\nPaimon: Uh... W—Well, if that's how it would go down, then maybe you should hand me over to them...\nPaimon: ...Wait a minute! How about we just don't get caught in the first place?",
            "About the Resistance\tPaimon: Only the ones who have the will to fight back are allowed into the Resistance!\nPaimon: Huh. In that case, Paimon also qualifies as a member.\n{NICKNAME}: And what exactly are you trying to resist, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon has been resisting against the fate of being squished all this time!\n{NICKNAME}: Then you probably won't get in.\nPaimon: Why? Is it because Paimon isn't fighting for the same cause as the Resistance?\n{NICKNAME}: It's because you're fighting for a lost cause, I'm afraid...\nPaimon: *sob* Y—You meanie!",
            "About Kamuijima Cannons\tPaimon: Kamuileon... Cannon? Kamuijuicy... Cannon? Kamuijimmy... Cannon? Ugh... What a mouthful.\n{NICKNAME}: What are you reading, Paimon?\nPaimon: Look, it's the super weapon the Shogunate army has constructed nearby to protect Tatarasuna.\nPaimon:  Kamuijima! Cannon!\n{NICKNAME}: It looks really powerful... And yet, we didn't see it do anything while we were in Tatarasuna.\nPaimon: It seems like the Resistance knew how strong it was, so before formally waging war against the Shogunate, they had covertly occupied this place.\nPaimon: But this Kamui... Kamuijima Cannon needs either special ammunition or Electro to work, so it's no use to the Resistance.\nPaimon: The Shogunate army put so much time and effort into creating this weapon... Paimon really wants to see the extent of its power.\n{NICKNAME}: If all you need is an Electro user, perhaps I can help.\nPaimon: That's right! Now we just need something that would serve as our cannon ball...\nPaimon: Huh? ...Why are you giving me that look? Hey—",
            "About Taroumaru\tPaimon: You know what? When we first arrived at the Komore Teahouse, Paimon really thought that Taroumaru would be able to speak...\n{NICKNAME}: You sound a bit disappointed.\nPaimon: Of course! If Taroumaru could speak, Paimon feels that he'd say something really interesting!\n{NICKNAME}: For example?\nPaimon: Hmm... \"Thoma, stop hiding around here, you're in my way! *woof*\"\n{NICKNAME}: Huh, that makes sense.\nPaimon: Or... \"Kozue, you're bound to me for the rest of your life, unless our contract is terminated! *woof* *woof*\"\n{NICKNAME}: You didn't believe Kozue when she said she'd signed a secret contract forcing her to work part-time at the Teahouse, did you?\nPaimon: Oh! Paimon just thought of another one. This one's quite good—\nPaimon: \"Just look at this visitor! Paimon, is it? Look at how cute and clever she is. Today, all her meals are on the house! *woof*\"\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way Taroumaru would say something like that.\nPaimon: Hee-hee...",
            "About Gorou\tPaimon: Hmm...\n{NICKNAME}: What are you mulling over, Paimon?\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, do you remember Gorou's fluffy ears?\nPaimon: Paimon really wants something like that... Or maybe horns similar to the ones Ganyu has. Ganyu's horns are pretty cute as well.\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, do you have any ideas?\n{NICKNAME}: Let me see, hmm... Oh, I found something!\nPaimon: Really? Aw, {NICKNAME}, Paimon always knew you were reliable!\n{NICKNAME}: Ta-da! I present to you the Tusk of Monoceros Caeli!\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't need that!\nPaimon: *sigh* If Paimon can't have Gorou's fluffy ears, then maybe at least something like his fluffy tail...\n{NICKNAME}: Bubadada! Here you go — Tail of Boreas!\nPaimon: ...Not that! Also, combining those two is definitely not the look Paimon is going for!",
            "About Publishing Novels\tPaimon: It's amazing that Inazuma has places like the Yae Publishing House which specializes in publishing novels!\nPaimon: They even host competitions! Wow!\n{NICKNAME}: If that's the case, then perhaps you can submit a draft of the book you've been working on, \"Paimon's Happiness.\"\nPaimon: Well, about that... Paimon has misplaced the drafts on our way to Inazuma...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Really?\nPaimon: Fine! Paimon hasn't started writing it yet...\nPaimon: It's not Paimon's fault! Paimon's been meaning to do it but three days ago, Paimon's pen broke. The day before yesterday, Paimon had hand cramps. Yesterday — a sprained foot. Today... Paimon... Hmmm... Paimon's hungry!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, it sounds like you'll sooner write \"A Thousand Excuses with Paimon\" than \"Paimon's Happiness.\"",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tPaimon: Kazuha is a free spirit, wouldn't you say?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, he seems to be a bit of a loner too.\nPaimon: Being able to explore the world at his leisure while savoring the beauty of everything around him. That doesn't sound too shabby...\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you aren't thinking of sneaking off to go on a solo adventure, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Aw, I would never leave you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Paimon's really happy to hear that. Here... Hee—hee, have this...\n{NICKNAME}: Monthly food expenses... 300,000 Mora!?\nPaimon: Hey! Wait! {NICKNAME}, Where are you going?\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly feel like going solo. Maybe it's not a bad idea after all.\nPaimon: Please don't go! Wait for Paimon!",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tPaimon: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon, you look so serious today.\nPaimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.\nPaimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families. They have an endless supply of Mora and mountains of delicious food to eat...\n{NICKNAME}: I can't disagree. Those are exactly the things you're fond of.\nPaimon: But after getting to know Ayaka better, Paimon realized that a young lady from a noble family can also have her share of hardships.\nPaimon: She needs to shoulder her clan's duties and responsibilities. She works so hard and has very little time for herself.\nPaimon: Ayaka must be exhausted, she should try to relax a bit...\nPaimon: Ah, that's right! Let's invite Ayaka to the next festival!\nPaimon: If she got an invite from us, there's no way she'd refuse.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, I'd like to go to another festival with her.\nPaimon: Besides, if Ayaka's around, she can pick up the tab for us...\n{NICKNAME}: ...I should've seen that coming...",
            "About Imitating Ayaka\tPaimon: Ayaka gives a sense of noble elegance with every gesture she makes.\n{NICKNAME}: Can you do an Ayaka impression, Paimon?\nPaimon: Let's give it a try.\nPaimon: \"Oh my, you've been picking mushrooms so earnestly just to make Chicken-Mushroom Skewers for me?\"\nPaimon: \"How cute...\"\n{NICKNAME}: That was nothing like Ayaka. But...\n{NICKNAME}: Even though you didn't sound like yourself, it didn't feel completely out of place for you either...",
            "About Festival Traditions\tPaimon: It's a well-established tradition that during Inazuman celebrations everyone's wearing festive masks.\nPaimon: Paimon tried to look around the stalls, but hasn't found any mask that fits...\n{NICKNAME}: So you really want a mask of your own?\nPaimon: Of course! Not wearing a mask during an Inazuman festival is the same as not receiving a bouquet at the Windblume Festival...\n{NICKNAME}: Let me make one for you.\nPaimon: Whoa! {NICKNAME}, you're the best!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm, I wonder what kind of mask will fit you best? How about... a slime mask?\nPaimon: Yay, Paimon Slime!",
            "About Yoimiya\tPaimon: Do you think Yoimiya's dad's poor hearing is related to fireworks?\nPaimon: He's been making and testing fireworks for many years now, and being exposed to the sound of gunpowder explosions on a daily basis... Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...\nPaimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?\nPaimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?\nPaimon: Uh... Um...\nPaimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...\n{NICKNAME}: Then you'd need to leave me.\nPaimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!\nPaimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...\n{NICKNAME}: Actually, she can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind, but I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.\nPaimon: Eh? So you knew this whole time, but didn't tell Paimon?\nPaimon: How could you! You bully!",
            "About Sayu's Troubles\tPaimon: Sayu seems to have a lot on her mind.\nPaimon: Paimon can't understand why she'd have so many worries.\n{NICKNAME}: I guess this is what they call growing pains.\nPaimon: Hmm, Paimon can't relate to that.\nPaimon: After all, it's not Paimonly to worry too much.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Bad news! We're almost out of Mora. I guess we'll have to tighten the purse strings for the next few days...\nPaimon: Wh-What? Noooo!\n{NICKNAME}: See, you're not as carefree as you thought.\nPaimon: Ooh... How could you prank Paimon like that...",
            "About Onikabuto\tPaimon: Those Onikabuto bugs look so scary! The patterns on their backs are terrifying!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you mean those demonic patterns? It's because they don't like to fight, so they purposely evolved their patterns in a way that scares their enemies away.\nPaimon: That's really smart. We should try to learn a thing or two from them!\nPaimon: We could borrow Xiao's mask. If a hilichurl saw you wearing it, do you think they'd run in fear?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I don't think Xiao would agree to that...\nPaimon: Yeah... Hmm, how about we ask Sayu to steal his mask for us?\nPaimon: She knows ninjutsu that allows her to vanish into thin air. She can steal it for sure! Problem solved!\nPaimon: Uh... If we are afraid of Xiao evening the score with us, how about we steal Childe's mask? We've kicked his butt many times before!\n{NICKNAME}: I don't think stealing other people's belongings is a good idea. Also, what if Sayu doesn't agree to all of this?\nPaimon: Th—Then let's... Let's visit Albedo first.\nPaimon: If Albedo can develop a growth serum for Sayu, she'll help us for sure!\n{NICKNAME}: Brilliant, now we just need you to come up with a way to make Albedo help us.\nPaimon: Ugh! Paimon's head is going to explode. Let's stick to festival masks for now.",
            "About Naku Weed\tPaimon: Even though Naku Weed has a flower-like structure, its \"petals\" are in fact leaves.\nPaimon: Its actual bloom is rather fragile, so the surrounding leaves try their hardest to grow strong and protect it...\nPaimon: Hee-hee, just like Paimon is protecting you right now.\n{NICKNAME}: Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?\nPaimon: Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?",
            "About Naku Weed and Storms\tPaimon: Did you know? The people in Inazuma use the vibrations of Naku Weed to forecast thunderstorms.\nPaimon: Because Naku Weed grows in areas that are infused with Electro, it's naturally drawn to thunder and lightning.\n{NICKNAME}: Does that mean Naku Weed is similar to you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Eh? How so?\n{NICKNAME}: You know, because you usually hang out in areas infused with gourmet food and are naturally drawn to tasty snacks!\nPaimon: Hee-hee, that's true!\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon radar activated...\nPaimon: *beep* Delicacies, here we go!",
            "About Sakura Blooms\tPaimon: The blossoms drifting down from the Sacred Sakura are so dazzling!\nPaimon: Paimon heard that those flower petals can stay suspended in the air for so long because of being infused with Electro.\n{NICKNAME}: Is it the same principle behind your levitation abilities?\nPaimon: Uh... Ah... That's because...\n{NICKNAME}: You do know what allows you to fly, don't you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon can fly because of... mysterious powers, obviously!\n{NICKNAME}: Got it. Seems like you have no idea.\n{NICKNAME}: How about we let Albedo do some research? He's good at cracking such mysteries...\nPaimon: Please don't!",
            "About Lavender Melons\tPaimon: Lavender Melons sure are useful!\nPaimon: Their flesh can be eaten, and their skin can be processed to make dyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon sure is useful!\n{NICKNAME}: She can serve as my guide, and she can also give other people ugly nicknames, haha.\nPaimon: Yep! Thank you for your validation!\nPaimon: Wait a minute, is there more? Is Paimon about to get roasted?\nPaimon: Paimon's gonna cover your mouth to stop you from talking!",
            "About Swords\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, have you noticed?\nPaimon: In Inazuma, people who wear swords on their waists are a minority. Most soldiers use spears.\nPaimon: Could it be that swords are a symbol of status... Should we wear them as well?\nPaimon: But the swords here are all too big for Paimon... There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!\n{NICKNAME}: A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.\nPaimon: Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Really? Really? Let's have a look!\nPaimon: Hey! Isn't that the knife we use to cut fruit?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, at least it's the right size for you...\n{NICKNAME}: Ahem, \"What matters isn't the value of the sword, it's the fighting spirit.\"\nPaimon: Nice try, but Paimon won't fall for this, no matter how cool it sounds!",
            "About Hot Springs\tPaimon: Did you know there are hot springs in Inazuma?\n{NICKNAME}: ...But there are no volcanoes.\nPaimon: Umm, Paimon heard that the heat comes from a giant furnace!\nPaimon: If we get the chance, Paimon also wants to check out a hot spring. Unfortunately, it seems like only the big shots are granted entry.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Let's head back to the Dadaupa Gorge in Mondstadt!\nPaimon: Eh? Why so sudden?\n{NICKNAME}: Back in the Dadaupa Gorge, the hilichurls have a huge cauldron that's heated by Flaming Flowers. It should be similar to a hot spring, right? You can bathe in their... soup, I guess?\nPaimon: ???",
            "About Jugemu\tPaimon: In Inazuma, it's customary for parents to choose a lucky name for their child.\n{NICKNAME}: Those names symbolize everyone's expectations and wishes for the child, like prosperity, wealth, good health, and safety.\nPaimon: Because of these expectations, parents often pick extra long names, and cram all sorts of blessings into them.\n{NICKNAME}: So hypothetically, if one day a little girl fell into a lake on her way back home, then her friends might rush to her house to tell everyone, \"Something bad happened!\"\nPaimon: \"Oh, what happened?\"\n{NICKNAME}: Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, Prinzessin der Verurteilung Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, come quick! Centennial Genius Astrologist Mona Megistus has fallen into the water!\nPaimon: ...Mona falling into the water doesn't sound like an emergency situation though.\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. The fast-swimming Mona would come back home around the same time her friends are done saying her name, haha.",
            "About Inazuma's Islands\tPaimon: Inazuma's scenery is quite different than what we've seen so far.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, Inazuma's an island nation.\nPaimon: Before the invention of boats, how did the people living on different islands communicate with one another?\n{NICKNAME}: According to Yoimiya's dad, they probably used smoke signals to transmit information.\n{NICKNAME}: Or, they would...\nPaimon: Yeah...?\n{NICKNAME}: They would commission people who could freeze the water surface to travel between the islands and deliver messages.\nPaimon: Whoa! If Kaeya had lived in Inazuma back then, he would've been even busier than Master Jean now!",
            "About Tanuki\tPaimon: Tanuki are really mysterious creatures.\n{NICKNAME}: I think they are really cute.\nPaimon: Yeah, they're cute... until they start talking.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, I wonder... If you couldn't talk, would you appear to be more mysterious and noble?\nPaimon: Are you trying to mock me?\n{NICKNAME}: *randomly humming innocently*",
            "About Tanuki and Their Illusions\tPaimon: Did anyone tell you that there are monsters called tanuki in Inazuma that can take on the form of any human they see?\n{NICKNAME}: I heard such rumors before. They must know some mysterious transformation techniques.\nPaimon: What if one day a tanuki tricked you by transforming into Paimon? Oh no... Paimon's worried now! \n{NICKNAME}: No worries, I'd surely be able to tell the difference— Wait! You're just concerned about my Mora, aren't you?\nPaimon: Of course... Ah! ...No, no! Paimon's only concerned about your safety, {NICKNAME}!\nPaimon: Hmph, stop looking at Paimon like that. *pouting* Look, just think about it! If there were two Paimons, how would you find out which one is the real one?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Eh-he.\nPaimon: What do you mean \"eh-he\"!?\n{NICKNAME}: See, only the real Paimon would respond like that.\nPaimon: Ah! Paimon got tricked again...",
            "About Other Shrines\tPaimon: We've been passing by a lot of small shrines lately, but none of them seem to be dedicated to the Electro Archon.\n{NICKNAME}: They were probably built for lesser deities. The people of Inazuma believe that everything around them has a spirit, and those spirits will help them in their time of need.\nPaimon: Oh, so the people make shrines for them, and give them offerings.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. In a way, it's a form of prayer and a token of appreciation.\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now! Let's find Ayaka, and have her put up a shrine for us!\nPaimon: If we do that, we'll be able to get lots of offerings as well!\nPaimon: Paimon's so happy!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe. Uh... I—Is that an acceptable thing to do?\nPaimon: What's wrong? Haven't we been helping out everyone this whole time? We may be doing an even better job than those deities!\n{NICKNAME}: You do have a point...\n{NICKNAME}: But when I picture people placing flowers or fruits in front of a shrine for me... it doesn't feel right.",
            "About the Rain on Yashiori Island\t{NICKNAME}: It never stops raining on Yashiori Island. I heard it's because of the lingering evil energy.\nPaimon: \"Evil energy\"? What's that? Sounds terrifying.\n{NICKNAME}: It's caused by the remains of an evil god somewhere on the island. Because its power hasn't fully dispersed, the remaining energy causes all sorts of misfortunes. That's what I meant when I said \"evil energy.\"\nPaimon: Oh, that makes sense. But Paimon doesn't think rain is a bad thing.\nPaimon: Maybe that god has been crying all this time because they were bullied.\n{NICKNAME}: Crying? I don't think gods can cry. I mean, I've never seen Venti or Zhongli cry before.\nPaimon: There are exceptions! If you pinch Paimon, you'll be able to see a crying god.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? Are you a god?\nPaimon: Paimon sure is!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, let me guess... The flying god of silly questions? The god of slimes? Or the god of being fished out from the water?\nPaimon: Paimon's none of those! Hmph!\nPaimon: As your bodyguard, {NICKNAME}, Paimon is the god of protection! Hehe.",
            "About Bantan Sango Detective Agency\t{NICKNAME}: In Hanamizaka, there's a place called the Bantan Sango Detective Agency.\nPaimon: Paimon remembers. It's the one run by Sango and Ryuuji, right? Everyone speaks highly of them.\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, I heard that they frequently get caught up in strange incidents, and some places have banned them from entering their premises...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that's undeserved. After all, Sango and Ryuuji have helped a lot of people...\n{NICKNAME}: Would you invite them if you were organizing a dinner party?\n{NICKNAME}: What if halfway through the meal, one of the guests suddenly shrieked and collapsed onto the ground...\nPaimon: I—If that's the case, then Paimon thinks it's a bad idea. Paimon suddenly feels that hanging out with them could be dangerous...\n{NICKNAME}: Well, that's the price you pay for being a famous detective.",
            "About Drawing Fortune Slips\tPaimon: Oh yeah, have you drawn fortune slips at the shrine before, {NICKNAME}?\nPaimon: If we draw them before our next adventure, they may provide us with some guidance.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, but what if our draws are inauspicious or turn out to be a bad omen? If that happened, we'd probably end up in a bad mood...\nPaimon: Oh, that's fine. According to the shrine maidens, if someone draws a bad omen, they just need to hang it on a tree in the shrine...\nPaimon: So, we should keep on drawing and drawing, until we get a super lucky draw! Then, we'll hang all the bad ones on the tree!\n{NICKNAME}: If everyone did that, there'd be no more space left to hang the slips...",
            "About Musou no Hitotachi\tPaimon: Musou no Hitotachi is amazing!\nPaimon: It can beat any enemy with a single slash!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, but for Childe, it might need three slashes...\nPaimon: Y—Yeah!\nPaimon: Anyway, if you mastered that technique, Paimon wouldn't have to worry about you for the rest of our journey!\n{NICKNAME}: So, where can one learn that technique?\nPaimon: Yeah, where can one learn that technique?\n{NICKNAME}: Hm?\nPaimon: Quit looking at Paimon like that! O—Okay, Paimon will keep an eye on you during our adventures...",
            "About Sangonomiya Kokomi\tPaimon: Did you know, {NICKNAME}? That Sangonomiya Kokomi, she's Watatsumi Island's Divine Priestess.\nPaimon: In other words, she's the ruler of Watatsumi Island! The whole of Watatsumi Island is controlled by her.\nPaimon: Paimon also wants to become a big shot like her...\n{NICKNAME}: What will you do after you become a big shot?\nPaimon: Then, Paimon will deliver justice. For example... Ahem.\nPaimon: The suspect in question, known as the Traveler, ate two Dango for lunch and only gave one to the victim, Paimon. This is a serious violation of article thirty seven, \"Fairness and Justice,\" of the \"Paimon Decree.\"\n{NICKNAME}: Oh... may I ask how Your Excellency Paimon plans to resolve this issue?\nPaimon: Of course. As compensation for your wrongdoings, you will have to make even more Dango for Paimon, hee-hee!",
            "About Transience\tPaimon: Paimon wonders what the previous Shogun was like.\n{NICKNAME}: It appears that she was a person who understood the fleeting nature of things, and accepted the inevitable fate of departing this world one day.\nPaimon: After all, realizing the fragility of things in front of you makes you treasure them even more.\n{NICKNAME}: This way of thinking must've influenced Inazuma's aesthetics. This world is transient, people come and go. The fun times we shared, our companionship, and the delicious foods we got to savor — those emotions and experiences are real things that existed at some point in time, not just empty concepts.\nPaimon: Even though... Even though every banquet must eventually come to an end, it'd be nice to enjoy those happy moments for a little longer.\n{NICKNAME}: \"Shifting seasons and elusive dreams, the ephemeral and fleeting, with thine companionship, all are eternal.\"\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't get it!\n{NICKNAME}: I'm saying that I'm having a lot of fun traveling with you, Paimon. It'd be nice if we could just go on like this forever.\nPaimon: Paimon'll take your word for it then.",
            "About Shrine Maidens\tPaimon: The clothes that shrine maidens wear are quite unique.\n{NICKNAME}: I heard that after the Sakoku Decree is lifted, Yae Miko plans to run a rental service where people can try on shrine maiden outfits as a tourist attraction in various places. Combined with the latest Kamera technology from Fontaine, it seems like a real Mora maker.\nPaimon: Oh!\n{NICKNAME}: {MThe shrine maidens in the Grand Shrine even asked me if I knew any pretty girls who are willing to become models. All they need to do is to dress up in a shrine maiden outfit and smile to the Kamera. They even asked me to be a model and said all I needed was some makeup.}{FThe shrine maidens in the Grand Shrine even asked me if I was interested in becoming a model! All I need to do is wear a shrine maiden outfit and smile to the Kamera. They also asked me if I knew any other cute girls.}\nPaimon: What!?\n{NICKNAME}: I immediately shared this idea with Rosaria. I feel like they can do something similar at the Church of Favonius with the garments they wear.\nPaimon: Wait, Paimon doesn't think that a...\n{NICKNAME}: Sadly, Rosaria found the idea of it too troublesome.\nPaimon: Maybe it's for the better...",
            "About the Artist Utamarou\tPaimon: Aoi gave Paimon a painting. Turns out it's not edible, but Paimon is still very happy with that gift!\n{NICKNAME}: Aoi? The general goods shop owner? Let me see.\nPaimon: Here, but be careful. It was painted by a famous artist, Utamarou. It's quite valuable!\n{NICKNAME}: Utamarou? Hmm... I think I've heard that name before...\nPaimon: Of course, master Utamarou's works can be found all around Inazuma after all!\nPaimon: Did you see one of them in Ayaka's residence? The one that Paimon has right now isn't too shabby either.\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, I remember now! One of those paintings was used by Yoimiya as kindling, right?\nPaimon: Eh? Kindling?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, yeah! I think Thoma used it as padding for table legs as well.\nPaimon: What? Padding?\n{NICKNAME}: And, if I remember correctly, I also saw Sayu use a stack of those paintings as a cushion for her nap.\nPaimon: Sayu has several of those works? That can't be right...\n{NICKNAME}: Real masterpieces aren't mass-produced. If you ask me, that Utamarou isn't a real master at all.\nPaimon: Hey—",
            "About the Teahouse and Its Owner\tPaimon: The Komore Teahouse is doing surprisingly well. They have a great number of visitors every day.\nPaimon: We should also open a teahouse. Paimon feels that it'd be really profitable!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Well, if we do end up opening a teahouse, then you're gonna be the boss, for sure.\nPaimon: Eh? Deal!\nPaimon: Paimon didn't think that you'd have so much faith in Paimon's abilities... Paimon will make sure to be a responsible manager, and make our shop the best teahouse in Teyvat!\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh, I don't think it'd need to be managed... Do you remember Taroumaru?\nPaimon: Yup, he's the owner of the Komore Teahouse, right? A lot of the clients go to the Teahouse to play with him rather than drink tea.\n{NICKNAME}: So I was thinking, if you were running the shop, you'd definitely be more popular than Taroumaru.\nPaimon: Hee-hee, of course... Hey! So you don't really trust Paimon's management skills, you just want a mascot!?",
            "About the Sakoku Decree\t{NICKNAME}: With the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, I guess the Sakoku Decree will be the next one to go.\nPaimon: Here's hoping that everything goes well.\n{NICKNAME}: Let's encourage everyone to hold on for just a bit longer.\nPaimon: Yeah!\n{NICKNAME}: If we get the chance, let's find Atsuko and tell her that the sakura trees in her homeland are blooming.\nPaimon: How is that supposed to comfort her!?",
            "About Kimonos\tPaimon: *sigh* Ogura Mio says that she hardly has any fancy kimonos in stock these days. So, chances are that you won't be able to buy one, even if you can afford it.\nPaimon: It's a real tragedy... Paimon wants to look glamorous, too.\n{NICKNAME}: But the Sakoku Decree's been abolished... She should be able to import silk from Liyue now.\nPaimon: *gasp* You're right! Great, so there's hope for Paimon's kimono-dream after all!\nPaimon: Just imagine it... Paimon emerges from Ogura's shop wearing a custom-made pure-silk one-of-a-kind kimono. Total transformation! This Paimon's going places!\nPaimon: No longer just a sidekick in the legendary Traveler's adventure story... Oh no, say hello to Paimon the Elegant, wearer of fine silks and fated friend of heroes!\nPaimon: Ahhh... Wouldn't that be amazing?\nPaimon: ...It would, wouldn't it, {NICKNAME}? Um, so—\n{NICKNAME}: What I'm hearing is... you want me to pay for your new wardrobe.\nPaimon: Exactly, you read Paimon's mind! See, that's what being \"fated friends\" is all about!\nPaimon: Um, so Paimon was thinking seven different styles, one for each day of the week. Still not sure on the specific designs though, let Paimon think...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Uh, suddenly, I'm not so interested in buying.",
            "About Canned Knowledge\tPaimon: Free knowledge without having to study at all? Canned Knowledge is amazing!\nPaimon: Could Sumeru have Canned Knowledge about the different customs of the seven nations, too?\nPaimon: If so, Paimon could just open a can every time we get to a new place. Paimon wouldn't have to explain things ever again!\n{NICKNAME}: Or we could just open them all here in Sumeru.\nPaimon: But... but traveling wouldn't be any fun without surprises to look forward to!\n{NICKNAME}: Ooh, plus, if we opened them all here, I wouldn't even need Paimon as a guide anymore.\nPaimon: Okay scrap that idea! No more Canned Knowledge, let's save our Mora for something else!\nPaimon: Something like... Oh! Tipping Paimon for guide services! Heehee, seems fair, right?",
            "About The Eremites\tPaimon: The Eremites are a real motley crew...\n{NICKNAME}: There's certainly a diverse range of characters.\nPaimon: Hmmm... yeah, that could explain it! Paimon can play lots of different characters too.\nPaimon: Judgy Paimon, knowledgeable Paimon, helpful Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And of course the classic, completely-misses-the-point Paimon.",
            "About Beliefs\tPaimon: Have you noticed something? People in Sumeru don't seem to have a lot of faith in Lesser Lord Kusanali.\nPaimon: Back in Liyue and Inazuma, people were pretty enthusiastic about Rex Lapis and the Almighty Shogun.\nPaimon: Those strange scholars are one thing, but even everyone living downtown only ever seems to talk about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. And the most delicious mushrooms are said to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's blessing.\nPaimon: Speaking of which, lots of the dishes in Liyue are said to have been taught and approved by Rex Lapis himself...\nPaimon: Aha! So as long as a god blesses their people with delicious food, people will worship them!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, if their name is Paimon, sure.\nPaimon: Huh? Wait, so... {NICKNAME}, what do you believe in, then?\n{NICKNAME}: Me? Hmm... Paimon, of course.\nPaimon: Heehee, that's right!",
            "About the Wall of Samiel\tPaimon: The first time we saw the Wall of Samiel, Paimon was stunned... It seems to go on forever.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, it was built to protect the entire rainforest, after all.\nPaimon: And, it's so, so tall...\nPaimon: Who knows if {NICKNAME}'ll be able to climb all the way to the top.\n{NICKNAME}: I doubt it...? Also, why do I have to climb it, exactly?\nPaimon: Uh... because it's right there?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, even so... No.\nPaimon: The Wall of Samiel is right there in front of us!\n{NICKNAME}: I know, I know, but it's way too—\nPaimon: But it's the Wall of Samiel...\n{NICKNAME}: Fine! I'll go, okay?",
            "About Akasha Terminals\tPaimon: All these Sumeru scholars seem to wear Akasha Terminals so they can get information from the Akasha system.\nPaimon: It's like they're carrying an interactive encyclopedia with them wherever they go. Paimon's kinda jealous.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm not jealous. I have an even better encyclopedia that automatically follows me around, gives me the A-to-Z on everything in Teyvat, and the best part is, it can even talk!\nPaimon: Huh? Was that a compliment? Aw, you're making Paimon blush... Paimon definitely doesn't know as much as an encyclopedia! A-to-Y at most.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you know... maybe if you ate a little less, you'd have room for Z, too.\nPaimon: Hey!!!",
            "About Aranara Names\tPaimon: Arama, Arana, Araja, Arakavi... Whew, Aranara names are so hard to remember...\nPaimon: The only bit Paimon's sure of is that they all start with \"Ara\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Right, so if you were an Aranara, your name would be \"Arapaimon.\"\nPaimon: Yup, and as for {NICKNAME}...\nPaimon: Hmm, actually, they'd probably call you Nara {NICKNAME}...\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, we're all Nara to them...\nPaimon: So if there was someone whose actual name was \"Nara,\" what would the Aranara call them?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Nara Nara\"... I guess. Sounds kinda cute.\nPaimon: Hehe, yeah.",
            "About Aranara Cuisine\tPaimon: For some reason, the Aranara's food all tasted a little too... um, how to put this... a little too \"fresh.\"\nPaimon: It's totally different from what we usually eat.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, but their ingredients are top-quality.\nPaimon: Yeah, that's true. Still, those mushrooms and fruits were so raw, it felt like they were gonna keep growing in Paimon's stomach!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh, you're exaggerating, right? You do have a point, though — maybe the best ingredients don't need a lot of fancy cooking.\nPaimon: You're right. If the ingredients are good enough, they'll taste great even when cooked with the simplest methods.\n{NICKNAME}: Just like Paimon. Just a little salt and pepper, and—\nPaimon: Hey! For crying out loud, we're in Sumeru now! Don't you think that joke's getting a little old?",
            "About Dori's Genie\tPaimon: How did a genie that big get into Dori's lamp?\n{NICKNAME}: Only one way to find out: In you go, Paimon.\nPaimon: Not a chance! There's no way Paimon would fit in there!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well... if you want, you can be the genie of the Serenitea Pot instead?\nPaimon: Oooh, great idea! Paimon's down!\n{NICKNAME}: You seem pretty excited about this...\nPaimon: Uh, yeah! Paimon's been wanting to try this for ages! ...Poof! Didst thou summon me, O Traveler from a distant land?\nPaimon: Come on, come on, now you have to grant Paimon three wishes! Paimon's first wish is... bring Paimon lots of delicious food!\n{NICKNAME}: Hey, you're not supposed to be the one making wishes!",
            "About Bimarstan\tPaimon: Whoa, healthcare is FREE in Sumeru?\n{NICKNAME}: Are you feeling unwell, Paimon?\nPaimon: No, not right now. Thanks for asking, though.\nPaimon: Hehe... Eating the street food on every corner has never sounded so tempting!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, your stomach is gonna punish you for that!\nPaimon: If so, Paimon'll go see a doctor and get treated — it's all for free! It'd be a waste not to take advantage of this, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe... but then again, the treatment would likely include a restricted diet.\nPaimon: *gasp* Oh no! So no more delicious food, then?\n{NICKNAME}: That, plus the doctor would make you take the most bitter-tasting medicine ever.\nPaimon: O—Okay... Maybe Paimon needs to reconsider this idea...",
            "About the Scholars\tPaimon: So many people in Sumeru want to become scholars.\nPaimon: Motivated by this ambition, they all study really hard to try and achieve it...\nPaimon: But Paimon bets that the first ever scholar didn't set out to become a scholar...\nPaimon: Hmm... so what do you think the first ever scholar's ambition was?\n{NICKNAME}: Probably... to get their research paper written as quickly as possible.\nPaimon: Huh? But isn't a scholar's ultimate goal supposed to be \"pursuing the highest and greatest knowledge\" or something?\nPaimon: Paimon's sure that it must have been because of a fervent desire for knowledge that they became Sumeru's first true scholar.\n{NICKNAME}: Writing papers is how you pursue knowledge.\nPaimon: But what about when it's the highest and greatest knowledge of all...\n{NICKNAME}: Even then, if you wanted to prove it, you'd need a research paper.\n{NICKNAME}: And after that, you'd need to start working on another paper to validate your original thesis...\nPaimon: O—Okay, Paimon's got it! Come on, don't look so sad! It's not like you have to worry about writing papers yourself!\nPaimon: ...Y—You've never had to write a paper before, right...?",
            "About Amurta\tPaimon: Paimon wants to go visit the Amurta scholars!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, when did you become such an avid student, Paimon?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon heard that the Amurta scholars' research is all about nature.\nPaimon: Which means... they must have to research which animals are edible, and which ones taste the best, and... y'know that kind of thing!\nPaimon: Paimon thinks it'd be really fun to help them out with their research.\n{NICKNAME}: In other words, you've got a craving for some tasty, organic dishes.\nPaimon: No! Paimon genuinely thinks that it's a really meaningful research topic and wants to help out!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, well in that case... I think the Amurta scholars might be more interested to find out about Paimon's species and behavioral patterns.\nPaimon: Uh... Gee is that the time? Paimon just remembered we have something else more important to do!",
            "About Sumpter Beasts\tPaimon: Sumpter Beasts are adorable! Paimon likes how the people who keep them give them each a special name based on their most distinctive traits!\n{NICKNAME}: For all we know, the Sumpter Beasts might be giving each of us a name in return. Maybe that's how they respond when we call their name.\nPaimon: Really? So what kind of name do think they'd give us?\n{NICKNAME}: (Sumpter Beast noises)\nPaimon: How is anyone supposed to understand that!\n{NICKNAME}: A rough translation would be...\n{NICKNAME}: \"Vociferous Pestiferous Melliculus Niveous Micro-Bipedal.\"\n{NICKNAME}: That's the scientific name, of course.\nPaimon: Oh? What would the common name be then?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Noisy Two-Legged Critter\"\nPaimon: Hey! Why keep only the negative traits?",
            "About the Seventh Darshan\tPaimon: There are six Darshans in Sumeru.\nPaimon: It would be cool if Paimon had her own Darshan too!\nPaimon: It'll be called... Paimonology!\n{NICKNAME}: What wisdom would Paimonology stand for?\nPaimon: Uh... practical wisdom for everyday life!\n{NICKNAME}: So Paimonology scholars would specialize in the art of cooking slimes in a hundred different ways, never letting a single Mora escape their grasp, giving people ugly nicknames... et cetera?\nPaimon: Whoa, you read Paimon's mind! Also, don't forget \"How to Become the Best Travel Guide in Teyvat\"!\nPaimon: This is a fantastic idea! Come on, let's go submit a Darshan application to the Akademiya! From this day on, {NICKNAME}'ll be the Grand Sage of Paimonology!\n{NICKNAME}: I'd like to decline the honor, please...",
            "About Shroomboars\tPaimon: Did you know that there are all kinds of strange Shroom-Kin in Sumeru?\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, yeah. Here's a fun one — legend has it that there were some forest boars who couldn't live without mushrooms, and the two species gradually formed a symbiotic relationship with each other. Now they're known as \"Shroomboars.\"\nPaimon: Woah, that's a lot like us! Paimon can't live without {NICKNAME} either.\n{NICKNAME}: If you can't live without me, that means... I'm the shroom, and Paimon's the...\nPaimon: Boar!\nPaimon: Hey, wait a second...",
            "About the Grand Bazaar\tPaimon: The residents of the Grand Bazaar are all so talented!\nPaimon: They sell their own woven goods, beautiful vases and jars, and delicious-smelling spices that make Paimon's tummy start rumbling...\nPaimon: And they all sing and dance really well! Paimon wishes she could do that.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, if you're serious about it, there's no reason you couldn't learn.\nPaimon: What? Really?\n{NICKNAME}: Well for starters, you have a natural advantage when it comes to dancing.\n{NICKNAME}: You won't trip over yourself, or accidentally step on someone else's foot...\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon always forgets how useful flying can be!\nPaimon: Alright then! Let's go bust a move at the Grand Bazaar and watch everyone shower Paimon with admiration!\n{NICKNAME}: Aha, so that's what this is all about.",
            "About Divination\tPaimon: People in Sumeru seem to take divination and fortune-telling pretty seriously.\nPaimon: For starters, there's astrology, although only the scholars get to practice that. But ordinary citizens have their ways, too. They can do divinations with just a cup of coffee!\n{NICKNAME}: It's the nation of wisdom after all. It seems like people have an insatiable curiosity to learn about everything, including their own future.\nPaimon: Paimon heard that they can tell your fate just by looking at the bottom of a finished cup of coffee...\nPaimon: Sounds way easier than climbing to the top of a tower and staring at the stars all night!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, so you're interested in learning your fate now?\nPaimon: Yeah... although, Paimon's really more interested in finding out what the coffee tastes like.",
            "About Purbiruni and Pursina\tPaimon: Khedive and Anisa kept talking about \"Purbiruni\" this and \"Pursina\" that...\nPaimon: Why do all these words have \"pur\" at the front?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, \"Pur\" means \"descendant,\" and also \"student\"... So in this case, they're referring to themselves as the children and students of the great sages of old.\nPaimon: Huh, so that's what it means... From the way they were throwing these words around, Paimon was sure it'd be something to be proud of.\n{NICKNAME}: Wait... But isn't it?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon for one would much rather be known as the founding father than have a name that basically says \"So-and-so's my daddy.\" Pretty embarrassing, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Um... I have to admit, I've never thought about it like that...",
            "About Studying Abroad\tPaimon: It's not only Sumeru locals at the Akademiya, huh. There are students from other nations too.\nPaimon: Imagine leaving your hometown behind and traveling to a faraway and unfamiliar land in the pursuit of learning... How inspiring!\n{NICKNAME}: We travel to unfamiliar lands pretty often, too.\nPaimon: Huh, you're right! That means we're also super inspiring!\n{NICKNAME}: Not in the pursuit of learning, though.\nPaimon: Oh... So we're not as inspiring as the students after all...\nPaimon: Buuut we do know the best places to eat in Sumeru, and who you can rely on to help you out! That counts as knowledge, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, and to many people, it could be extremely valuable knowledge.\nPaimon: Great, so we're just as inspiring as them after all!",
            "About the Divine Tree\tPaimon: The whole of Sumeru City is built on top of a giant tree. How amazing is that!\nPaimon: We've seen lots of incredible trees on our journey, haven't we? There's our old stomping ground at Windrise, the Frostbearing Tree on Dragonspine, and the Sacred Sakura in Inazuma!\nPaimon: Sumeru's tree doesn't seem to have a fancy name though. People just call it \"the Divine Tree\"...\n{NICKNAME}: Sometimes, the most important things have the simplest names.\nPaimon: Really? Hmm, maybe you have a point. Long names would be kinda inconvenient if you had to say them every day.\nPaimon: Anyway, people in the city only have to say \"down below\" and everyone knows they mean the bottom of the tree.\nPaimon: What's that saying again? \"Names aren't things themselves, they're just words for things.\"\n{NICKNAME}: So is Paimon just a word for a thing, too?\nPaimon: Yeah. Well, uh, kinda. But... wait, no! No, Paimon is just Paimon!",
            "About Inter-Darshan Relations\tPaimon: So, with Sumeru having so many scholars in different Darshans, do you think they end up arguing a lot?\nPaimon: You know, just like the rivalry between Li cuisine and Yue cuisine in Liyue.\n{NICKNAME}: I'm sure they do. Conflict between different schools of thought is the most normal thing ever. As the Liyue martial arts novels say: \"Wherever there are people, there will be conflict.\"\nPaimon: Wow, what a line. That's heavy... But the scholars in Sumeru probably don't duel like Liyue martial artists, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe they settle things with a game of Genius Invokation TCG.\nPaimon: Ohh, good point! A duel of wits!\nPaimon: Paimon can just imagine it: When one scholar can't convince another in an argument, he takes out his deck of cards, calmly sits down opposite his opponent, thinks for a moment, and then secures his victory!\n{NICKNAME}: That does sound like something that would happen in Sumeru.\nPaimon: The game ends, and the winner says \"good game\" as a sign of respect to his opponent. After that, both sides are back on good terms.\n{NICKNAME}: Um... saying that would probably only escalate the conflict.\nPaimon: Huh? Why?",
            "About Port Ormos\tPaimon: Whew, Port Ormos definitely has a different vibe to Sumeru City...\nPaimon: It's a bustling area, and there's so many outlanders. Plus, no one needs to spend all their time buried in their studies, which is nice.\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that's why they end up being disciplined by the port authorities. So you see, Paimon? If you don't study hard, you'll end up just like them!\nPaimon: Oh...\nPaimon: Wait! What was that tone of voice for!?",
            "About the Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys\tPaimon: Port Ormos is built on the ruins of the fortress of The Alliance of the... the... the alliance of something, anyway.\nPaimon: Ugh, the name's too long, Paimon can't remember it! Anyway, that's what all the bookish people in Sumeru say.\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, you mean \"The Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys\"?\n{NICKNAME}: Apparently, the alliance was formed by a bunch of arrogant pirate leaders, none of whom wanted to work for any of the others. They fought and looted each other constantly, causing endless chaos in coastal Sumeru...\n{NICKNAME}: Finally, one day, they decided to enter into an alliance with one another and divide power equally between themselves. The members of the alliance were called \"Deys\"...\nPaimon: Oh... And so after that... there was no more fighting and no more stealing, so everyone could get along happily and make a boatload of Mora together! Right?\n{NICKNAME}: ...\nPaimon: Right...?\n{NICKNAME}: Well... presumably that's what they were hoping...\nPaimon: Huh...?\n{NICKNAME}: Before long, they were forming factions again, and the infighting between them escalated into the biggest internal battle they'd seen yet. Their fortress at Port Ormos was completely destroyed, and all the Deys were done for!\nPaimon: Whaaat?\n{NICKNAME}: Following that, an unprecedented period of peace finally came to Port Ormos, and the area began to develop into what we see today...\nPaimon: Huh... So the Alliance was just a bunch of dumb bad guys...",
            "About Cyno and Genius Invokation TCG...\tPaimon: Cyno's super into that card game \"Genius Invokation TCG,\" isn't he?\nPaimon: Doesn't it seem kinda weird for the General Mahamatra to be into playing cards...?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... not when you consider his hairstyle.\nPaimon: Huh? What has his hairstyle got to do with it?\n{NICKNAME}: When you're playing a card game, the fancier your hairstyle, the more distracting it is for your opponent.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What's going on with this guy? How did he manage to shape his hair like that?\"\n{NICKNAME}: When your opponent's mind is consumed with thoughts like this, you'll quickly gain the upper hand.\nPaimon: Hmm, really? Then we'd better think twice before playing against him...\n{NICKNAME}: I don't know... I think I might just have an advantage over him.\nPaimon: But you don't have a fancy hairstyle at all. And your clothes look pretty normal too...\n{NICKNAME}: But I do have Paimon.\n{NICKNAME}: You know, he'd be like: \"What's up with this guy? And what's that pesky flying companion of his up to?\"\n{NICKNAME}: As long as you're floating by my side, Cyno's mind will be consumed with thoughts like this.\n{NICKNAME}: I, on the other hand, would be completely unfazed by his hairstyle. So I'd be able to focus, and victory would be mine.\nPaimon: Forget it! If you wanna play cards, go get a funny haircut!",

Good job, so you remember the tune as well!\n{NICKNAME}: Good job to you too, Paimon. You sing really well.\nPaimon: Heehee, that's because Paimon's got a great plan!\nPaimon: Have you heard this story? Once upon a time, there was a hilihound who was given meat to eat whenever the samachurls started dancing. Eventually, the hilihound started drooling whenever it heard the sound of dancing.\nPaimon: Whenever we hear the curry song, we get curry to eat. So, all Paimon has to do is learn the song by heart, and then in the future, whenever Paimon is craving a big bowl of tasty curry, all she has to do is sing it!\nPaimon: Hey, aren't you gonna say something?\nPaimon: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ Hungry children it's time to come home~ ♪",
            "About Aranara Tongue Twisters...\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, do you ever find that the word \"Aranara\" trips you up?\nPaimon: Hmm? Why, does it trip you up? Maybe that's because you don't really say anything most of the time.\nPaimon: Unlike Paimon! Paimon has to talk all the time, so she never gets stuck on words.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well, try reading this then.\nPaimon: What is it? Let's see here...\nPaimon: Arana the Aranara exercises Ararakalari in the nearby area.\nPaimon: Narana the Nara picks Padisarahs in a parallel area further afield.\nPaimon: Narana the Padisarah-picking Nara had arranged to invite Arana the Aranara to the bar to befriend Lambad, but alas, Arana the Ararakalari-exercising Aranara professed a preference to Padisarah-picking Nara, Narana, for venturing to Vanarana to view the panorama.\nPaimon: On account of Arana the Aranara's antipathy to bar drama, Narana the Nara relented and, upon accompanying the latter on a Vanarana-panorama adventure, encountered another Aranara, named \"Arama.\"\nPaimon: This must be one of those really weird dreams, right...\nPaimon: Ugh, but this headache feels pretty real...",
            "About the Prophesied Crisis...\tPaimon: Paimon just thought of a great way to deal with Fontaine's prophesied crisis!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, let's hear it.\nPaimon: You know those great big clockwork meka they use for digging tunnels? Well, why not send them deep underwater and get them to dig a load of drainage holes? Then no one'll have to worry about the water level rising anymore.\n{NICKNAME}: Sounds logical enough, but where do you think the water will go?\nPaimon: Ah, what does that matter! Think of it like... a coin pouch. When there's a hole in it, what's the use in racking your brains trying to figure out where all the Mora went? 'Cause the fact is, a coin pouch with a hole wouldn't be able to hold it all anyway.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'd certainly like to know where all my Mora goes. But from what you're saying, it doesn't sound like you keep track...\nPaimon: Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Paimon doesn't know where your... uh, P—Paimon doesn't know where your... Mora goes... hehe, heh...",
            "About Magic...\tPaimon: Lyney's magic shows are amazing! Paimon never would've guessed how he did it before he revealed his secret.\n{NICKNAME}: Hold on... I just thought of a magic trick!\nPaimon: Huh? You know how to do magic too?\n{NICKNAME}: Yep. I can make a big magician's hat float in the air, and even make it move at my command.\nPaimon: Whoa! Really? How do you do that?\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, simple! I put Paimon inside the hat.\nPaimon: What? Why would Paimon be... Ohhh, so Paimon's the one making it float!\nPaimon: Hehe, in that case, Paimon has an idea for an even better magic trick!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? What is it?\nPaimon: Behold, the bottomless hat! No matter how many plates of delicious food you throw into it, it'll never get full!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... Wait, so where would the plates go?\nPaimon: Oh, good point! Umm... Oh, the hat spits the empty plates back out! Tada! Whaddya think?",
            "About Patented Flying Technology...\tPaimon: Fontaine's aquabuses are pretty cool. But imagine if they could run without tracks. Then you could go anywhere you want pretty much without having to move a muscle! Traveling would be way less tiring.\n{NICKNAME}: But you already fly everywhere. Does that even get tiring?\nPaimon: Fly... Fly? Wait, that's it! If we could find a way to make the boats float in the air, then they wouldn't need rails anymore. Hehe, and we could call them \"airboats\"!\nPaimon: C'mon, let's go apply for one of those, uh... oh yeah — \"patents\"! We can't let Paimon's genius go to waste. Quick, before someone else beats us to it!\n{NICKNAME}: Patents don't work like that... You can't just have a name for your invention. You also need to provide details of the original technical solution that makes your airboats float.\nPaimon: Technical, huh? Hmm... Okay, got it! We just need to attach a giant propeller on top of the boats!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay... But how would you prevent the boat from spinning along with the propeller? And how would you control the direction of movement?\nPaimon: Um... Uh... Ugh. Paimon never realized flying was so complicated! It's always been second nature to Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Well, there might be an easier solution if we ditch the direction and speed control requirements?\nPaimon: Huh? Really!?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. It involves starting at a high altitude and flying downwards at a rapidly-increasing velocity.\nPaimon: Hey! That isn't flying, that's free-falling!",
            "About the Dark Side of Publishing...\tPaimon: The Steambird's Great Detective Hurlock series is gonna be published by Yae Publishing House, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Seems like it.\nPaimon: But The Steambird clearly doesn't need help with printing and distribution. Why don't they just publish it themselves?\n{NICKNAME}: Hehehe, you still have a lot to learn about the dark side of the publishing industry...\nPaimon: Ugh, okay, you know-it-all! Go on then, give Paimon one good reason why The Steambird can't publish its own novels, when it already publishes a newspaper that's read all over Teyvat.\n{NICKNAME}: Because the key to a successful light novel is...\nPaimon: Uh-huh?\n{NICKNAME}: The illustrations!\nPaimon: What!? No way. Try telling that to all the writers and editors in Teyvat! They're the ones working their butts off coming up with ideas!\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe so, but the Yae Publishing House has all the best illustrators on their payroll, and poaching them can't be easy. Artists like Calx must be virtually impossible to contact without going through them.\nPaimon: Ohhh... Yeah, that's a fair point.\n{NICKNAME}: Mm-hmm. But there's another reason, too...\nPaimon: Hm?\n{NICKNAME}: Only works published by the Yae Publishing House make it into Genius Invokation TCG crossovers!\nPaimon: Huh, Paimon never knew!\n{NICKNAME}: That's the deepest, darkest secret of the publishing industry: It's not about stories anymore, it's about products and how to commercialize them.\nPaimon: Hmph! That's just... sickening!",
            "About Armchair Detectives...\tPaimon: So apparently, some detectives in Fontaine manage to solve cases without ever setting foot outside their homes. They call them \"armchair detectives\"...\nPaimon: That's what they call \"working from home,\" right? Sounds pretty cushy.\nPaimon: Still, how do they figure out the truth if they never even go to the crime scene? ...Oh, Paimon knows! They must be using divination.\n{NICKNAME}: You're thinking of fortune-tellers, Paimon. Not detectives.\nPaimon: Oh... yeah...\n{NICKNAME}: In any case, surely the evidence isn't just dropping itself off at the detective's doorstep.\nPaimon: You mean... Oh, the detective must have people collecting information for them...\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps, or... Maybe they post commissions at the Adventurers' Guild?\nPaimon: Huh? But... that would mean the detective gets all the credit for our hard work! Bet they make a tidy sum of Mora off of it, too! Hmph, Paimon won't stand for that. Let's go have a little talk with Detective Armchair right now!",
            "About the Mysterious Treasure of the Fontaine Research Institute...\tPaimon: At the Fontaine Research Institute, they research clockwork and different energy sources, right? So how come there are rumors about a mystery treasure?\nPaimon: It'd make more sense if the treasure was owned by a bandit or a pirate.\nPaimon: But Paimon's not sure that the researchers' and technicians' definition of \"treasure\" is really mysterious enough to get excited about...\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... What about \"researcher by day, bandit by night\"? Does that sound mysterious enough?\nPaimon: Umm... Well for starters, it sounds exhausting. Imagine finishing your day job, then working a whole other job all night... When would they get time to rest?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe they wouldn't need to rest... If they were actually a clockwork meka in disguise!\nPaimon: Ooh! A mystery treasure left by a clockwork meka who's a researcher by day and a bandit by night... Now that sounds more like it!",
            "About the Big No-No of Detective Novels...\tPaimon: Detective stories like \"Great Detective Hurlock\" and \"The Case Files of Miss Orith\" are really popular in Fontaine.\n{NICKNAME}: They're also pretty complex. Can you even follow the plot?\nPaimon: Don't you underestimate Paimon! If Paimon read any of those novels, she'd definitely solve the mystery before she's even halfway through.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well if you do, then keep it to yourself. You don't want to spoil the story for anyone else.\nPaimon: Paimon would never do that!\n{NICKNAME}: Although you also have to watch out for people who use \"no spoilers\" as an excuse to shut down discussions, when the truth is, they're just annoyed that a story they can't stand is getting so much attention.\nPaimon: Huh. Well, Paimon doesn't read much, so she wouldn't know anything about that kinda thing.\n{NICKNAME}: You see it a lot when two fans of Onibudou get talking. Someone'll butt in and say something like, \"Stop, don't spoil it for me! I'm only up to chapter two of volume one!\"\nPaimon: Chapter two? Hah, yeah, clearly they have no intention of reading any further.\n{NICKNAME}Hey Paimon... You wanna hear a secret?\nPaimon: Um... sure?\n{NICKNAME}: Listen carefully...\nPaimon: Mm-hmm?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Zhongli is Rex Lapis.\nPaimon: *gasp* What a crazy twist! Why would you spoil— Wait a second, we figured out that one ages ago!",
            "About Claiming Self-Defense...\t{NICKNAME}: Pro tip. While we're in Fontaine, if someone ever picks a fight with you, you should never fight back unless there are witnesses around.\nPaimon: Huh? Why's that?\n{NICKNAME}: 'Cause without any evidence, the court'll probably reject your claim of self-defense, and they'll just rule that it was an intentional street fight.\nPaimon: Okay, and then what?\n{NICKNAME}: Well if that happens, you'll almost certainly end up having to duel before you're put to trial.\n{NICKNAME}: At that point, you'll either have to fight the same person all over again, or go head-to-head with their Champion Duelist.\nPaimon: ...Paimon just feels bad for whoever has to fight you.",
            "About The Steambird's Editors...\tPaimon: Pretty crazy how things that happened only yesterday show up in today's issue of The Steambird...\nPaimon: Even stuff that happened late at night way outside the city makes it in. How do they manage to get these articles written up so quickly?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, not to mention printed first thing in the morning.\nPaimon: Hehe, Paimon gets it! There must be a magic printer at The Steambird's office. As soon as the reporters bring in the latest news, they feed it to the printer, and it goes om-nom-nom-nom-nom, gobbling all the writing up ready to spit it back out when it's printing time!\nPaimon: They probably have some reporters bursting in through the doors at the last minute, yelling \"WAIT! There's one last article to feed to the printer!\"\n{NICKNAME}: That's definitely a very compelling image. But as far as I know, magic printers like that don't exist — it's all thanks to the tireless work of the editing team that The Steambird gets printed on time every day. They sit there going \"Huh? Hmph! Uhh... Oh no!\" as they race through correcting spelling errors, then they squeeeeeeeze it all into neat vertical columns of text, and run to their colleagues shouting \"Just give me five more minutes, please!\" That's the real magic behind meeting publishing deadlines.\nPaimon: Whoa... It's pretty amazing that they're able to make a whole newspaper in just one day. Do they ever get time to sleep?",
            "About Fontaine's Novels...\tPaimon: Huh, novels in Fontaine have weirdly long names. This one's called \"Do Clockwork Meka Dream of Cogwheel Chiropractors?\"\nPaimon: But the writing style and themes are pretty different from Inazuma's light novels.\n{NICKNAME}: According to the synopsis, this novel is about a clockwork meka experiencing back pain due to bending over for extended periods. It finally gives in, quits its job as an illustrator, then goes on a long journey looking for a chiropractor to cure its mechanical spine...\nPaimon: That actually sounds pretty interesting.\n{NICKNAME}: But why a chiropractor, though? Wouldn't an engineer do the job better? They could just go to the Fontaine Research Institute, and save themselves the long journey.\nPaimon: Well yeah, but... Having met some of the engineers from the institute, Paimon can see why they wouldn't want to...\n{NICKNAME}: Oh yeah, that's true. But anyway, even though the protagonist of the story is a clockwork meka, you can still tell that it was written by a human. Imagine if they got a real clockwork meka to write a novel... I wonder what they'd write about?\nPaimon: Hmm... How about this: \"I Awoke One Morning and Found Myself Human!\"\n{NICKNAME}: Hey, that's a good one, Paimon.",
            "About Trials and Shows...\tPaimon: The Opera Epiclese is used for both criminal trials and performances, so... wait...\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? What's bothering you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Well, what if someone did a show about a criminal trial there? How would the audience be able to tell whether it's a real trial or not?\n{NICKNAME}: That's a very good question. Can you imagine the looks that the actor playing the criminal would get out on the street the following day? Everyone who recognized them would say \"Hey! Weren't you the one on trial yesterday!?\"\nPaimon: Yeah, exactly! It would get sooo confusing!\n{NICKNAME}: The actor would constantly be telling everyone: \"It was just a show, for goodness' sake! Stop treating it like it's real!\"\nPaimon: Hmph, well they'd only have themselves to blame. What do they expect, staging a show about a trial in the Opera Epiclese? Clearly they're just trying to confuse people. What a terrible idea.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, it is a terrible idea. What were you thinking, Paimon!?\nPaimon: Wait, what? Nothing! Just... what a terrible idea it would be if... someone... came up with that idea...",
            "About Fonta...\tPaimon: Fonta tastes amazing, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Yep. It's so refreshing, especially when you down the whole thing in one big gulp.\nPaimon: Can you buy a glass for Paimon? Paimon's always wanted to try that thing.\n{NICKNAME}: What thing?\nPaimon: Just buy it, you'll see in a minute!\nPaimon: Glug glug glug glug...\nPaimon: Ahhhhh.\nPaimon: That's what those drunkards do after they clink their glasses together. Paimon's been itching to try it for ages!\n{NICKNAME}: Don't imitate them, Paimon... It's not a good look on you.",
            "About Gardemeks...\tPaimon: Gardemeks carry out whatever task they're programmed to do. So basically, they can do whatever you tell them to!\n{NICKNAME}: Got another bright idea, Paimon?\nPaimon: Yep! Paimon needs a commission-handling Gardemek, a material-harvesting Gardemek, and a domain-exploring Gardemek...\nPaimon: Ooh, and a gourmet-chef Gardemek, too! Then we can sit back and enjoy our new, fully automated lifestyle!\n{NICKNAME}: They're extremely expensive to own and operate, though. And don't forget there's maintenance and repair costs as well.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, lemme do some quick napkin-math here... Using a Gardemek, the average cost to harvest a single Mint would come to around 6,300 Mora...\nPaimon: What!? That's eye wateringly expensive...\nPaimon: ...Suddenly, Paimon feels like we adventurers don't get paid enough for the high-value work we do!",
            "About Diving...\tPaimon: Fontaine's underwater world is so pretty! There's so many kinds of fish that Paimon's never seen before.\n{NICKNAME}: If only we could swim underwater in other places too.\nPaimon: Yeah, it's a real shame...\nPaimon: If you could go diving anywhere you wanted, where would you choose?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Probably... either Liyue Harbor or Guyun Stone Forest.\nPaimon: Ooh, great idea! There's gotta be some sunken ships around there full of treasure! We could make a fortune!\n{NICKNAME}: Ooh, there's also Sangonomiya Shrine in Inazuma. The view underwater must be stunning around there. So, what about you, Paimon? Where would you go?\nPaimon: Let Paimon think... Well, since you already chose places in Liyue and Inazuma, Paimon's gonna go for... Cider Lake!\n{NICKNAME}: Not a bad choice. But you gotta be careful, because just when you're swimming along, minding your own business...\nPaimon: Y—Yeah?\n{NICKNAME}: Suddenly, you notice something slowly sinking in front of you...\nPaimon: Huh!?\n{NICKNAME}: It's round and chubby, with a red-and-white pattern on its surface. The moment you realize what it is, you know it's already too late...\nPaimon: A Jumpy Dumpty!\n{NICKNAME}: BOOM!\nPaimon: Waaaaaah! And Paimon goes flying into the sky!",
            "About Art...\tPaimon: There seems to be a lot of eccentric artists in the Court of Fontaine. Apparently, they often stage artistic performances at the opera house, too.\nPaimon: The people of Fontaine sure place a lot of importance on the arts. Guess that's why they call it the \"City of the Arts\"!\nPaimon: It's nothing like Sumeru, where people had to do their performances in secret...\n{NICKNAME}: You're pretty into the arts, huh?\nPaimon: Of course! Paimon's pretty much a connoisseur.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, so what makes something \"art\" in your opinion?\nPaimon: Well... Art should be something that's out of the ordinary. Something that sparkles like the stars at night!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... By that definition, I have a work of art following me around wherever I go.\nPaimon: ...Huh?\nPaimon: Wait... You don't mean Paimon, do you?\n{NICKNAME}: Yup! And now that I think about it, you should consider doing a performance some time. Paimon, live at the opera house... I bet a lot of people would go to see that.\nPaimon: No way! Not gonna happen!",
            "About Fixing Malfunctions...\tPaimon: You know what's strange? Clockwork meka are extremely intricate, and yet people regularly manage to fix them just by whacking them a few times. How does that work?\n{NICKNAME}: I guess if a gear or drive shaft comes loose, sometimes whacking it or giving it a shake is enough to make the parts latch back on to each other.\nPaimon: Huh? Paimon didn't follow that...\n{NICKNAME}: Well, simply put, if the meka isn't actually broken, a little tap can nudge the parts back into the right places.\n{NICKNAME}: But on the other hand, if one of the parts is damaged, then no amount of whacking is ever gonna fix it.\nPaimon: Ohh! So it's like knocking sense into people. It works fine as long as they've got a brain, and they're just having a dumb moment. But if they're a total airhead, there's nowhere for the sense to go!\nPaimon: ...Wait, why are you staring at Paimon's forehead?\n{NICKNAME}: Don't worry, I'm not gonna whack you in the head. It wouldn't work anyway.\nPaimon: Phew, well that's a relief— Wait... Hey!",
            "About the Fortress of Meropide...\tPaimon: So there's this place in Fontaine called the Fortress of Meropide. Was it named after someone called Meropide?\n{NICKNAME}: I've never heard anything about that, but you could be right.\nPaimon: Paimon's kinda envious. Having a building named after you must be an amazing feeling... When you have the time, can you build something in your Serenitea Pot and name it \"the Fortress of Paimon\"?\n{NICKNAME}: Sure. In fact, I can do one better — I'll build it in downtown Fontaine.\nPaimon: Really? But surely that'd be way too expensive. Are you sure you can afford it?\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, absolutely. It won't actually cost that much.\nPaimon: Wow, you're so generous! So, what're you gonna build...?\n{NICKNAME}: I was thinking a cozy little clay... bungalow, with a wood-burner for under-floor heating, a waterbed... a few chopped onions, salt and pepper, some greens... and, um...\nPaimon: Hey! Ugh, you are unbelievable! Can't we get through one nation without you cracking this stupid joke!?",
            "About Supermeka...\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that the earliest clockwork components ever invented actually work on a very simple principle!\nPaimon: You take a long object made from a durable material, bend it, and wait for it to return to its original shape. As it rebounds, you can use the energy it gives off to power gears and stuff, and then you basically have an engine!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... A long object made from a durable material... *gasp* You know what that reminds me of?\n{NICKNAME}: Cryo and Pyro Regisvines! Don't you think?\nPaimon: Eek! Of all the things you could've thought of, why those two?\nPaimon: Huh, but come to think of it, the regisvines are pretty good at whipping their stalks around...\n{NICKNAME}: And they're really strong too. If you let them charge up their energy and swing at you...\n{NICKNAME}: They'll knock down anyone in their path. Even me — and we both know how strong I am!\nPaimon: So are you saying that... you could turn the Regisvines into a clockwork mechanism?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, think about it. Since Cryo and Pyro lifeforms are highly incompatible, if we put them both next to each other at a slight incline, so their necks are tilted towards one another...\n{NICKNAME}: They'd spin non-stop to avoid touching each other!\n{NICKNAME}: It would be the world's most powerful clockwork mechanism! Once we found a way to harness it, it would generate enough energy to power most of the machines in Fontaine!\nPaimon: Ohhh! Yeah, you're right!\nPaimon: This is a genius idea! Eat your heart out, Fontaine Research Institute!\nPaimon: All we need to do now is find a way to bring the Regisvines to Fontaine, put them in position, and...\nPaimon: Wait a sec... How the heck are we gonna get those overgrown ferns to Fontaine?\n{NICKNAME}: As soon as we've tackled the minor issues of practicality and cost-effectiveness...\n{NICKNAME}: ...How about we explore the details ahead of us later?",
            "About Underwater Cafés...\tPaimon: Paimon thought we'd be saying goodbye to the amazing cafés after we left Sumeru. But it seems like people in Fontaine are big coffee drinkers too!\n{NICKNAME}: They sure are. Even the newspapers run articles about how great coffee is at keeping you awake and alert. And at boosting your energy levels, so you can keep performing at peak efficiency during a long working day.\nPaimon: Whew, any job where you need coffee to stay energized must be exhausting...\nPaimon: Like, umm... Blacksmiths? Maybe chefs too... And adventurers — they're always running around all over the place. Hey, and what about divers?\n{NICKNAME}: Divers, huh? That's definitely the odd one out here...\n{NICKNAME}: How are divers supposed to drink coffee when they work underwater the entire time?\nPaimon: Yeah, that's a good question!\nPaimon: They can't take off their helmets underwater, so they'd probably have to shut themselves inside an even bigger glass box and drain all the water out before they could finally drink their coffee. Probably from a bottle...\nPaimon: No, wait... If the coffee's already in a bottle, all they'd need is a long straw that goes from the bottle into their helmet. Then they'd be able to take a sip of coffee whenever they want!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, eww, haha. But then the coffee would go cold!\n{NICKNAME}: Cold coffee is just gross. With the important exception of iced coffee, but that's its own thing.\nPaimon: Well that's no problem. They can just bring a stove with them underwater.\nPaimon: You've seen the kind of stove that most people use in Fontaine, right? It only has one small opening up at the top. As long as that's sealed nice and tight, it won't go out even underwater!\nPaimon: Wait a second... No way, is that... That's it! That must be the whole reason stoves in Fontaine are made that way!\n{NICKNAME}: Ding ding ding, right answer! That is indeed the reason behind the design of the Fontaine-style stove.\nPaimon: Hehe, Paimon's the smartest!\nPaimon: Hey, how about we open an underwater café? Paimon bets there's lots of divers out there craving some coffee while they're down in the depths... Yeah, this could be a huge opportunity for us!\nPaimon: Once we open the world's first-ever underwater café, the Mora will come rolling in! Heck, and why stop at cafés? The ocean's our oyster! We could build a whole shopping mall down there! Then a whole underwater business district...\nPaimon: Hee-hee! Ah, it's gotta be the best feeling in the world, making Mora through your very own stroke of business genius!\n{NICKNAME}: Just one thing, okay? ...Don't go taking out a loan in my name!",
            "About The Steambird...\tPaimon: The Steambird's head office is in Fontaine, right? Paimon wonders what stories make it into their newspapers.\nPaimon: Do you think they reported on our adventures with Dvalin? Or our duel with the Raiden Shogun? Oh, and everything that happened at the Akademiya!\n{NICKNAME}: I'm sure they cover just about everything that goes on. It's more a question of where it would appear — they probably have different sections reserved for different topics.\nPaimon: Ooh, well in that case, we must make it onto the front page all the time! Surely that's where all the most exciting stories go.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... I'm not so sure. We might've made front-page news once or twice, I guess. But I wouldn't be surprised if the headlines focus mostly on hit new operas or well-known actors.\n{NICKNAME}: You know, stuff like, \"Actor X Spotted Drinking Coffee on Street,\" \"Actor Y Goes Public About New Relationship,\" or \"Actor Z to Retire From Performing.\"\nPaimon: Why would they fill the best page with stuff like that? It's completely pointless.\n{NICKNAME}: Well... trivial, maybe, but not pointless. Those are the stories that grab people's attention and convince them to buy the paper to get all the details.\nPaimon: *sigh* ...Fine. Well... Maybe we'll be on the first few pages then? Surely, they've gotta put some real news in there. And it's gotta be interesting enough to keep people reading after they've gotten their dose of celebrity gossip. Right?\n{NICKNAME}: The first few pages cover positive local news stories in the Court of Fontaine. Things like food and commodity prices going down, or progress updates on the aquabus expansions.\n{NICKNAME}: They put these reports at the most prominent locations inside the newspaper. The point of them is mostly just to kill time.\n{NICKNAME}: What goes on at the Akademiya might be important, but it doesn't directly impact the lives of people in Fontaine.\nPaimon: Huh... So, where would they put our stories then?\n{NICKNAME}: I'd guess on the very back page, after everything else.\nPaimon: Aww... Why so far back!?\n{NICKNAME}: I think they call it... \"saving the best till last.\"\n{NICKNAME}: The editors probably embellish things a lot to flesh the story out, then break it into several chunks to make it into a series that runs over several days.\nPaimon: Alright, so... what's the \"point\" of the final page, then?\n{NICKNAME}: It gives the newspaper its \"raison d'etre.\"",
            "About Clockwork Meka...\tPaimon: Paimon was not expecting to see clockwork meka dancing... As dangerous as it is to get too close to them, it sure is nice to watch them from a distance.\nPaimon: Hehe, imagine if they had ones that could sing and play musical instruments, too. That'd be really cool!\n{NICKNAME}: Then you'd just need some meka for the audience, and you'd have a show by meka, for meka.\nPaimon: Uhhh... Somehow, that's a pretty scary thought...\nPaimon: Anyway, meka are meant to do stuff, not sit there and watch a show... Ooh! How about meka that can paint? Paimon bets their paintings would look just like photos taken with a Kamera.\n{NICKNAME}: Sounds like you could just use a Kamera.\nPaimon: Oh, right, yeah... Hmm...\nPaimon: Ugh, Paimon's brain's stopped working. What about you? If you could make a clockwork meka do anything at all, what would it be?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Travel guiding, perhaps.\n{NICKNAME}: Bleep-blorp. This is your guidebot speaking. Please go straight on at the next crossroads. Bloop-blerp.\nPaimon: Uh, P—Paimon's just remembered how much training you need before you can own a clockwork meka! And how expensive they are! Also, who knows if they even work outside of Fontaine, heh...\nPaimon: The best travel guide in Teyvat will not lose her job to some machine! At least... at least not yet!",
            "About Fountains...\tPaimon: There always seems to be people throwing Mora into the fountain on Erinnyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. Supposedly, the fountain fairies listen to people's wishes. That's probably how the custom began.\nPaimon: Huh? So even fountain fairies need Mora?\nPaimon: Whoa, they must be living the dream! All they need to do is find a fountain to live in, and they're all set! No need to work, just sit back and wait for people to literally throw Mora to you.\n{NICKNAME}: I don't think that's quite how it works... You have to grant wishes, remember?\nPaimon: Oh, okay, well... \"Oh young traveler, your wishes have been heard. Which lost sword is it that you seek? The Dull Blade, or the Silver Sword?\"\n{NICKNAME}: They both look like trash, to be honest.\nPaimon: Just choose one.\n{NICKNAME}: \"Oh fair maiden of the fountain, neither of these swords is mine, and neither do I desire, for what I seek is my lost travel companion.\"\nPaimon: Huh? You... You are a sneaky one, young traveler... Okay then, the fountain fairy shall grant your wish and become your best travel companion ever!",
            "About Opera...\tPaimon: Operas in Fontaine come in so many different genres. Historical, myths and legends, even fairytales and modern romances...\n{NICKNAME}: And lots of adventure stories too.\nPaimon: Oh yeah, like \"Tancrede et Chariclea\"! Oh Tancrede, you fool! If only you'd recognized Chariclea before it was too late...\n{NICKNAME}: Apparently, the story's based on true events.\nPaimon: Ooh... Does that mean that there'll be opera adaptations of our adventures one day?\nPaimon: We've been through so many adventures together. There's gotta be a scriptwriter out there who's interested in taking our story to the stage!\nPaimon: And they won't have to worry about crafting the perfect tragedy, either. Everyone loves a happy ending, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Ooh, how about we get a head start and assign voices to ourselves?\nPaimon: Hmm... Paimon thinks you have a baritone voice. What do you think Paimon should be?\n{NICKNAME}: Remind me — what's that shrill voice that most prima donnas have?\nPaimon: Oh, you must be thinking of coloratura soprano— Hey!",
            "About Melusines...\tPaimon: Apparently, every Melusine gets their own special token when they're born. They treat it as a symbol of their very being.\n{NICKNAME}: If you were a Melusine, what would your token be?\nPaimon: Definitely a fork! To represent Paimon's lifelong mission to taste all the delicious food in the whole world!\n{NICKNAME}: Not Mora, then?\nPaimon: Ooh, good point... Yeah, if it were Mora, it'd mean that Paimon's destined to be a super rich person. Then Paimon could buy anything she wants!\nPaimon: Hmmmmm... Argh, Paimon's so torn! Both are so tempting...\n{NICKNAME}: How about a fork made from Mora? Then you can have your cake and eat it, so to speak.\nPaimon: Wow, that's a great idea!\nPaimon: Anyway, enough about Paimon. Your token would probably be... a cooking pot, to represent being Paimon's personal gourmet chef!\n{NICKNAME}: No no no, my token would be Paimon.\nPaimon: Aw, really?\n{NICKNAME}: With Paimon as my token, everything that you have would ultimately belong to me.\nPaimon: Uh... Okay sure. Friends share everything, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, yeah... My stuff would still be mine...\nPaimon: Hey, no fair!",
            "About the Palais Mermonia...\tPaimon: People in the city keep telling us how Palais Mermonia is a suuuper stressful place to work.\nPaimon: But when we went to see it for ourselves, it seemed like hardly anyone works there, and the few people who do work there were hardly working.\nPaimon: In fact, they looked like they didn't have a care in the world... What part of working there is supposed to be so stressful, exactly?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe the work they carry out is essential, but insignificant.\nPaimon: How can something be both of those things at the same time?\n{NICKNAME}: Well... Okay, so imagine that one day, you suddenly forgot how to fly and fell to the ground...\nPaimon: That'll never happen. Flying's a piece of cake for Paimon.\n{NICKNAME}: Probably not — but just in case, we should make sure that there's a cart loaded with cushions ready to catch you at all times.\n{NICKNAME}: The cart would have to be designed to withstand any environment and weather conditions, and the cushions would need to be soft enough to break your fall gently...\n{NICKNAME}: It would need to be built from the sturdiest timber and strongest rope, and packed with plenty of medical supplies and snacks...\n{NICKNAME}: And all because keeping Paimon safe and sound is absolutely essential.\nPaimon: You really mean that? Aw, thanks, hehe... But there's really no need to go to all that trouble.\nPaimon: Paimon's been flying for a really long time. There's no way Paimon's gonna suddenly drop out of the air. So you don't need to worry about it.\n{NICKNAME}: See? That's why it's insignificant.\n{NICKNAME}: If it ever did happen, the consequences would be disastrous — hence why it's essential to be prepared.\n{NICKNAME}: But practically speaking, the chances of it happening are next to nothing. So it's insignificant at the same time.\n{NICKNAME}: If someone in the Palais Mermonia was assigned a task like that, it'd be up to them to decide how busy they wanna get. Chances are, they'd probably just sit back and do nothing.\nPaimon: But... What if Paimon really does forget how to fly one day? What's gonna happen when Paimon falls to the ground?\n{NICKNAME}: I'll be here to catch you, no matter what. Because you're not \"essential but insignificant\" — you're the best travel companion ever!",
            "About the Children of Echoes' Gems...\tPaimon: Hey, so the valleys here are just bursting with shiny gemstones!\nPaimon: This could be a huge opportunity for us! We should get digging ASAP. With any luck, we'll hit the jackpot and we'll never have to worry about Mora again!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... But how would you actually know when you've hit the jackpot? Can you even tell which stones are the valuable ones?\nPaimon: Uhh, well... Paimon just figured... the shinier the stone, the more valuable it is! Yeah, that should be about right!\n{NICKNAME}: You're starting to sound like an evil fairytale dragon, hoarding all the shinies they can get their greedy claws on...\nPaimon: Hehe, except we're in Natlan now — so instead of \"evil dragon,\" it's \"noble Saurian\"!\nPaimon: \"O brave and cunning {NICKNAME}, follow this noble Saurian, for she shall lead you to the most precious gemstone in the entire world!\"\n{NICKNAME}: Great! Except she can't tell which stones are the valuable ones, so how's that gonna work?",
            "About the Scions of the Canopy...\tPaimon: The Scions of the Canopy sure do love their extreme outdoor sports. Seems like they have a real appetite for danger.\nPaimon: Free solo climbing, skysurfing, volcano parkour, bungee jumping off cliffs... Whew, even the thought of it makes Paimon light-headed!\n{NICKNAME}: Really? Honestly, some of the stuff we've done is at least as dangerous as that... We froze half to death on Dragonspine, narrowly avoided being fried in all those thunderstorms, got sandblasted in the scorching desert, stared death in the face in those eerie Withering Zones... The list goes on.\nPaimon: Huh, when you put it like that... Yeah, we've been through some pretty extreme stuff.\n{NICKNAME}: Mhm, but we're built different. Most people's idea of \"danger\" is probably just an average day on the road for us. That's probably how it is for the Scions of the Canopy with their extreme sports as well.\nPaimon: Whoa, wait a second! Let's get one thing straight: YOU might be built different, but Paimon sure as heck isn't.\nPaimon: Now, Paimon's sure you and your danger-braving buddies know what you're doing, but the second we find ourselves in serious trouble, Paimon's gonna... hide behind you until it's over.",
            "About the Hot Springs of Natlan...\tPaimon: The People of the Springs are so chill. If they're not relaxing in a hot spring, they're planning their next big soak...\n{NICKNAME}: Apparently, some of them even hire musicians to play some relaxing music while they take a dip. The warm water relaxes the body, and the soothing music relaxes the mind...\nPaimon: Whoa, that sounds so nice, Paimon wants to try it for herself...\n{NICKNAME}: Alright. Well, next time you visit the hot springs, I'll play some Aranara music for you.\nPaimon: Ooh~ ...Um, but Paimon doesn't play any instruments, so what happens when it's your turn to go in the spring?\n{NICKNAME}: You can sing me a song. Maybe... an opera from Fontaine?\nPaimon: That's way too hard! Also — not exactly relaxing! That kind of music will put your blood pressure through the roof!\nPaimon: How about some Natlan rap instead? Paimon's been practicing, check this out:\nPaimon: \"Hey! Flyin' in your face, it's Paimon the guide, no stranger to danger, takes it in her stride...\"\nPaimon: \"Saw a beast called blubber in the nation of water, my Guhua brother got his weapons in order, sword in one hand and a spear in the other...\"\n{NICKNAME}: Wow, very smooth!\n{NICKNAME}: If I was listening to that in a hot spring, I'd be tapping the water to the beat like a drum.\nPaimon: Yeah, it'd be like a big music festival! And anyone who's late to the party, the rhythm of the water would get them right into the groove!\n{NICKNAME}: Uhhh... Wait, didn't we start this by saying how the hot springs are meant to be relaxing?",
            "About the Collective of Plenty...\tPaimon: Don't you think those masked warriors look super cool?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, really gives them an air of mystery.\nPaimon: Right!? Don't you think Paimon should get in on this too? Put on a mask and win some wrestling matches with the Collective of Plenty? She could make a whole new name for herself!\nPaimon: Paimon's even thought of some catchphrases, get this: \"A Saurian warrior never removes her mask!\"\nPaimon: Famous adventurer by day, mighty Saurian warrior by night. Does that sound cool or what!?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, it does, but there's just one problem...\nPaimon: Hmm? What's that?\n{NICKNAME}: You'll just look like Paimon in a mask. No air of mystery there.",
            "About Woven Goods...\tPaimon: Here in Natlan, they seem to use woven scrolls where most nations would use books. It feels so different reading off of them.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. They say it started with the Masters of the Night-Wind, when the Shamans began recording their tribal history and legends on woven material. As the practice became more widely adopted, the number and variety of stories grew.\nPaimon: Ooh, Paimon should make a record of all our adventures as well! That way, if you ever start a tribe called the Travelers, you'll have your very own historical record!\nPaimon: Plus, it could make a really cool cape. And an extra blanket when you're camping in the wild...\n{NICKNAME}: That would make for one \"weathered\" chronicle.",
            "About the Collective of Plenty and the Flower-Feather Clan...\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that everyone from the Collective of Plenty is built like a bricklayer!\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe you should go stay with them for a while. Grow those muscles out.\nPaimon: No! Paimon likes herself the way she is now.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, then what about staying with the Flower-Feather Clan instead? Their thing is flying. I bet they could help you sharpen your skills!\nPaimon: Huh? But... isn't Paimon good enough at flying already?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, but then you'd be able to carry me when you fly.\nPaimon: Nope, not happening! How would that even be possible?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, if you had those muscles I talked about...\nPaimon: Oh, geez, not this again... For the last time, no!",
            "About Ways to Make Friends With Saurians...\tPaimon: Oooh, there are so many cute Saurians in Natlan! Paimon's gonna make friends with every single one!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh? Someone sounds confident...\nPaimon: You bet! Paimon's got it all figured out!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh you do, huh? Come on then, what's the secret to making Saurian friends?\nPaimon: It's really simple! First, you've gotta sweet-talk them, show 'em you mean well so they relax their defenses. Then, you gently pat them on the head — that makes them feel more comfortable around you.\nPaimon: Last but not least: Get 'em some good grub! The way to a Saurian's heart is through the stomach, after all! What do you think? Solid plan, huh?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, what do I think... I think that all of these tactics would also work really well on you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Would not! Paimon can't be won over by some cheap tricks!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? Oh, you misunderstand! I meant to say that you're as cute as a baby Saurian!\nPaimon: Hah! Flattery, really? You think that'll work on Paimon? Think again!\n{NICKNAME}: But I was being sincere, Paimon! Ah, how can I prove it to you? With some Sweet Madame, perhaps?\nPaimon: ...Wait, really? Sweet Madame? Oh, heck yes! Paimon could totally go for some of that right now!\nPaimon: ...Uhh... What's with that smug look on your face? ...What!? Is Paimon missing something?",
            "About Archaeology...\tPaimon: Word is that speed's of the essence when doing archaeology work with the Children of Echoes. Why's that?\n{NICKNAME}: It's probably because this place is absolutely overflowing with relics...\nPaimon: Uh, but isn't that a good thing?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, more relics means more competition! Imagine you saw a really cool stone slate one day, and planned to come back and grab it the day after — only to show up the next day and find someone else had already beaten you to it!\nPaimon: Um, Paimon still doesn't get it...\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, here's another analogy: Imagine one night you're all ready to dig in to a delicious snack... but then you find a piece of it's missing!\nPaimon: Ahh! Yeah, that'd be terrible!\nPaimon: ...Wait a sec, that's exactly what happened last night... Anything you wanna confess, {NICKNAME}?",
            "About Resolving Conflicts...\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that even in Natlan, there are lots of ways to resolve conflict that don't involve contests of strength.\n{NICKNAME}: Really? In the Nation of War?\nPaimon: Yeah! Like, apparently, some people in the Children of Echoes settle their disputes by holding a dance-off!\n{NICKNAME}: A dance-off? So, they mutually decide on a time and place...\nPaimon: Uh-huh!\n{NICKNAME}: And just dance their socks off?\nPaimon: Mm-hmm!\n{NICKNAME}: Until one person gets so exhausted, they can't get up anymore?\nPaimon: Yep!\nPaimon: ...Wait, what the... Hold on, that IS a contest of strength!",
            "About Ways to Make a Fortune...\tPaimon: Guess what? Paimon just thought of the best Mora-making idea ever!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh? Do tell.\nPaimon: Just look at how many people pass by this place every day. If we opened a business here, right outside the Stadium, we'd make a fortune without even trying!\n{NICKNAME}: So... What would you sell?\nPaimon: Uhhh... maybe... alchemical potions from Mondstadt?\n{NICKNAME}: I think there's already people selling similar stuff...\nPaimon: In that case, ummm... Ooh! Ores from Liyue! Yeah, we could make a killing off of those!\n{NICKNAME}: Pretty sure the Children of Echoes are already in that business, too...\nPaimon: Yeah... Wait, Paimon's got it — rugs from Sumeru! Those'll definitely be a hit!\n{NICKNAME}: Unfortunately, that's the specialty of the Masters of the Night-Wind.\nPaimon: Well then... we'll fence the whole Stadium up! And charge an admission fee to everyone who tries to get inside, whether they're a contestant or a spectator!\n{NICKNAME}: You'll be locked up before your fence is even half-finished...\nPaimon: Grrrrrrrr! Why does getting rich have to be so hard?",
            "About Saurian Stylists...\tPaimon: Paimon will never forget the first saurians we saw in Natlan. They're just fascinating creatures.\nPaimon: There was the Tepetlisaurs with their bouncy heads, the Koholasaurs with their smooth backs, and then the Yumkasaurs with their fluffy ears and heads.\n{NICKNAME}: I bet a baby Yumkasaur would make the best teddy bear...\nPaimon: Yeah... Hey, their fur probably keeps growing out as they get older, right? Do you think it starts getting in the way eventually?\nPaimon: Like, imagine if a Yumkasaur had really long fur around the ears and head... they'd barely be able to see where they're going. And that could be kinda dangerous...\n{NICKNAME}: You seem to have thought a lot about this. Are you planning on becoming a saurian hairstylist?\nPaimon: Uh... Are you serious?\n{NICKNAME}: Just think about it. Once you get famous, you'll be rolling in Mora!\nPaimon: Oh... You're right! This is it, this is how Paimon makes her fortune!\nPaimon: Paimon's gonna become the hairstylist for every Yumkasaur in Natlan! Hehehe, so much Mora...\nPaimon: No, wait, the Mora's secondary! The best part of this plan is making friends with all the Yumkasaurs! Life will be sooo happy!\n{NICKNAME}: But they're big, you know. It's gotta take a long time to style all that fur with just an ordinary pair of scissors. You might find you can only take one customer per day...\n{NICKNAME}: If you're serious about this stylist business, you'd better start building some strength! At the very least, aim to lift a pair of scissors as big as the Dull Blade!\nPaimon: The Dull Blade? But isn't that your weapon?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, but I can let you borrow it for training. Come on! Let's get practicing!\nPaimon:  Hey... This isn't \"training,\" this is \"give Paimon the sword and let her fight the monsters instead\"! Paimon did not sign up for this!",
            "About Ancient Names...\tPaimon: So in Natlan, warriors who impress the Wayob enough get an Ancient Name. Paimon's so jealous! Having an Ancient Name would be so cool!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? Don't you already have a bucket load of titles, Paimon?\nPaimon: Hmm? Oh wait... Yeah, you're right!\nPaimon: Paimon's your \"best travel companion\" and \"trusty guide,\" plus she's the \"Trendy Flyer,\" \"Silver Companion,\" and \"Assistant to the Honorary Senior Researcher\"... Heck yeah, Paimon's an actual legend!\nPaimon: If the people of Natlan end up making a record of our adventures, Paimon's gonna make sure they use every single one of those titles!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? But wouldn't that make everything too long?\n{NICKNAME}: Just think about it. If the locals also used all of their names, records would look something like:\n{NICKNAME}: On this day, \"Uthabiti\" Kachina of the Children of Echoes, otherwise known as the Nanatzcayans, and \"Umoja\" Mualani of the People of the Springs, of Meztli fame, encountered \"Malipo\" Kinich of the Scions of the Canopy of Huitztlan, traveling alongside his impish partner, K'uhul Ajaw, while on their way to the Masters of the Night-Wind in Mictlan...\nPaimon: Okay, okay, you can stop now! Geez, with a document that long, it'd stretch from here to the Stadium and back... and that's before it even got to the point!\nPaimon: Well, if Paimon had to pick just one out of all her titles... Yep, it'd have to be: \"Best companion ever\"!",
            "About the Stadium of the Sacred Flame...\tPaimon: So just between the two of us... Paimon's been wondering about something. It's to do with the competitions at the Stadium.\nPaimon: You know how there's a point system? First everyone fights in teams, then for the teams that make it through, there's a set number of one-on-one matches, and after that, everyone's ranked based on their final scores.\nPaimon: Why did they structure it like that?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe it's to maintain suspense until the final round? Everyone loves to see the underdog make a comeback at the last minute.\nPaimon: Could be, could be... Or maybe it's because they wanna avoid a situation where there's only two contestants and they're evenly matched?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah... They'd end up having to call it a draw and quit.\nPaimon: Exactly! It'd be like pitting the most aggressive Tatankasaur against the most slippery Yumkasaur. Tatankasaur attacks, Yumkasaur dodges, and so on and so forth, until a whole day and night has passed...\nPaimon: By this point, the audience is starving, so they end the fight and agree to a round two some other time.\nPaimon: But round two comes and goes, and there's still no clear winner. This time, the fight only ends because the Yumkasaur makes an illegal surprise attack and injures the Tatankasaur.\nPaimon: ...Before long, we've ended up with \"Tatanka vs. Yumka,\" \"Tatanka vs. Yumka 2,\" \"Tatanka vs. Yumka: Return of the Sacred Scales,\" \"Tatanka vs. Yumka: Over the Volcano\"... and the sequels show no signs of stopping.\nPaimon: ...Wait, we should totally get those made into a film series! We'd make a ton of Mora.\n{NICKNAME}: Not a bad idea... Although, I don't think the Scions of the Canopy would be too too happy about you making their Saurian the villain!\nPaimon: Alright, well you pitch an idea then, if you're such a film critic!",
            "About Natlan's Adventurers...\tPaimon: The Natlanese don't seem to leave Natlan much, do they?\n{NICKNAME}: Nope, and there are some good reasons for that.\nPaimon: Hmm... That must make things pretty difficult for anyone who wants to be an adventurer, huh?\nPaimon: Think about it — if they can't go to other nations, they miss out on a ton of potential commissions. If they can't go exploring unknown ruins, surely they can't make a whole lot of Mora... It's too bad.\n{NICKNAME}: You'd think so, wouldn't you? But in fact, they've found ways around it.\nPaimon: Huh?\n{NICKNAME}: I've heard of a group in the People of the Springs who call themselves \"wayfinders.\" They have a wealth of knowledge about Natlan's geography and ancient ruins, so a lot of foreign adventurers hire them as guides when they visit.\n{NICKNAME}: Of course, that means they get paid for each trip, regardless of whether their client actually finds the treasure. So in the long run, they might actually earn more than a traditional adventurer would.\nPaimon: Wow, okay... But wait — if they know so much about Natlan's ancient ruins, why don't they just go find the treasure themselves?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, here's the thing... What if there never was any treasure to begin with?\nPaimon: Whoa... Okay, Paimon's gonna need a minute to let that sink in...",
            "About Graffiti...\tPaimon: The Natlanese seem to do a lot of doodling everywhere. Except they don't call it \"doodling,\" do they? They call it, uh... flow-something?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Phlogiston engraving.\" But strictly speaking, that refers to the engraving of special stone tablets. What you're talking about is just regular graffiti.\n{NICKNAME}: Take this one, for example. It basically just says, \"You're in Nanatzcayan territory now! Children of Echoes for the win!\"\nPaimon: That's pretty fun! Now Paimon wants in. Shall we do some graffiti of our own?\n{NICKNAME}: We sure can. But what do you think we should draw?\nPaimon: Well that's easy — a portrait of the best travel guide in all of Teyvat! Now let's see... Ah, there! Put it right there on that cliff face.\n{NICKNAME}: So you want me to do the honors, huh? Alright then, lemme think about this... Yep, first we need to capture that classic Paimon facial expression: seething with rage...\nPaimon: Mhm-hmm— Wait, what!? Grr... You know what, forget it! Paimon has decided to find a professional Natlanese graffiti artist instead!",
            "About Saurian Companions...\t{NICKNAME}: The Natlanese seem to have a genuinely close relationship with their saurians.\nPaimon: Yeah! They're true companions, just like us. Inseparable wherever they go!\n{NICKNAME}: So... let's say there was a competition between you and the saurians. Who do you think would win the title of champion companion?\nPaimon: Huh? What sort of a question is that!?\n{NICKNAME}: I mean, the more I think about it, it's like... You can't burrow into the ground like the tepetlisaurs, and you don't fly as fast as the qucusaurs...\nPaimon: H—Hey! Y—You're thinking about this all wrong! For starters, Paimon flies way faster than any tepetlisaur, and she's better than the qucusaurs at, uh... at picking out the tastiest Chicken-Mushroom Skewer from the grill!\n{NICKNAME}: And most importantly of all, Paimon has been at my side longer than any saurian.\nPaimon: Exactly! Let's not forget who's the best travel guide in all of Teyvat, hehe!\n{NICKNAME}: Alright, my trusty companion, shall we set off on our next adventure?\nPaimon: Um, actually, now that Paimon's mentioned it, she feels like her Chicken-Mushroom-Skewer-picking-out skills have gotten a little rusty... C'mon, you should cook up a few so Paimon can practice!",
            "About Ajaw...\tPaimon: Paimon's been dying to hear your thoughts about this... What is the deal with Ajaw? And don't say you haven't noticed.\n{NICKNAME}: Noticed what?\nPaimon: ...! Try everything! He's completely different from every other Saurian! For starters, he can talk — matter of fact, he never shuts up! Also, he's always hovering around Kinich instead of walking on the ground. Oh, and don't get Paimon started on those stupid sunglasses! Why would a Saurian wear sunglasses? It doesn't make any sense!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm...\nPaimon: Why are you looking at Paimon like that...?\n{NICKNAME}: It's just... You talk a lot too, and you fly, plus... didn't you get yourself a pair of silly-looking glasses in Fontaine?\nPaimon: ...That is completely different!\nPaimon: But anyway, there's a more glaring issue here... Ajaw is flat as a pancake! He's floating around looking like a little cardboard cutout, and no one in Natlan bats an eyelid! Don't you think that's strange?\n{NICKNAME}: It's definitely unusual. Then again, maybe everyone's just used to it by now.\n{NICKNAME}: Ultimately, it nobody's business but Ajaw's, so if you want answers, you'd probably have to ask him.\nPaimon: But would he even tell us the truth? Paimon gets the feeling he'd just make up a bunch of phony-baloney to get us off his case...\nPaimon: *gasp* Or maybe... He'd be like, \"Okay, if you really wanna know... I'll show you!\" And then poof! He'd turn us into cardboard cutouts too!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... Cardboard-cutout Paimon, now that I would love to see, hehehe...\nPaimon: Hey... Cut it out! Paimon doesn't wanna be flat as a pancake...",
            "About Natlan's Body Painting Practices...\tPaimon: Have you noticed the... makeup that Natlanese people wear? Or body paint, or tattoos, or graffiti, or whatever it's called — anyway, it looks really cool!\n{NICKNAME}: I have noticed! \"Body paint\" is right, although it's not just any old paint. Apparently, it contains phlogiston.\nPaimon: Wow, really?\n{NICKNAME}: Yep. If you're interested to try it out, I'm pretty sure they offer a body painting experience specially for tourists — but they just use normal paint for that.\nPaimon: Ooh! Well, since we're here... why don't we try it? All part of the experience.\n{NICKNAME}: Sure thing. You'll need to pick a color palette and a motif first though. Each tribe has its own style.\nPaimon: Alright, Paimon chooses, uh... Paimon chooses... Ugh! They all look so cool! Choosing between them is impossible.\nPaimon: Meh, choosing is losing! Paimon will take them all!\n{NICKNAME}: Wow... Today I learned that Paimon is a maximalist... Well, I'm sure some people would say \"less is more,\" but I say — you do you, Paimon!\nPaimon: What are you talking about!? Paimon never said anything about using them all at once! She just wants options, so she can switch up her style every day!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Oh. That's too bad... I woulda loved to see Paimon with an elaborate arm-tattoo...\nPaimon: Stop! Nope! Stop it! No imagining Paimon with an arm-tattoo! Not allowed!",
            "About Living With Saurians...\tPaimon: The people and saurians of Natlan have a great relationship, huh? They live together, fight together, even fly together...\n{NICKNAME}: Just like us, right? Except you're too small to take me flying... It's just a shame you can't grow any bigger. Not for want of trying, of course — you do eat a lot of Chicken-Mushroom Skewers...\nPaimon: Hmph... Let's not forget that saurians can't be your guide. Or your conversation partner.\n{NICKNAME}: It's strange to think that there was once a time when humans and saurians were enemies. And now they co-exist peacefully. Must've taken a lot of work to get to where things are today.\nPaimon: If Paimon was a saurian, all it would have taken is some tasty food.\n{NICKNAME}: You say that, but... what if you demanded a hundred chicken skewers per day, and the humans couldn't provide that much?\nPaimon: Umm... Paimon could probably settle for fifty a day...\n{NICKNAME}: Or even better — maybe the humans could team up with you and you could go hunting together. Then there'd be enough meat for everyone to eat their fill!\nPaimon: Uh-huh! Peace between species all starts with a full stomach!",
            "About the Volcano...\tPaimon: That Volcano is so huge, you can see it from anywhere in Natlan... Where do you think all that magma comes from, though?\n{NICKNAME}: One legend holds that an enormous Pyro Dragon slumbers in the deepest depths of Natlan. Within the dragon's body dwells the world's first flame, burning eternally, and causing boils to form on the dragon's back. Every once in a while, these boils spew out fire, which takes the form of magma when it comes above ground.\nPaimon: For real!? But... what happens if the dragon ever wakes up? Natlan will be doomed!\n{NICKNAME}: Yep, and that's why the Pyro Archon gets the tribes to periodically join forces and go pacify the dragon, to make sure it stays asleep.\nPaimon： ...Wait, what? No, that's to fight the Abyss! Isn't it?\n{NICKNAME}： ...Well, not if this story from a woven scroll I bought on the street is to be believed.\nPaimon： Ugh, Paimon knew it!",
            "About the Windmills\tPaimon: Mondstadt has so many windmills, doesn't it?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, the city is built above water, so it probably relies on windmills to draw the water upwards.\nPaimon: That's correct! The winds blow through Mondstadt all year, so this supply of water is very stable.\nPaimon: Also, the windmills are what they call \"visible winds\" — and wind chimes are called the \"audible winds.\"\nPaimon: Paimon guesses they can be thought of as mascots and prayers to the Anemo Archon for protection.\n{NICKNAME}: Ah, mascots. So, like you then, Paimon?\nPaimon: No! Not at all! They're made of wood, and you can't eat them in an emergency either, 'cause all you'll do is grind your teeth down!\n{NICKNAME}: Umm...\n{NICKNAME}: ...I don't know what to say to that.",
            "About the Tavern Owner\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that if you give tavern owners a considerable tip, they'll be willing to share some information on the down low.\nPaimon: You mean the Angel's Share? But Master Diluc seems like a very rich man.\nPaimon: How big a tip is \"considerable,\" anyway?\n{NICKNAME}: Huh... Maybe I might have heard wrong.\n{NICKNAME}: Or, maybe I might have heard this rumor in another world...\nPaimon: You sure have been to many worlds, haven't you?",
            "About Cider Lake\tPaimon: Cider Lake never freezes, no matter what time of year it is.\nPaimon: The best apple ciders in Mondstadt can only be made using the fresh water from this lake.\nPaimon: It really does taste great! Paimon could drink two big bottles in a second!\n{NICKNAME}: Wow.\nPaimon: Tee-hee!\n{NICKNAME}: With your size, I can't believe that you can drink that much liquid...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And not explode like an Anemo Slime.\nPaimon: Paimon has a special stomach just for tasty drinks!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh... I guess the world really is a big place. So many things to consider...",
            "About the Library's Restricted Section\t{NICKNAME}: About those books in the \"restricted section\" that Lisa mentioned...\n{NICKNAME}: Have you ever wondered what sort of books might be kept in there?\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps...\n{NICKNAME}: ...It contains books not suitable for children?\nPaimon: Huh? But \"The Boar Princess\" isn't in the restricted section!\nPaimon: What could be more unsuitable for children than that? ...Hmm, Paimon's curious...",
            "About Effort and Reward\tPaimon: Paimon finds that hard work hardly works here in Mondstadt.\n{NICKNAME}: Why do you say that?\nPaimon: Just look at Huffman from the Knights of Favonius. He does his best at his duties every day...\nPaimon: But the ever-relaxed Captain Kaeya is his boss.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... But isn't Jean, who works the hardest, the Acting Grand Master?\nPaimon: W—Well, how about this, then...\nPaimon: Venti's the god of Mondstadt, and he's the laziest of them all!",
            "About the Goth Grand Hotel\t{NICKNAME}: Ah... Sure would be nice to spend a night at the Goth Grand Hotel...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks so too!\nPaimon: The rooms are sure to be big and clean.\n{NICKNAME}: Still, I've heard Mr. Goth say that they've had all kinds of strange problems ever since the Fatui moved in.\n{NICKNAME}: The Electro Cicins that their mages brought in attracted a lot of dust with static electricity, which ended up killing a lot of those Cicins.\n{NICKNAME}: Then, someone mixed up the Mist Grass Pollen and the pepper...\n{NICKNAME}: And the Agents ended up brawling amongst themselves, each insisting that the other owed them money for wine.\nPaimon: ...Hang in there, Goth Grand Hotel...",
            "About the Way the Wind Blows\t{NICKNAME}: Everyone says that Mondstadt is the land of the wind.\n{NICKNAME}: But, I wonder which direction the seasonal winds come from.\nPaimon: Why don't we ask Venti?\n{NICKNAME}: He'll probably just dodge the question with a \"hehe\" or something...\nPaimon: True. The Anemo Archon is just a Tone-Deaf Bard. What does he know about the wind?",
            "About Alchemy\t{NICKNAME}: So here in Mondstadt, alchemy is practiced out on the streets?\nPaimon: Is that so strange?\n{NICKNAME}: In many of the worlds I've been to in the past, alchemy has always been a secretive art.\n{NICKNAME}: Watching alchemy being practiced as a part of daily life is like being in a world where people all have three stomachs...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks only having one stomach is weird!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh...\n{NICKNAME}: Are you serious?\nPaimon: What do you think?",
            "About Teyvat\t{NICKNAME}: Teyvat's day and night both seem particularly short.\n{NICKNAME}: The skies here are full of stars, but they aren't the same as the ones back home.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder if the fates of people from Teyvat are also related to their constellations.\nPaimon: Oh? Do you know how to read the stars, too? That's amazing! Not a lot of people outside Sumeru can do it.\nPaimon: Paimon's curious! Come on, do a reading for me, quick!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm...\n{NICKNAME}: The night sky pictured on Paimon's cape... flows with the light of many stars, and also of the deep ocean...\n{NICKNAME}: The movement of these stars... tells me that, uh... in, say, seven days from now...\nPaimon: ...In seven days what?\n{NICKNAME}: Something good, or something bad, might occur...\nPaimon: Heh, right... your theory sounds as rock solid as a Geo Slime... And about as brainy, too.",
            "About the God of Freedom\t{NICKNAME}: On the way back to Mondstadt after rescuing Dvalin...\n{NICKNAME}: We finally got to see one of the Seven Archons, didn't we? It was interesting to see what kind of god he was.\nPaimon: Hmm... Haven't we known Venti for quite a while now?\n{NICKNAME}: As Venti, yes... But still, this was the first time that we got to see him as the Anemo Archon, Barbatos.\n{NICKNAME}: Normally, he hides his true divinity behind the facade of a bard.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What does freedom really mean, when demanded of you by a god?\"\n{NICKNAME}: That was the question that he asked Dvalin... I'm still contemplating that... you know?",
            "About Mondstadt's Terrain\tPaimon: Mondstadt is full of wide plains and rolling hills.\nPaimon: People say that when Barbatos made this land, he used the storm to flatten the cliffs and valleys...\n{NICKNAME}: Still, it looks like he missed a few spots.\nPaimon: Like Starsnatch Cliff?\n{NICKNAME}: Exactly.\n{NICKNAME}: On the map, it almost looks as if it was meant to be the apex of a vertical structure, but ended up at the wrong orientation.\nPaimon: Wh—What's an \"apex\"?",
            "About Couplets\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that couplets are a traditional art form in Liyue. If you can write a line that works as a second half to one that someone else has written, you'll be well paid!\nPaimon: But linking the couplet is hard, so it's not easy money.\nPaimon: Not only does the rhythm need to match, but the meaning has to as well.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Care to give an example?\nPaimon: Uh... \"Windrise's winds never churn.\"\n{NICKNAME}: ...Um, \"But the Sea of Clouds' clouds always return.\"\nPaimon: Huh... Not bad!\nPaimon: Let's not waste time here. We've got some money to make!",
            "About \"Don't Play With Food, or With Money\"\tPaimon: There's a saying of Rex Lapis' that's commonly used here in Liyue. Paimon thinks its rough meaning is... \"Don't play with your money.\"\nPaimon: It's because the first Mora were minted from his golden form and given to humans in trust.\n{NICKNAME}: Kaeya sure seems to enjoy playing with his money...\nPaimon: And that's why you shouldn't learn from him.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, as a child, I was taught not to play with my food.\nPaimon: Yup, yup. You've got to respect your food.\nPaimon: ...Wh—What are you looking at Paimon for?",
            "About Heart's Desire\tPaimon: Walk in seven clockwise circles, then walk in seven anticlockwise circles, then open your eyes...\n{NICKNAME}: Are you... sleepwalking?\nPaimon: Nope! Paimon is just trying to see if that antique shop from \"Heart's Desire\" actually exists!\n{NICKNAME}: Well, assuming that a shop in a story does exist, what would you like to buy, Paimon?\nPaimon: A Slime Creator!\n{NICKNAME}: Does such a thing even exist?",
            "About the Guhua Clan\t{NICKNAME}: Lately, some Guhua Clan disciples have been retelling an ancient story.\nPaimon: The Guhua Clan, huh? Paimon bets it's a heroic story!\n{NICKNAME}: Several female disciples decided to partake of a contest of arms to see who would marry their male junior, and he approved.\nPaimon: Ooh, Paimon's heard this one. In Liyue, they call this \"a joust for a spouse\"!\n{NICKNAME}: But the night before the contest, he stole the eldest disciple's favorite sword.\nPaimon: Ah, so he wanted her to lose... Poor girl...\n{NICKNAME}: I know, right? Forced to use a sword she wasn't used to, the eldest disciple suffered a crushing defeat.\n{NICKNAME}: Unable to accept this result, she fell to her knees and wept.\nPaimon: Oh no... She must have really loved him, right?\n{NICKNAME}: In the end, she was forced to marry him in front of everyone. Hahaha.\nPaimon: Wait... so the loser had to marry him!?",
            "About Dihua Marsh\tPaimon: Did you know the reeds in Dihua Marsh are common materials used in making paper?\nPaimon: The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes. It's all very sophisticated.\nPaimon: Over the years, many heroes and swordsmen have also chosen Dihua Marsh as the location of their duels.\nPaimon: The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep...\nPaimon: So there are a lot of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...\n{NICKNAME}: Huh. And what's my takeaway from all of this supposed to be?\nPaimon: Don't get into a fight in Dihua Marsh!",
            "About the Gentleman Bird\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that in Liyue, people call the crane the \"gentleman bird.\"\n{NICKNAME}: And do you know why that is?\nPaimon: Hmm... Paimon's not quite sure...\n{NICKNAME}: Well then, let me tell you about the story of the lucky crane repaying its debts.\n{NICKNAME}: A long, long time ago, there was a kind-hearted scholar who saved a lucky crane that had fallen into a trap.\n{NICKNAME}: Later, on a cold winter's night, a beautiful maiden came to his door, asking to lodge with him.\n{NICKNAME}: The maiden shouldered a greatsword on her back, and taught all that she knew of swordsmanship to the scholar, supervising him as he studied day and night.\nPaimon: Whoa...\n{NICKNAME}: Once he had finished his training, he went out into the wilds with the maiden to do good and fight for justice.\n{NICKNAME}: Ten years later, the lucky crane took the form of a gentleman, and finally came to return the favor, but discovered the couple had already lived out a fortuitous life...\n{NICKNAME}: And that's the story known as \"The Gentleman's 10-Year Debt.\"\nPaimon: Ahh...",
            "About Jueyun Karst\t{NICKNAME}: Rumor has it that Jueyun Karst is the abode of the adepti.\nPaimon: Wow — the abode of the adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps we'll meet the adepti on those cloud-piercing mountain peaks.\nPaimon: Wow — meeting adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: But I wonder... how would one normally communicate with the adepti?\nPaimon: Wow — communicating with adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm. My emergency rations seem to be going bad. *sigh* Best to consume them quickly...\nPaimon: Ahem. Well... Paimon thinks that shouting from the mountaintop should work.\n{NICKNAME}: That seems more like a way for getting the attention of a hilichurl instead of an adeptus.",
            "About the God of Contracts\t{NICKNAME}: To think that the Geo Archon had signed a contract with the Cryo Archon.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder what the contents of their agreement were...\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't care who you are, making a deal with the Tsaritsa is super dangerous!\n{NICKNAME}: Be that as it may...\n{NICKNAME}: Since Morax is the god who understands the basis of contracts the best...\n{NICKNAME}: He's definitely given this some thought.\nPaimon: Well that's true. Morax himself called it the \"contract to end all contracts\"...\n{NICKNAME}: I trust that we will witness the truth, and its denouement, play out...",
            "About Divine Predictions in Liyue\tPaimon: Come to think of it, while Rex Lapis enjoys visiting his people in private, he only descends officially once every year.\nPaimon: None of the other gods do this. Hmm... Does Rex Lapis have any deeper intentions?\n{NICKNAME}: I have my guesses...\n{NICKNAME}: You see, those annual divine predictions have already captured the hearts of the people of Liyue too much.\n{NICKNAME}: Round and around they analyze and scrutinize every single word, finding limitless \"hidden meanings\" within them...\n{NICKNAME}: What do you think would happen to Liyue if such divine predictions were available every day?\nPaimon: Ah!\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now. Paimon would be offering Rex Lapis' favorite snacks to him every day!\nPaimon: If you could just get Mora straight from Morax's hands, who would ever need to do a day of honest work?\n{NICKNAME}: You made... some logical leaps, but that's basically how it is.",
            "About Benny's Adventure Team\tPaimon: If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared.\nPaimon: Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double- and triple-check your supplies in advance.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of 463 different ways of dying in these domains...\nPaimon: If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Why am I the only one dying here?\nPaimon: Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid 322 causes of death just by floating!\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains...",
            "About Bennett\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that Albert, being the leader of Barbara's fan club...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Sometimes gets bumps and bruises on purpose so that he can go to the Cathedral to see her.\nPaimon: Paimon feels the Knights of Favonius should keep a closer watch on weirdos like that.\n{NICKNAME}: But it seems that a month later, Albert discovered that Bennett was managing to see Barbara far more than he was.\n{NICKNAME}: On second thought, Bennett does have the natural advantage when it comes to getting injured.\nPaimon: What is this, a \"let's bother Barbara\" contest?",
            "About the \"Idol\"\tPaimon: Barbara's really popular, isn't she?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, she is the idol of the people of Mondstadt.\nPaimon: Come to think of it... Paimon doesn't really know what an \"idol\" is.\n{NICKNAME}: It's an occupation in which one's work is to be cute, be well-loved, and earn a boat-load of Mora.\nPaimon: Isn't that the same thing as being a mascot?\n{NICKNAME}: That's... one way to put it.",
            "About Being Sisters\t{NICKNAME}: Lisa and Amber feel a bit like sisters.\nPaimon: Huh? Why's that?\n{NICKNAME}: Amber often runs errands for Lisa. Older siblings asking their younger siblings to do things for them so they can slack off is a rather common practice...\n{NICKNAME}: But, my brother and I are the same age, so we had to decide these things via rock-paper-scissors.\nPaimon. Whoa. So, doesn't that make you my younger sister?\n{NICKNAME}: What do you mean?\nPaimon: Well, since Paimon floats, you're the only one who can \"run\" any errands!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Seriously?",
            "About Kaeya's Eye Patch\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, have you ever seen what Kaeya looks like under that eye patch?\nPaimon: Nope.\n{NICKNAME}: So, it would seem that he never takes it off...\nPaimon: Actually, Paimon already knows why!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh?\nPaimon: He must be hiding some big secret!\n{NICKNAME}: Really, a secret?\nPaimon: See, Kaeya heads out for assignments more than anyone else.\nPaimon: So the skin under that eye patch has to be way lighter than the rest of him.\n{NICKNAME}: So if he ever takes that eye patch off...\nPaimon: He'll definitely become the butt of everyone's jokes. Maybe he'll even get a weird nickname!\nPaimon: Like, say, \"Pasty Eye\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Guess he didn't need to take it off to get a weird nickname...",
            "About Kaeya and Diluc\tPaimon: Strange...\n{NICKNAME}: What's wrong?\nPaimon: Diluc and Kaeya are really alike, so why don't they get along?\n{NICKNAME}: How are they alike, again?\nPaimon: Well, Kaeya's the kind of guy who acts shady in the light of day...\nPaimon: While Diluc is a shining beacon of justice in the dark of night!\nPaimon: Don't you think that's kinda the same thing...?\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I still don't see it.",
            "About Measuring Fighting Strength\t{NICKNAME}: If one hilichurl could beat, say, three wild boars...\n{NICKNAME}: Then how many hilichurls would it take to reach the fighting prowess of Master Jean and Master Diluc?\nPaimon: Not sure... but if you heard the way everyone talks in Mondstadt, you'd know that Master Jean is the strongest.\n{NICKNAME}: I'd say that if Diluc strikes first, Master Jean wouldn't be able to counter.\nPaimon: Oh, she'd find a way.\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way.\nPaimon: Master Jean's Elemental Burst is really strong, you know~\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that \"field\" would also make Diluc stronger.\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't think Master Jean would even need her Vision to take on Master Diluc, because—\n{NICKNAME}: Diluc would only need a beginner's greatsword to—\nPaimon: Argh...\n{NICKNAME}: Ugh...\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* This... is so dumb.\n{NICKNAME}: They both fight for Mondstadt, so they wouldn't come to blows.\nPaimon: That's why Paimon likes your idea of measuring their fighting strength in number of hilichurls.\nPaimon: ...Or in Paimon's case, in fifths of a wild boar.",
            "About Razor\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you know what a brush is, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Of course! Kinda like pens but with animal hair at one end for calligraphy, right?\nPaimon: That's correct! They say that finely-made brushes sell for high prices among Liyue's merchants!\n{NICKNAME}: So, would you like to make some too?\nPaimon: Uh-huh! But wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!\nPaimon: Razor's fur is all downy and soft. It'll definitely make great wolf-fur brushes! We could make lots of Mora like this!\n{NICKNAME}: Brushes made like that would conduct electricity. I'm not sure we could use them.\n{NICKNAME}: Besides, Razor isn't a wolf, nor are wolf brushes made from actual wolves' fur...\nPaimon: Huh? Why are they called wolf-fur brushes, then?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?\nPaimon: Hmm. You have a point.",
            "About Klee\tPaimon: Klee's a really interesting kid.\nPaimon: All the Knights seem to like her a lot, too. You could even say they spoil her.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder, who makes the better mascot: Paimon, or Klee?\n{NICKNAME}: Oh wait, I forgot. Paimon's not a mascot, Paimon is emergency—\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon knows exactly what you're going to say. That joke stopped being funny a long time ago.",
            "About the \"Wondermaid\"\tPaimon: It's time for Paimon's Little Life Tips!\n{NICKNAME}: \"Little Life Tips\"?\nPaimon: In Mondstadt, if there's something you can't fix, or there's something you can't get clean no matter what you do...\nPaimon: If you ever run into something you can't handle yourself, you just need to shout this name into the skies:\nPaimon: \"Noeeeelle!\"\nPaimon: And everything that's troubling you will be swept away in an instant.\n{NICKNAME}: So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt... Pretty impressive...",
            "About Fischl\tPaimon: Fischl makes a very unique impression, doesn't she?\n{NICKNAME}: How so?\nPaimon: Well, she travels together with a talking raven, for starters.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm traveling with you. It's not all that different.\n{NICKNAME}: Still, Oz can also translate for Fischl. You, on the other hand...\nPaimon: What!? Paimon's way better than some bird!\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, how so?\nPaimon: Well, um... uh... at least Paimon doesn't need wings to fly!",
            "About Pets\t{NICKNAME}: Speaking of Fischl, she also claims to be a \"visitor from another world\"...\n{NICKNAME}: We're similar in that way. We even bring a pet along with us.\nPaimon: Pet? Now, wait just a minute, here...\n{NICKNAME}: But her raven, Oz... He looks cool, and is polite to boot.\n{NICKNAME}: More importantly, he can both scout and fight — very useful indeed.\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe I should make arrangements with Fischl to trade companions once in a while for, say, a week or two at a time? Hehe, it should be quite interesting.\nPaimon: Hey! Doesn't Paimon get a say in this!?",
            "About Beidou\tPaimon: How do you become as popular and cool as Captain Beidou?\n{NICKNAME}: With enough experience...?\nPaimon: Paimon's already seen lots of things from adventuring together with you!\n{NICKNAME}: One also needs to experience trials and setbacks...\nPaimon: Paimon almost drowned that one time...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And maintain an inspirational disposition...\nPaimon: Uh-huh! Paimon's always rooted for you!\n{NICKNAME}: One must also have a... mature outlook towards problems.\nPaimon: Hey! Are you just trying to say that Paimon can't make it?",
            "About Ningguang\tPaimon: How does a person become as rich... no, as super rich as Lady Ningguang?\n{NICKNAME}: Hah... Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?\nPaimon: Well, there's the huge Jade Chamber, too! But isn't that also made of Mora?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you need an excellent mind...\nPaimon: Well... Paimon's really good at giving people nicknames!\n{NICKNAME}: You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets...\nPaimon: A serving of Fisherman's Toast goes for 1,025 Mora, and no discounts — even on rainy days.\n{NICKNAME}: You also need to be willing to work really hard...\nPaimon: Okay then... so, how do you make friends with a really rich person?\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, you're giving up already!?",
            "About Qiqi Being a Zombie\tPaimon: Umm... Do you think that Qiqi... needs to drink blood?\n{NICKNAME}: That's not a zombie, Paimon. That's a vampire.\nPaimon: Then, will she transform during a full moon?\n{NICKNAME}: Werewolves, Paimon. Not zombies.\nPaimon: Huh... As expected of a traveler, you really know a lot!\nPaimon: So, what special things can zombies do?\n{NICKNAME}: Exercises?\nPaimon: Ah, that makes a lot of sense! So, the ones that do exercises are zombies — got it!",

            "About Slimes\tPaimon: What sort of slime do you like the most, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Cryo Slimes, I think. You feel cold just getting close to them — you'll need that sort of thing in summer.\nPaimon: That's very practical, as expected of a traveler.\n{NICKNAME}: What about you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon likes them all! They're all very tasty!\n{NICKNAME}: Tasty, huh...\nPaimon: Turning slimes into bubbly, lovely, jubbly meals is the Paimon Special!\n{NICKNAME}: Well then...\n{NICKNAME}: I suppose that's one more thing I can eat before you become emergency rations, huh, Paimon?\nPaimon: Uhh... Paimon would rather not be on that list at all!",
            "About Hilichurls\t{NICKNAME}: Do you think that we're too harsh on the hilichurls?\nPaimon: Well... sometimes we really do seem like children who just can't resist kicking the hornet's nest...\n{NICKNAME}: I think we're doing more than just kicking it...",
            "About the Sleepers\t{NICKNAME}:  The \"Sleeper tribe\"... The hilichurls sure have interesting tribe names.\nPaimon: The Sleeper tribe will take any opportunity they can to take a nap.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that their animal-skin beds are really soft. Would you like to try them?\n{NICKNAME}: Not gonna try it yourself, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon can sleep while floating! The air is the softest bed. Pretty sweet, huh?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Just a little.",
            "About the Meaties\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Meaty tribe,\" huh? These hilichurls pick the funniest names.\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Meaty tribe make regular sacrifices. The altars they build are really huge.\n{NICKNAME}: What do they pray for?\nPaimon: \"For meat to eat every day\"! It's an awesome wish, isn't it?\n{NICKNAME}: ...I suppose I should have expected that answer.",
            "About the Eclipse Tribe\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Eclipse tribe\"... Huh. So the hilichurls have normal-sounding tribe names like these, too.\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Eclipse tribe are really mysterious.\nPaimon: All the hilichurls of that tribe can draw an eclipse symbol.\nPaimon: But rumor has it that only the Dada Samachurl of the Eclipse tribe knows why the eclipse symbol is so revered within their tribe.\n{NICKNAME}: An eclipse symbol...\nPaimon: Hmm? Did you say something, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Ah... I was... asking you what sort of soup you'd like to have tonight.\nPaimon: Can't stop thinking about food, huh? Seems like you'd be more at home in the Meaty tribe than the Eclipse tribe. But anyway, Paimon wants boar soup. Thanks!",
            "About Riches\tPaimon: Paimon doesn't feel so good...\n{NICKNAME}: What's the matter?\nPaimon: Paimon hasn't opened a treasure chest in so long.

Won't you be unable to fly if you get fat?\nPaimon: Nope! Paimon never gets fat!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh...\nPaimon: So Paimon demands more food!\n{NICKNAME}: Ever eating but never growing... Don't you fail as emergency rations, then?\nPaimon: Yeah, yeah... Well it sure doesn't look like you have any other candidates... So you'll have to make do with Paimon!",

And what did the ocean say?\nPaimon: The ocean said... that it's time to eat, so let's go! Paimon wants some Fisherman's Toast!",

Sleeping?\nPaimon: Sleeping's boring.\n{NICKNAME}: Reading?\nPaimon: Paimon'll get dizzy.\n{NICKNAME}: ...Okay, having a chat with some friends?\nPaimon: ...Ugh.\nPaimon: But those're all things that require thinking.\nPaimon: And not thinking is more relaxing.\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* And thus the \"Paimon Paradox,\" famed in the histories of philosophy in Teyvat, was put forth...",
            "About Dietary Differences\t{NICKNAME}: Liyue's cuisine is very different from that of Mondstadt.\n{NICKNAME}: For example, in Mondstadt you can hardly find spicy fried dishes anywhere.\nPaimon: That's why they say \"climate creates cuisine,\" ya know?\nPaimon: But wait... Why do all of Teyvat's slimes taste the same, then?\n{NICKNAME}: That's because you only know one way of cooking them...",
            "About Saving Money\tPaimon: Wow, a weasel thief's backpack can really hide a lot of Mora!\n{NICKNAME}: Well, it's because weasels, by nature, enjoy collecting shiny objects.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the origin of the weasel thieves has something to do with the Treasure Hoarders...\nPaimon: Also, aren't crows the type to collect shinies as well?\nPaimon: Paimon wonders if Oz has a secret stash of Mora that he collects behind Fischl's back.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, now that you mention it, Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder, do you have—\nPaimon: —Uhh... Nope. Nothing here! You won't find any Mora in Paimon's shoes, no way!",
            "About Adventure Stories\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, have you ever read \"Vera's Melancholy\" before?\nPaimon: Well, it sure sounds familiar!\n{NICKNAME}: That book's pretty popular, and I've heard that the author made a tidy sum off of it...\nPaimon: *sigh* Paimon would love to make lots and lots of Mora...\nPaimon: Hmm... It's decided, then! Paimon will write an adventure story as well!\n{NICKNAME}: A tale of adventure, by Paimon?\nPaimon: Correct! It'll be a story in which the brave traveler defeats the dragon, saves the world...\nPaimon: And then sits down with her reliable companion for ten servings of Sticky Honey Roast!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Ten!?\nPaimon: Uh-huh! A happy ending attracts the readers, after all!\nPaimon: It's decided, then! We'll call it \"Paimon's Happiness!\"\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, what?",
            "About Nightmares\tPaimon: Have you ever had one of those super scary nightmares, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Um, I've dreamt of falling through endless darkness...\n{NICKNAME}: Without a wind glider.\nPaimon: Eek...\n{NICKNAME}: I've also dreamt of my brother walking away from me, while I'm unable to catch up to him no matter how fast I run.\n{NICKNAME}: ...He tells me that I've \"come too late.\"\nPaimon: Oh...\nPaimon: Yours are quite different from the ones that Paimon's had.\nPaimon: Paimon's scariest dream was being eaten by a super giant slime.",
            "About Seelie\t{NICKNAME}: I wonder where those treasure-chasing Seelie come from.\nPaimon: Maybe they grow out of the ground — or maybe they fall from trees?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon doesn't know where they come from, but where there are Seelie, treasure's not far away!\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* Still... why do I feel a certain sadness every time they touch those treasures?\nPaimon: Hmm?\n{NICKNAME}: ...No, it's probably just my imagination.\nPaimon: Well... if you don't want the treasure, Paimon can hang onto it for you, free of charge!",
            "About Someone Unforgettable\tPaimon: Has anyone left a big impression on you during our recent travels?\nPaimon: For Paimon, that's Sara.\n{NICKNAME}: Timmie.\nPaimon: ...Huh? Why him?\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* His face comes to mind every time I've eaten a Sweet Madame recently... Really makes it hard to chow down.",
            "About Language\tPaimon: You learn new things so quickly.\nPaimon: You've already got such a good grasp of Teyvat's language.\n{NICKNAME}: You're a good teacher, Paimon.\nPaimon: Aww, hehehe...\n{NICKNAME}: Who knows, maybe the quality of your nasty nicknames will improve someday.",
            "About Paimon's Species\t{NICKNAME}: What monster made the deepest impression on you?\nPaimon: Monsters, huh? Probably... Ruin Guards.\n{NICKNAME}: Does a Ruin Guard really count as a monster? It's more like a machine...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that you can call anything that causes us trouble and needs to be defeated a \"monster.\"\nPaimon: Just like how we call anything that can be hunted \"prey.\"\n{NICKNAME}: Is that so... Well then, I think I'm finally able to classify you now, Paimon.\nPaimon: Eh? What do you mean?\n{NICKNAME}: You can be hooked and reeled in... therefore, you're a fish!\nPaimon: Hmph!",
            "About Storing Weapons\tPaimon: Hey, do that again! You know, that thing!\n{NICKNAME}: Which one?\nPaimon: The one where you make your weapon disappear with a swish, and then, fwoosh — you make it appear behind your back again!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, that. Haven't you seen that a ton already?\nPaimon: But Paimon hasn't figured out how you do it yet. Could you explain it?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, can you explain how you suddenly appear in front of me, and then disappear just as suddenly?\nPaimon: Uh... well... Paimon seems to have always been able to do this. But Paimon doesn't know how...\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. I believe that the art of putting my weapon away follows the same principle.\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe it's this similarity that makes us such good friends.",
            "About Chests\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, what do you think of treasure chests?\n{NICKNAME}: I believe that they were left behind by great travelers who once passed this way.\n{NICKNAME}: Every time I open one and look at its contents, I can feel a certain kinship with those who came before...\nPaimon: And that's how you get adventure experience!",
            "About Eyes\tPaimon: Look into Paimon's eyes!\n{NICKNAME}: Something the matter?\nPaimon: Kaeya said that people's eyes will betray them.\nPaimon: He can tell if someone is telling the truth or not just by looking into their eyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Huh...\nPaimon: Paimon loves Fisherman's Toast!\n{NICKNAME}: That should be the truth. Haha, well, that's also because you love everything that can be eaten.\nPaimon: Hehe.\n{NICKNAME}: Speaking of looking into people's eyes... I remember one gaze that left a particularly deep impression on me.\nPaimon: Whose gaze was that?\n{NICKNAME}: A Ruin Guard's. Really made me want to poke its eye out...",
            "About Imitating Others\tPaimon: Ugh, Paimon's so bored... So tired...\n{NICKNAME}: Well, since we're bored either way, wanna imitate the other Knights for fun?\nPaimon: Huh? Isn't that a bit disrespectful?\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, I see you already have the knightly virtue of modesty and politeness. Very impressive.\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon sees what you're doing. Cut it out!",
            "About the Luck of the Draw\tPaimon: Urrrrgh...\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? Are there pigeons around?\nPaimon: No, Paimon's just hungry.\nPaimon: What Paimon needs right now is a traveler who can whip up some delicious Sticky Honey Roast.\nPaimon: So, who's going to be the lucky traveler? Hmm?",

            "About the Vision Hunt Decree\tPaimon: It's hard to talk about the recent events in Inazuma and not mention the Vision Hunt Decree.\nPaimon: But you don't have a Vision, so you don't have to worry about losing one.\nPaimon: On the flip side, if you are caught by the Tenryou Commission, {NICKNAME}, you also can't surrender your Vision in exchange for your life...\n{NICKNAME}: I can tell them that you are my Vision.\nPaimon: Another reason to have Paimon around... Wait, WHAT!?\n{NICKNAME}: Don't worry, I wouldn't let them take you, Paimon.\nPaimon: That's more like it.\n{NICKNAME}: We'd just go to jail and suffer punishment together...\nPaimon: Uh... W—Well, if that's how it would go down, then maybe you should hand me over to them...\nPaimon: ...Wait a minute! How about we just don't get caught in the first place?",
            "About the Resistance\tPaimon: Only the ones who have the will to fight back are allowed into the Resistance!\nPaimon: Huh. In that case, Paimon also qualifies as a member.\n{NICKNAME}: And what exactly are you trying to resist, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon has been resisting against the fate of being squished all this time!\n{NICKNAME}: Then you probably won't get in.\nPaimon: Why? Is it because Paimon isn't fighting for the same cause as the Resistance?\n{NICKNAME}: It's because you're fighting for a lost cause, I'm afraid...\nPaimon: *sob* Y—You meanie!",
            "About Kamuijima Cannons\tPaimon: Kamuileon... Cannon? Kamuijuicy... Cannon? Kamuijimmy... Cannon? Ugh... What a mouthful.\n{NICKNAME}: What are you reading, Paimon?\nPaimon: Look, it's the super weapon the Shogunate army has constructed nearby to protect Tatarasuna.\nPaimon:  Kamuijima! Cannon!\n{NICKNAME}: It looks really powerful... And yet, we didn't see it do anything while we were in Tatarasuna.\nPaimon: It seems like the Resistance knew how strong it was, so before formally waging war against the Shogunate, they had covertly occupied this place.\nPaimon: But this Kamui... Kamuijima Cannon needs either special ammunition or Electro to work, so it's no use to the Resistance.\nPaimon: The Shogunate army put so much time and effort into creating this weapon... Paimon really wants to see the extent of its power.\n{NICKNAME}: If all you need is an Electro user, perhaps I can help.\nPaimon: That's right! Now we just need something that would serve as our cannon ball...\nPaimon: Huh? ...Why are you giving me that look? Hey—",
            "About Taroumaru\tPaimon: You know what? When we first arrived at the Komore Teahouse, Paimon really thought that Taroumaru would be able to speak...\n{NICKNAME}: You sound a bit disappointed.\nPaimon: Of course! If Taroumaru could speak, Paimon feels that he'd say something really interesting!\n{NICKNAME}: For example?\nPaimon: Hmm... \"Thoma, stop hiding around here, you're in my way! *woof*\"\n{NICKNAME}: That makes sense.\nPaimon: Or... \"Kozue, you're bound to me for the rest of your life, unless our contract is terminated! *woof* *woof*\"\n{NICKNAME}: You didn't believe Kozue when she said she'd signed a secret contract forcing her to work part-time at the Teahouse, did you?\nPaimon: Oh! Paimon just thought of another one. This one's quite good—\nPaimon: \"Just look at this visitor! Paimon, is it? Look at how cute and clever she is. Today, all her meals are on the house! *woof*\"\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way Taroumaru would say something like that.\nPaimon: Hee-hee...",
            "About Gorou\tPaimon: Hmm...\n{NICKNAME}: What are you mulling over, Paimon?\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, do you remember Gorou's fluffy ears?\nPaimon: Paimon really wants something like that... Or maybe horns similar to the ones Ganyu has. Ganyu's horns are pretty cute as well.\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, do you have any ideas?\n{NICKNAME}: Let me see, hmm... Oh, I found something!\nPaimon: Really? Aw, {NICKNAME}, Paimon always knew you were reliable!\n{NICKNAME}: Ta-da! I present to you the Tusk of Monoceros Caeli!\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't need that!\nPaimon: *sigh* If Paimon can't have Gorou's fluffy ears, then maybe at least something like his fluffy tail...\n{NICKNAME}: Bubadada! Here you go — Tail of Boreas!\nPaimon: ...Not that! Also, combining those two is definitely not the look Paimon is going for!",
            "About Publishing Novels\tPaimon: It's amazing that Inazuma has places like the Yae Publishing House which specializes in publishing novels!\nPaimon: They even host competitions! Wow!\n{NICKNAME}: If that's the case, then perhaps you can submit a draft of the book you've been working on, \"Paimon's Happiness.\"\nPaimon: Well, about that... Paimon has misplaced the drafts on our way to Inazuma...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Really?\nPaimon: Fine! Paimon hasn't started writing it yet...\nPaimon: It's not Paimon's fault! Paimon's been meaning to do it but three days ago, Paimon's pen broke. The day before yesterday, Paimon had hand cramps. Yesterday — a sprained foot. Today... Paimon... Hmmm... Paimon's hungry!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, it sounds like you'll sooner write \"A Thousand Excuses with Paimon\" than \"Paimon's Happiness.\"",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tPaimon: Kazuha is a free spirit, wouldn't you say?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, he seems to be a bit of a loner too.\nPaimon: Being able to explore the world at his leisure while savoring the beauty of everything around him. That doesn't sound too shabby...\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you aren't thinking of sneaking off to go on a solo adventure, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Aw, I would never leave you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Paimon's really happy to hear that. Here... Hee—hee, have this...\n{NICKNAME}: Monthly food expenses... 300,000 Mora!?\nPaimon: Hey! Wait! {NICKNAME}, Where are you going?\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly feel like going solo. Maybe it's not a bad idea after all.\nPaimon: Please don't go! Wait for Paimon!",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tPaimon: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon, you look so serious today.\nPaimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.\nPaimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families. They have an endless supply of Mora and mountains of delicious food to eat...\n{NICKNAME}: I can't disagree. Those are exactly the things you're fond of.\nPaimon: But after getting to know Ayaka better, Paimon realized that a young lady from a noble family can also have her share of hardships.\nPaimon: She needs to shoulder her clan's duties and responsibilities. She works so hard and has very little time for herself.\nPaimon: Ayaka must be exhausted, she should try to relax a bit...\nPaimon: Ah, that's right! Let's invite Ayaka to the next festival!\nPaimon: If she got an invite from us, there's no way she'd refuse.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, I'd like to go to another festival with her.\nPaimon: Besides, if Ayaka's around, she can pick up the tab for us...\n{NICKNAME}: ...I should've seen that coming...",
            "About Imitating Ayaka\tPaimon: Ayaka gives a sense of noble elegance with every gesture she makes.\n{NICKNAME}: Can you do an Ayaka impression, Paimon?\nPaimon: Let's give it a try.\nPaimon: \"Oh my, you've been picking mushrooms so earnestly just to make Chicken-Mushroom Skewers for me?\"\nPaimon: \"How cute...\"\n{NICKNAME}: That was nothing like Ayaka. But...\n{NICKNAME}: Even though you didn't sound like yourself, it didn't feel completely out of place for you either...",
            "About Festival Traditions\tPaimon: It's a well-established tradition that during Inazuman celebrations everyone's wearing festive masks.\nPaimon: Paimon tried to look around the stalls, but hasn't found any mask that fits...\n{NICKNAME}: So you really want a mask of your own?\nPaimon: Of course! Not wearing a mask during an Inazuman festival is the same as not receiving a bouquet at the Windblume Festival...\n{NICKNAME}: Let me make one for you.\nPaimon: Whoa! {NICKNAME}, you're the best!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm, I wonder what kind of mask will fit you best? How about... a slime mask?\nPaimon: Yay, Paimon Slime!",
            "About Yoimiya\tPaimon: Do you think Yoimiya's dad's poor hearing is related to fireworks?\nPaimon: He's been making and testing fireworks for many years now, and being exposed to the sound of gunpowder explosions on a daily basis... Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...\nPaimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?\nPaimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?\nPaimon: Uh... Um...\nPaimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...\n{NICKNAME}: Then you'd need to leave me.\nPaimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!\nPaimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...\n{NICKNAME}: Actually, she can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind, but I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.\nPaimon: Eh? So you knew this whole time, but didn't tell Paimon?\nPaimon: How could you! You bully!",
            "About Sayu's Troubles\tPaimon: Sayu seems to have a lot on her mind.\nPaimon: Paimon can't understand why she'd have so many worries.\n{NICKNAME}: I guess this is what they call growing pains.\nPaimon: Hmm, Paimon can't relate to that.\nPaimon: After all, it's not Paimonly to worry too much.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Bad news! We're almost out of Mora. I guess we'll have to tighten the purse strings for the next few days...\nPaimon: Wh-What? Noooo!\n{NICKNAME}: See, you're not as carefree as you thought.\nPaimon: Ooh... How could you prank Paimon like that...",
            "About Onikabuto\tPaimon: Those Onikabuto bugs look so scary! The patterns on their backs are terrifying!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you mean those demonic patterns? It's because they don't like to fight, so they purposely evolved their patterns in a way that scares their enemies away.\nPaimon: That's really smart. We should try to learn a thing or two from them!\nPaimon: We could borrow Xiao's mask. If a hilichurl saw you wearing it, do you think they'd run in fear?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I don't think Xiao would agree to that...\nPaimon: Yeah... Hmm, how about we ask Sayu to steal his mask for us?\nPaimon: She knows ninjutsu that allows her to vanish into thin air. She can steal it for sure! Problem solved!\nPaimon: Uh... If we are afraid of Xiao evening the score with us, how about we steal Childe's mask? We've kicked his butt many times before!\n{NICKNAME}: I don't think stealing other people's belongings is a good idea. Also, what if Sayu doesn't agree to all of this?\nPaimon: Th—Then let's... Let's visit Albedo first.\nPaimon: If Albedo can develop a growth serum for Sayu, she'll help us for sure!\n{NICKNAME}: Brilliant, now we just need you to come up with a way to make Albedo help us.\nPaimon: Ugh! Paimon's head is going to explode. Let's stick to festival masks for now.",
            "About Naku Weed\tPaimon: Even though Naku Weed has a flower-like structure, its \"petals\" are in fact leaves.\nPaimon: Its actual bloom is rather fragile, so the surrounding leaves try their hardest to grow strong and protect it...\nPaimon: Hee-hee, just like Paimon is protecting you right now.\n{NICKNAME}: Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?\nPaimon: Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?",
            "About Naku Weed and Storms\tPaimon: Did you know? The people in Inazuma use the vibrations of Naku Weed to forecast thunderstorms.\nPaimon: Because Naku Weed grows in areas that are infused with Electro, it's naturally drawn to thunder and lightning.\n{NICKNAME}: Does that mean Naku Weed is similar to you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Eh? How so?\n{NICKNAME}: You know, because you usually hang out in areas infused with gourmet food and are naturally drawn to tasty snacks!\nPaimon: Hee-hee, that's true!\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon radar activated...\nPaimon: *beep* Delicacies, here we go!",
            "About Sakura Blooms\tPaimon: The blossoms drifting down from the Sacred Sakura are so dazzling!\nPaimon: Paimon heard that those flower petals can stay suspended in the air for so long because of being infused with Electro.\n{NICKNAME}: Is it the same principle behind your levitation abilities?\nPaimon: Uh... Ah... That's because...\n{NICKNAME}: You do know what allows you to fly, don't you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon can fly because of... mysterious powers, obviously!\n{NICKNAME}: Got it. Seems like you have no idea.\n{NICKNAME}: How about we let Albedo do some research? He's good at cracking such mysteries...\nPaimon: Please don't!",
            "About Lavender Melons\tPaimon: Lavender Melons sure are useful!\nPaimon: Their flesh can be eaten, and their skin can be processed to make dyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon sure is useful!\n{NICKNAME}: She can serve as my guide, and she can also give other people ugly nicknames, haha.\nPaimon: Yep! Thank you for your validation!\nPaimon: Wait a minute, is there more? Is Paimon about to get roasted?\nPaimon: Paimon's gonna cover your mouth to stop you from talking!",
            "About Swords\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, have you noticed?\nPaimon: In Inazuma, people who wear swords on their waists are a minority. Most soldiers use spears.\nPaimon: Could it be that swords are a symbol of status... Should we wear them as well?\nPaimon: But the swords here are all too big for Paimon... There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!\n{NICKNAME}: A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.\nPaimon: Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Really? Really? Let's have a look!\nPaimon: Hey! Isn't that the knife we use to cut fruit?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, at least it's the right size for you...\n{NICKNAME}: Ahem, \"What matters isn't the value of the sword, it's the fighting spirit.\"\nPaimon: Nice try, but Paimon won't fall for this, no matter how cool it sounds!",
            "About Hot Springs\tPaimon: Did you know there are hot springs in Inazuma?\n{NICKNAME}: ...But there are no volcanoes.\nPaimon: Umm, Paimon heard that the heat comes from a giant furnace!\nPaimon: If we get the chance, Paimon also wants to check out a hot spring. Unfortunately, it seems like only the big shots are granted entry.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Let's head back to the Dadaupa Gorge in Mondstadt!\nPaimon: Eh? Why so sudden?\n{NICKNAME}: Back in the Dadaupa Gorge, the hilichurls have a huge cauldron that's heated by Flaming Flowers. It should be similar to a hot spring, right? You can bathe in their... soup, I guess?\nPaimon: ???",
            "About Jugemu\tPaimon: In Inazuma, it's customary for parents to choose a lucky name for their child.\n{NICKNAME}: Those names symbolize everyone's expectations and wishes for the child, like prosperity, wealth, good health, and safety.\nPaimon: Because of these expectations, parents often pick extra long names, and cram all sorts of blessings into them.\n{NICKNAME}: So hypothetically, if one day a little girl fell into a lake on her way back home, then her friends might rush to her house to tell everyone, \"Something bad happened!\"\nPaimon: \"Oh, what happened?\"\n{NICKNAME}: Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, Prinzessin der Verurteilung Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, come quick! Centennial Genius Astrologist Mona Megistus has fallen into the water!\nPaimon: ...Mona falling into the water doesn't sound like an emergency situation though.\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. The fast-swimming Mona would come back home around the same time her friends are done saying her name, haha.",
            "About Inazuma's Islands\tPaimon: Inazuma's scenery is quite different than what we've seen so far.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, Inazuma's an island nation.\nPaimon: Before the invention of boats, how did the people living on different islands communicate with one another?\n{NICKNAME}: According to Yoimiya's dad, they probably used smoke signals to transmit information.\n{NICKNAME}: Or, they would...\nPaimon: Yeah...?\n{NICKNAME}: They would commission people who could freeze the water surface to travel between the islands and deliver messages.\nPaimon: Whoa! If Kaeya had lived in Inazuma back then, he would've been even busier than Master Jean now!",
            "About Tanuki\tPaimon: Tanuki are really mysterious creatures.\n{NICKNAME}: I think they are really cute.\nPaimon: Yeah, they're cute... until they start talking.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, I wonder... If you couldn't talk, would you appear to be more mysterious and noble?\nPaimon: Are you trying to mock me?\n{NICKNAME}: *randomly humming innocently*",
            "About Tanuki and Their Illusions\tPaimon: Did anyone tell you that there are monsters called tanuki in Inazuma that can take on the form of any human they see?\n{NICKNAME}: I heard such rumors before. They must know some mysterious transformation techniques.\nPaimon: What if one day a tanuki tricked you by transforming into Paimon? Oh no... Paimon's worried now! \n{NICKNAME}: No worries, I'd surely be able to tell the difference— Wait! You're just concerned about my Mora, aren't you?\nPaimon: Of course... Ah! ...No, no! Paimon's only concerned about your safety, {NICKNAME}!\nPaimon: Hmph, stop looking at Paimon like that. *pouting* Look, just think about it! If there were two Paimons, how would you find out which one is the real one?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Eh-he.\nPaimon: What do you mean \"eh-he\"!?\n{NICKNAME}: See, only the real Paimon would respond like that.\nPaimon: Ah! Paimon got tricked again...",
            "About Other Shrines\tPaimon: We've been passing by a lot of small shrines lately, but none of them seem to be dedicated to the Electro Archon.\n{NICKNAME}: They were probably built for lesser deities. The people of Inazuma believe that everything around them has a spirit, and those spirits will help them in their time of need.\nPaimon: Oh, so the people make shrines for them, and give them offerings.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. In a way, it's a form of prayer and a token of appreciation.\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now! Let's find Ayaka, and have her put up a shrine for us!\nPaimon: If we do that, we'll be able to get lots of offerings as well!\nPaimon: Paimon's so happy!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I—Is that an acceptable thing to do?\nPaimon: What's wrong? Haven't we been helping out everyone this whole time? We may be doing an even better job than those deities!\n{NICKNAME}: You do have a point...\n{NICKNAME}: But when I picture people placing flowers or fruits in front of a shrine for me... it doesn't feel right.",
            "About the Rain on Yashiori Island\t{NICKNAME}: It never stops raining on Yashiori Island. I heard it's because of the lingering evil energy.\nPaimon: \"Evil energy\"? What's that? Sounds terrifying.\n{NICKNAME}: It's caused by the remains of an evil god somewhere on the island. Because its power hasn't fully dispersed, the remaining energy causes all sorts of misfortunes. That's what I meant when I said \"evil energy.\"\nPaimon: Oh, that makes sense. But Paimon doesn't think rain is a bad thing.\nPaimon: Maybe that god has been crying all this time because they were bullied.\n{NICKNAME}: Crying? I don't think gods can cry. I mean, I've never seen Venti or Zhongli cry before.\nPaimon: There are exceptions! If you pinch Paimon, you'll be able to see a crying god.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? Are you a god?\nPaimon: Paimon sure is!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, let me guess... The flying god of silly questions? The god of slimes? Or the god of being fished out from the water?\nPaimon: Paimon's none of those! Hmph!\nPaimon: As your bodyguard, {NICKNAME}, Paimon is the god of protection! Hehe.",
            "About Bantan Sango Detective Agency\t{NICKNAME}: In Hanamizaka, there's a place called the Bantan Sango Detective Agency.\nPaimon: Paimon remembers. It's the one run by Sango and Ryuuji, right? Everyone speaks highly of them.\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, I heard that they frequently get caught up in strange incidents, and some places have banned them from entering their premises...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that's undeserved. After all, Sango and Ryuuji have helped a lot of people...\n{NICKNAME}: Would you invite them if you were organizing a dinner party?\n{NICKNAME}: What if halfway through the meal, one of the guests suddenly shrieked and collapsed onto the ground...\nPaimon: I—If that's the case, then Paimon thinks it's a bad idea. Paimon suddenly feels that hanging out with them could be dangerous...\n{NICKNAME}: Well, that's the price you pay for being a famous detective.",
            "About Drawing Fortune Slips\tPaimon: Oh yeah, have you drawn fortune slips at the shrine before, {NICKNAME}?\nPaimon: If we draw them before our next adventure, they may provide us with some guidance.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, but what if our draws are inauspicious or turn out to be a bad omen? If that happened, we'd probably end up in a bad mood...\nPaimon: Oh, that's fine. According to the shrine maidens, if someone draws a bad omen, they just need to hang it on a tree in the shrine...\nPaimon: So, we should keep on drawing and drawing, until we get a super lucky draw! Then, we'll hang all the bad ones on the tree!\n{NICKNAME}: If everyone did that, there'd be no more space left to hang the slips...",
            "About Musou no Hitotachi\tPaimon: Musou no Hitotachi is amazing!\nPaimon: It can beat any enemy with a single slash!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, but for Childe, it might need three slashes...\nPaimon: Y—Yeah!\nPaimon: Anyway, if you mastered that technique, Paimon wouldn't have to worry about you for the rest of our journey!\n{NICKNAME}: So, where can one learn that technique?\nPaimon: Yeah, where can one learn that technique?\n{NICKNAME}: Hm?\nPaimon: Quit looking at Paimon like that! O—Okay, Paimon will keep an eye on you during our adventures...",
            "About Sangonomiya Kokomi\tPaimon: Did you know, {NICKNAME}? That Sangonomiya Kokomi, she's Watatsumi Island's Divine Priestess.\nPaimon: In other words, she's the ruler of Watatsumi Island! The whole of Watatsumi Island is controlled by her.\nPaimon: Paimon also wants to become a big shot like her...\n{NICKNAME}: What will you do after you become a big shot?\nPaimon: Then, Paimon will deliver justice. For example... Ahem.\nPaimon: The suspect in question, known as the Traveler, ate two Dango for lunch and only gave one to the victim, Paimon. This is a serious violation of article thirty seven, \"Fairness and Justice,\" of the \"Paimon Decree.\"\n{NICKNAME}: Oh... may I ask how Your Excellency Paimon plans to resolve this issue?\nPaimon: Of course. As compensation for your wrongdoings, you will have to make even more Dango for Paimon, hee-hee!",
            "About Transience\tPaimon: Paimon wonders what the previous Shogun was like.\n{NICKNAME}: It appears that she was a person who understood the fleeting nature of things, and accepted the inevitable fate of departing this world one day.\nPaimon: After all, realizing the fragility of things in front of you makes you treasure them even more.\n{NICKNAME}: This way of thinking must've influenced Inazuma's aesthetics. This world is transient, people come and go. The fun times we shared, our companionship, and the delicious foods we got to savor — those emotions and experiences are real things that existed at some point in time, not just empty concepts.\nPaimon: Even though... Even though every banquet must eventually come to an end, it'd be nice to enjoy those happy moments for a little longer.\n{NICKNAME}: \"Shifting seasons and elusive dreams, the ephemeral and fleeting, with thine companionship, all are eternal.\"\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't get it!\n{NICKNAME}: I'm saying that I'm having a lot of fun traveling with you, Paimon. It'd be nice if we could just go on like this forever.\nPaimon: Paimon'll take your word for it then.",
            "About Shrine Maidens\tPaimon: The clothes that shrine maidens wear are quite unique.\n{NICKNAME}: I heard that after the Sakoku Decree is lifted, Yae Miko plans to run a rental service where people can try on shrine maiden outfits as a tourist attraction in various places. Combined with the latest Kamera technology from Fontaine, it seems like a real Mora maker.\nPaimon: Oh!\n{NICKNAME}: {MThe shrine maidens in the Grand Shrine even asked me if I knew any pretty girls who are willing to become models. All they need to do is to dress up in a shrine maiden outfit and smile to the Kamera. They even asked me to be a model and said all I needed was some makeup.}{FThe shrine maidens in the Grand Shrine even asked me if I was interested in becoming a model! All I need to do is wear a shrine maiden outfit and smile to the Kamera. They also asked me if I knew any other cute girls.}\nPaimon: What!?\n{NICKNAME}: I immediately shared this idea with Rosaria. I feel like they can do something similar at the Church of Favonius with the garments they wear.\nPaimon: Wait, Paimon doesn't think that a...\n{NICKNAME}: Sadly, Rosaria found the idea of it too troublesome.\nPaimon: Maybe it's for the better...",
            "About the Artist Utamarou\tPaimon: Aoi gave Paimon a painting. Turns out it's not edible, but Paimon is still very happy with that gift!\n{NICKNAME}: Aoi? The general goods shop owner? Let me see.\nPaimon: Here, but be careful. It was painted by a famous artist, Utamarou. It's quite valuable!\n{NICKNAME}: Utamarou? Hmm... I think I've heard that name before...\nPaimon: Of course, master Utamarou's works can be found all around Inazuma after all!\nPaimon: Did you see one of them in Ayaka's residence? The one that Paimon has right now isn't too shabby either.\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, I remember now! One of those paintings was used by Yoimiya as kindling, right?\nPaimon: Eh? Kindling?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, yeah! I think Thoma used it as padding for table legs as well.\nPaimon: What? Padding?\n{NICKNAME}: And, if I remember correctly, I also saw Sayu use a stack of those paintings as a cushion for her nap.\nPaimon: Sayu has several of those works? That can't be right...\n{NICKNAME}: Real masterpieces aren't mass-produced. If you ask me, that Utamarou isn't a real master at all.\nPaimon: Hey—",
            "About the Teahouse and Its Owner\tPaimon: The Komore Teahouse is doing surprisingly well. They have a great number of visitors every day.\nPaimon: We should also open a teahouse. Paimon feels that it'd be really profitable!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Well, if we do end up opening a teahouse, then you're gonna be the boss, for sure.\nPaimon: Eh? Deal!\nPaimon: Paimon didn't think that you'd have so much faith in Paimon's abilities... Paimon will make sure to be a responsible manager, and make our shop the best teahouse in Teyvat!\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh, I don't think it'd need to be managed... Do you remember Taroumaru?\nPaimon: Yup, he's the owner of the Komore Teahouse, right? A lot of the clients go to the Teahouse to play with him rather than drink tea.\n{NICKNAME}: So I was thinking, if you were running the shop, you'd definitely be more popular than Taroumaru.\nPaimon: Hee-hee, of course... Hey! So you don't really trust Paimon's management skills, you just want a mascot!?",
            "About the Sakoku Decree\t{NICKNAME}: With the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, I guess the Sakoku Decree will be the next one to go.\nPaimon: Here's hoping that everything goes well.\n{NICKNAME}: Let's encourage everyone to hold on for just a bit longer.\nPaimon: Yeah!\n{NICKNAME}: If we get the chance, let's find Atsuko and tell her that the sakura trees in her homeland are blooming.\nPaimon: How is that supposed to comfort her!?",
            "About Kimonos\tPaimon: *sigh* Ogura Mio says that she hardly has any fancy kimonos in stock these days. So, chances are that you won't be able to buy one, even if you can afford it.\nPaimon: It's a real tragedy... Paimon wants to look glamorous, too.\n{NICKNAME}: But the Sakoku Decree's been abolished... She should be able to import silk from Liyue now.\nPaimon: *gasp* You're right! Great, so there's hope for Paimon's kimono-dream after all!\nPaimon: Just imagine it... Paimon emerges from Ogura's shop wearing a custom-made pure-silk one-of-a-kind kimono. Total transformation! This Paimon's going places!\nPaimon: No longer just a sidekick in the legendary Traveler's adventure story... Oh no, say hello to Paimon the Elegant, wearer of fine silks and fated friend of heroes!\nPaimon: Ahhh... Wouldn't that be amazing?\nPaimon: ...It would, wouldn't it, {NICKNAME}? Um, so—\n{NICKNAME}: What I'm hearing is... you want me to pay for your new wardrobe.\nPaimon: Exactly, you read Paimon's mind! See, that's what being \"fated friends\" is all about!\nPaimon: Um, so Paimon was thinking seven different styles, one for each day of the week. Still not sure on the specific designs though, let Paimon think...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Uh, suddenly, I'm not so interested in buying.",
            "About Canned Knowledge\tPaimon: Free knowledge without having to study at all? Canned Knowledge is amazing!\nPaimon: Could Sumeru have Canned Knowledge about the different customs of the seven nations, too?\nPaimon: If so, Paimon could just open a can every time we get to a new place. Paimon wouldn't have to explain things ever again!\n{NICKNAME}: Or we could just open them all here in Sumeru.\nPaimon: But... but traveling wouldn't be any fun without surprises to look forward to!\n{NICKNAME}: Plus, if we opened them all here, I wouldn't even need Paimon as a guide anymore.\nPaimon: Okay scrap that idea! No more Canned Knowledge. Let's save our Mora for something else!\nPaimon: Something like... Oh! tipping Paimon for guide services! Heehee, seems fair, right?",
            "About The Eremites\tPaimon: The Eremites are a real motley crew...\n{NICKNAME}: There's certainly a diverse range of characters.\nPaimon: Hmmm... yeah, that could explain it! Paimon can play lots of different characters too.\nPaimon: Judgy Paimon, knowledgeable Paimon, helpful Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And of course the classic, completely-misses-the-point Paimon.",
            "About Beliefs\tPaimon: Have you noticed something? People in Sumeru don't seem to have a lot of faith in Lesser Lord Kusanali.\nPaimon: Back in Liyue and Inazuma, people were pretty enthusiastic about Rex Lapis and the Almighty Shogun.\nPaimon: Those strange scholars are one thing, but even everyone living downtown only ever seems to talk about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, that's true... Even the most delicious mushrooms are said to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's blessing.\nPaimon: Speaking of which, lots of the dishes in Liyue are said to have been taught and approved by Rex Lapis himself...\nPaimon: Aha! So as long as a god blesses their people with delicious food, people will worship them!\n{NICKNAME}: If their name is Paimon, sure.\nPaimon: Huh? Wait, so... {NICKNAME}, what do you believe in, then?\n{NICKNAME}: Me? Hehe... Paimon, of course.\nPaimon: Heehee, that's right!",
            "About the Wall of Samiel\tPaimon: The first time we saw the Wall of Samiel, Paimon was stunned... It seems to go on forever.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, it was built to protect the entire rainforest, after all.\nPaimon: And, it's so, so tall...\nPaimon: Who knows if {NICKNAME}'ll be able to climb all the way to the top.\n{NICKNAME}: I doubt it...? Also, why do I have to climb it, exactly?\nPaimon: Uh... because it's right there?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, even so... No.\nPaimon: The Wall of Samiel is right there in front of us!\n{NICKNAME}: I know, I know, but it's way too—\nPaimon: But it's the Wall of Samiel...\n{NICKNAME}: Fine! I'll go, okay?",
            "About Akasha Terminals\tPaimon: All these Sumeru scholars seem to wear Akasha Terminals so they can get information from the Akasha system.\nPaimon: It's like they're carrying an interactive encyclopedia with them wherever they go. Paimon's kinda jealous.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm not jealous. I have an even better encyclopedia that automatically follows me around, gives me the A-to-Z on everything in Teyvat, and the best part is, it can even talk!\nPaimon: Huh? Was that a compliment? Aw, you're making Paimon blush... Paimon definitely doesn't know as much as an encyclopedia! A-to-Y at most.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you know... maybe if you ate a little less, you'd have room for Z, too.\nPaimon: Hey!!!",
            "About Aranara Names\tPaimon: Arama, Arana, Araja, Arakavi... Whew, Aranara names are so hard to remember...\nPaimon: The only bit Paimon's sure of is that they all start with \"Ara\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Right, so if you were an Aranara, your name would be \"Arapaimon.\"\nPaimon: Yup, and as for {NICKNAME}...\nPaimon: Hmm, actually, they'd probably call you Nara {NICKNAME}...\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, we're all Nara to them...\nPaimon: So if there was someone whose actual name was \"Nara,\" what would the Aranara call them?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Nara Nara\"... I guess. Sounds kinda cute.\nPaimon: Hehe, yeah.",
            "About Aranara Cuisine\tPaimon: For some reason, the Aranara's food all tasted a little too... um, how to put this... a little too \"fresh.\"\nPaimon: It's totally different from what we usually eat.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, but their ingredients are top-quality.\nPaimon: Yeah, that's true. Still, those mushrooms and fruits were so raw, it felt like they were gonna keep growing in Paimon's stomach!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh, you're exaggerating, right? You do have a point, though — maybe the best ingredients don't need a lot of fancy cooking.\nPaimon: You're right. If the ingredients are good enough, they'll taste great even when cooked with the simplest methods.\n{NICKNAME}: Just like Paimon. Just a little salt and pepper, and—\nPaimon: Hey! For crying out loud, we're in Sumeru now! Don't you think that joke's getting a little old?",
            "About Dori's Genie\tPaimon: How did a genie that big get into Dori's lamp?\n{NICKNAME}: There's only one way to find out: In you go, Paimon.\nPaimon: Not a chance! There's no way Paimon would fit in there!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well... if you want, you can be the genie of the Serenitea Pot instead?\nPaimon: Oooh, great idea! Paimon's down!\n{NICKNAME}: You seem pretty excited about this...\nPaimon: Uh, yeah! Paimon's been wanting to try this for ages! ...Poof! Didst thou summon me, O Traveler from a distant land?\nPaimon: Come on, come on, now you have to grant Paimon three wishes! Paimon's first wish is... bring Paimon lots of delicious food!\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon, you're not supposed to be the one making wishes!",
            "About Bimarstan\tPaimon: Whoa, healthcare is FREE in Sumeru?\n{NICKNAME}: Are you feeling unwell, Paimon?\nPaimon: No, not right now. Thanks for asking, though.\nPaimon: Hehe... Eating the street food on every corner has never sounded so tempting!\n{NICKNAME}: Your stomach is gonna punish you for that!\nPaimon: If so, Paimon'll go see a doctor and get treated — it's all for free! It'd be a waste not to take advantage of this, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe... But then again, the treatment would likely include a restricted diet.\nPaimon: *gasp* Oh no! So no more delicious food, then?\n{NICKNAME}: That, plus the doctor would make you take the most bitter-tasting medicine ever.\nPaimon: O—Okay... Maybe Paimon needs to reconsider this idea...",
            "About the Scholars\tPaimon: So many people in Sumeru want to become scholars.\nPaimon: Motivated by this ambition, they all study really hard to try and achieve it...\nPaimon: But Paimon bets that the first ever scholar didn't set out to become a scholar...\nPaimon: Hmm... so what do you think the first ever scholar's ambition was?\n{NICKNAME}: Probably... to get their research paper written as quickly as possible.\nPaimon: Huh? But isn't a scholar's ultimate goal supposed to be \"pursuing the highest and greatest knowledge\" or something?\nPaimon: Paimon's sure that it must have been because of a fervent desire for knowledge that they became Sumeru's first true scholar.\n{NICKNAME}: Writing papers is how you pursue knowledge.\nPaimon: But what about when it's the highest and greatest knowledge of all...\n{NICKNAME}: Even then, if you wanted to prove it, you'd need a research paper.\n{NICKNAME}: And after that, you'd need to start working on another paper to validate your original thesis...\nPaimon: O—Okay, Paimon's got it! Come on, don't look so sad! It's not like you have to worry about writing papers yourself!\nPaimon: ...Y—You've never had to write a paper before, right...?",
            "About Amurta\tPaimon: Paimon wants to go visit the Amurta scholars!\n{NICKNAME}: When did you become such an avid student, Paimon?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon heard that the Amurta scholars' research is all about nature.\nPaimon: Which means... they must have to research which animals are edible, and which ones taste the best, and... y'know that kind of thing!\nPaimon: Paimon thinks it'd be really fun to help them out with their research.\n{NICKNAME}: In other words, you've got a craving for some tasty, organic dishes.\nPaimon: No! Paimon genuinely thinks that it's a really meaningful research topic and wants to help out!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, well in that case... I think the Amurta scholars might be more interested to find out about Paimon's species and behavioral patterns.\nPaimon: Uh... Gee is that the time? Paimon just remembered we have something else more important to do!",
            "About Sumpter Beasts\tPaimon: Sumpter Beasts are adorable! Paimon likes how the people who keep them give them each a special name based on their most distinctive traits!\n{NICKNAME}: For all we know, the Sumpter Beasts might be giving each of us a name in return. Maybe that's how they respond when we call their name.\nPaimon: Really? So what kind of name do think they'd give us?\n{NICKNAME}: (Sumpter Beast noises)\nPaimon: How is anyone supposed to understand that!\n{NICKNAME}: A rough translation would be...\n{NICKNAME}: \"Vociferous Pestiferous Melliculus Niveous Micro-Bipedal.\"\n{NICKNAME}: That's the scientific name, of course.\nPaimon: Oh? What would the common name be then?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Noisy Two-Legged Critter\"\nPaimon: Hey! Why keep only the negative traits?",
            "About the Seventh Darshan\tPaimon: There are six Darshans in Sumeru.\nPaimon: It would be cool if Paimon had her own Darshan too!\nPaimon: It'll be called... Paimonology!\n{NICKNAME}: And... what wisdom would Paimonology stand for?\nPaimon: Uh... practical wisdom for everyday life!\n{NICKNAME}: So Paimonology scholars would specialize in the art of cooking slimes in a hundred different ways, and never letting a single Mora escape their grasp, and giving people ugly nicknames... et cetera, et cetera?\nPaimon: Whoa, you read Paimon's mind! Also, don't forget \"How to Become the Best Travel Guide in Teyvat\"!\nPaimon: This is a fantastic idea! Come on, let's go submit a Darshan application to the Akademiya! From this day on, {NICKNAME}'ll be the Grand Sage of Paimonology!\n{NICKNAME}: I'd like to decline the honor, please...",
            "About Shroomboars\tPaimon: Did you know that there are all kinds of strange Shroom-Kin in Sumeru?\n{NICKNAME}: Yup. Here's a fun one — legend has it that there were some forest boars who couldn't live without mushrooms, and the two species gradually formed a symbiotic relationship with each other. Now they're known as \"Shroomboars.\"\nPaimon: Woah, that's a lot like us! Paimon can't live without {NICKNAME} either.\n{NICKNAME}: If you can't live without me, that means...

Paimon wishes she could do that.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, if you're serious about it, there's no reason you couldn't learn.\nPaimon: What? Really?\n{NICKNAME}: Well for starters, you have a natural advantage when it comes to dancing.\n{NICKNAME}: You won't trip over yourself, or accidentally step on someone's foot...\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon always forgets how useful flying can be!\nPaimon: Alright then! Let's go bust a move at the Grand Bazaar and watch everyone shower Paimon with admiration!\n{NICKNAME}: Aha, so that's what this is all about.",
            "About Divination\tPaimon: People in Sumeru seem to take divination and fortune-telling pretty seriously.\nPaimon: For starters, there's astrology, although only the scholars get to practice that. But ordinary citizens have their ways, too. They can do divinations with just a cup of coffee!\n{NICKNAME}: It's the nation of wisdom after all. It seems like people have an insatiable curiosity to learn about everything, including their own future.\nPaimon: Paimon heard that they can tell your fate just by looking at the bottom of a finished cup of coffee...\nPaimon: Sounds way easier than climbing to the top of a tower and staring at the stars all night!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, so you're interested in learning your fate now?\nPaimon: Yeah... although, Paimon's really more interested in finding out what the coffee tastes like.",
            "About Purbiruni and Pursina\tPaimon: Khedive and Anisa kept talking about \"Purbiruni\" this and \"Pursina\" that...\nPaimon: Why do all these words have \"pur\" at the front?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Pur\" means \"descendant,\" and also \"student\"... So in this case, they're referring to themselves as the children and students of the great sages of old.\nPaimon: Huh, so that's what it means... From the way they were throwing these words around, Paimon was sure it'd be something to be proud of.\n{NICKNAME}: Wait... But isn't it?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon for one would much rather be known as the founding father than have a name that basically says \"So-and-so's my daddy.\" Pretty embarrassing, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Um... Yeah, I have to admit, I've never thought about it like that...",
            "About Studying Abroad\tPaimon: It's not only Sumeru locals at the Akademiya, huh. There are students from other nations too.\nPaimon: Imagine leaving your hometown behind and traveling to a faraway and unfamiliar land in the pursuit of learning... How inspiring!\n{NICKNAME}: We travel to unfamiliar lands pretty often, too.\nPaimon: Huh, you're right! That means we're also super inspiring!\n{NICKNAME}: Not in the pursuit of learning, though.\nPaimon: Oh... So we're not as inspiring as the students after all...\nPaimon: Buuut we do know the best places to eat in Sumeru, and who you can rely on to help you out! That counts as knowledge, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, and to many people, it could be extremely valuable knowledge.\nPaimon: Great, so we're just as inspiring as them after all!",
            "About the Divine Tree\tPaimon: The whole of Sumeru City is built on top of a giant tree. How amazing is that!\nPaimon: We've seen lots of incredible trees on our journey, haven't we? There's our old stomping ground at Windrise, the Frostbearing Tree on Dragonspine, and the Sacred Sakura in Inazuma!\nPaimon: Sumeru's tree doesn't seem to have a fancy name though. People just call it \"the Divine Tree\"...\n{NICKNAME}: Sometimes, the most important things have the simplest names.\nPaimon: Really? Hmm, maybe you have a point. Long names would be kinda inconvenient if you had to say them every day.\nPaimon: Anyway, people in the city only have to say \"down below\" and everyone knows they mean the bottom of the tree.\nPaimon: What's that saying again? \"Names aren't things themselves, they're just words for things.\"\n{NICKNAME}: So is Paimon just a word for a thing, too?\nPaimon: Yeah. Well, uh, kinda. But... wait, no! No, Paimon is just Paimon!",
            "About Inter-Darshan Relations\tPaimon: So, with Sumeru having so many scholars in different Darshans, do you think they end up arguing a lot?\nPaimon: You know, just like the rivalry between Li cuisine and Yue cuisine in Liyue.\n{NICKNAME}: I'm sure they do. Conflict between different schools of thought is the most normal thing ever. As the Liyue martial arts novels say: \"Wherever there are people, there will be conflict.\"\nPaimon: Wow, what a line. That's heavy... But the scholars in Sumeru probably don't duel like Liyue martial artists, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe they settle things with a game of Genius Invokation TCG.\nPaimon: Ohh, good point! A duel of wits!\nPaimon: Paimon can just imagine it: When one scholar can't convince another in an argument, he takes out his deck of cards, calmly sits down opposite his opponent, thinks for a moment, and then secures his victory!\n{NICKNAME}: That does sound like something that would happen in Sumeru.\nPaimon: The game ends, and the winner says \"good game\" as a sign of respect to his opponent. After that, both sides are back on good terms.\n{NICKNAME}: Umm, not necessarily...\nPaimon: Huh? Why?",
            "About Port Ormos\tPaimon: Whew, Port Ormos definitely has a different vibe to Sumeru City...\nPaimon: It's a bustling area, and there's so many outlanders. Plus, no one needs to spend all their time buried in their studies, which is nice.\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that's why they end up being disciplined by the port authorities. So you see, Paimon? If you don't study hard, you'll end up just like them!\nPaimon: Oh...\nPaimon: Wait! What was that tone of voice for!?",
            "About the Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys\tPaimon: Port Ormos is built on the ruins of the fortress of The Alliance of the... the... the alliance of something, anyway.\nPaimon: Ugh, the name's too long, Paimon can't remember it! Anyway, that's what all the bookish people in Sumeru say.\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, you mean \"The Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys\"?\n{NICKNAME}: Apparently, the alliance was formed by a bunch of arrogant pirate leaders, none of whom wanted to work for any of the others. They fought and looted each other constantly, causing endless chaos in coastal Sumeru...\n{NICKNAME}: Finally, one day, they decided to enter into an alliance with one another and divide power equally between themselves. The members of the alliance were called \"Deys\"...\nPaimon: Oh... And so after that... there was no more fighting and no more stealing, so everyone could get along happily and make a boatload of Mora together! Right?\n{NICKNAME}: ...\nPaimon: Right...?\n{NICKNAME}: Well... presumably that's what they were hoping...\nPaimon: Huh...?\n{NICKNAME}: Before long, they were forming factions again, and the infighting between them escalated into the biggest internal battle they'd seen yet. Their fortress at Port Ormos was completely destroyed, and all the Deys were done for!\nPaimon: Whaaat?\n{NICKNAME}: Following that, an unprecedented period of peace finally came to Port Ormos, and the area began to develop into what we see today...\nPaimon: Huh... So the Alliance was just a bunch of dumb bad guys...",
            "About Cyno and Genius Invokation TCG...\tPaimon: Cyno's super into that card game \"Genius Invokation TCG,\" isn't he?\nPaimon: Doesn't it seem kinda weird for the General Mahamatra to be into playing cards...?\n{NICKNAME}: Well... not when you consider his hairstyle.\nPaimon: Huh? What has his hairstyle got to do with it?\n{NICKNAME}: You know, when you're playing a card game, the fancier your hairstyle, the more distracting it is for your opponent.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What's going on with this guy? How did he manage to shape his hair like that?\"\n{NICKNAME}: When your opponent's mind is consumed with thoughts like this, you'll quickly gain the upper hand.\nPaimon: Hmm, really? Then we'd better think twice before playing against him...\n{NICKNAME}: I don't know... I think I might just have an advantage over him.\nPaimon: But you don't have a fancy hairstyle at all. And your clothes look pretty normal, too...\n{NICKNAME}: But I do have Paimon.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What's up with her? And what's that pesky flying companion of hers up to?\"\n{NICKNAME}: As long as Paimon is floating by my side, Cyno's mind will be consumed with thoughts like this.\n{NICKNAME}: I, on the other hand, would be completely unfazed by his hairstyle. So I'd be able to focus, and victory would be mine.\nPaimon: Forget it! If you wanna play cards, go get a funny haircut!",
            "About Sumeru Nursery Rhymes...\tPaimon: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ Hungry children it's time to come home~ ♪\n{NICKNAME}: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ ♪\nPaimon: Wow! Good job, so you remember the tune as well!\n{NICKNAME}: Good job to you too, Paimon. You sing really well.\nPaimon: Heehee, that's because Paimon's got a great plan!\nPaimon: Have you heard this story? Once upon a time, there was a hilihound who was given meat to eat whenever the samachurls started dancing. Eventually, the hilihound started drooling whenever it heard the sound of dancing.\nPaimon: Whenever we hear the curry song, we get curry to eat. So, all Paimon has to do is learn the song by heart, and then in the future, whenever Paimon is craving a big bowl of tasty curry, all she has to do is sing it!\nPaimon: Hey, aren't you gonna say something?\nPaimon: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ Hungry children it's time to come home~ ♪",
            "About Aranara Tongue Twisters...\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, do you ever find that the word \"Aranara\" trips you up?\nPaimon: Hmm? Why, does it trip you up? Maybe that's because you don't really say anything most of the time.\nPaimon: Unlike Paimon! Paimon has to talk all the time, so she never gets stuck on words.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well, try reading this then.\nPaimon: What is it? Let's see here...\nPaimon: Arana the Aranara exercises Ararakalari in the nearby area.\nPaimon: Narana the Nara picks Padisarahs in a parallel area further afield.\nPaimon: Narana the Padisarah-picking Nara had arranged to invite Arana the Aranara to the bar to befriend Lambad, but alas, Arana the Ararakalari-exercising Aranara professed a preference to Padisarah-picking Nara, Narana, for venturing to Vanarana to view the panorama.\nPaimon: On account of Arana the Aranara's antipathy to bar drama, Narana the Nara relented and, upon accompanying the latter on a Vanarana-panorama adventure, encountered another Aranara, named \"Arama.\"\nPaimon: This must be one of those really weird dreams, right...\nPaimon: Ugh, but this headache feels pretty real...",
            "About the Prophesied Crisis...\tPaimon: Paimon just thought of a great way to deal with Fontaine's prophesied crisis!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, let's hear it.\nPaimon: You know those great big clockwork meka they use for digging tunnels? Well, why not send them deep underwater and get them to dig a load of drainage holes? Then no one'll have to worry about the water level rising anymore.\n{NICKNAME}: Sounds logical enough, but where do you think the water will go?\nPaimon: Ah, what does that matter! Think of it like... a coin pouch. When there's a hole in it, what's the use in racking your brains trying to figure out where all the Mora went? 'Cause the fact is, a coin pouch with a hole wouldn't be able to hold it all anyway.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'd certainly like to know where all my Mora goes. But from what you're saying, it doesn't sound like you keep track...\nPaimon: Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Paimon doesn't know where your... uh, P—Paimon doesn't know where your... Mora goes... hehe, heh...",
            "About Magic...\tPaimon: Lyney's magic shows are amazing! Paimon never would've guessed how he did it before he revealed his secret.\n{NICKNAME}: Hold on... I just thought of a magic trick!\nPaimon: Huh? You know how to do magic too?\n{NICKNAME}: Yep. I can make a big magician's hat float in the air, and even make it move at my command.\nPaimon: Whoa! Really? How do you do that?\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, simple! I put Paimon inside the hat.\nPaimon: What? Why would Paimon be... Ohhh, so Paimon's the one making it float!\nPaimon: Hehe, in that case, Paimon has an idea for an even better magic trick!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? What is it?\nPaimon: Behold, the bottomless hat! No matter how many plates of delicious food you throw into it, it'll never get full!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... Wait, so where would the plates go?\nPaimon: Oh, good point! Umm... Oh, the hat spits the empty plates back out! Tada! Whaddya think?",
            "About Patented Flying Technology...\tPaimon: Fontaine's aquabuses are pretty cool. But imagine if they could run without tracks. Then you could go anywhere you want pretty much without having to move a muscle! Traveling would be way less tiring.\n{NICKNAME}: But you already fly everywhere. Does that even get tiring?\nPaimon: Fly... Fly? Wait, that's it! If we could find a way to make the boats float in the air, then they wouldn't need rails anymore. Hehe, and we could call them \"airboats\"!\nPaimon: C'mon, let's go apply for one of those, uh... oh yeah — \"patents\"! We can't let Paimon's genius go to waste. Quick, before someone else beats us to it!\n{NICKNAME}: Patents don't work like that... You can't just have a name for your invention. You also need to provide details of the original technical solution that makes your airboats float.\nPaimon: Technical, huh? Hmm... Okay, got it! We just need to attach a giant propeller on top of the boats!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay... But how would you prevent the boat from spinning along with the propeller? And how would you control the direction of movement?\nPaimon: Um... Uh... Ugh. Paimon never realized flying was so complicated! It's always been second nature to Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Well, there might be an easier solution if we ditch the direction and speed control requirements?\nPaimon: Huh? Really!?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. It involves starting at a high altitude and flying downwards at a rapidly-increasing velocity.\nPaimon: Hey! That isn't flying, that's free-falling!",
            "About the Dark Side of Publishing...\tPaimon: The Steambird's Great Detective Hurlock series is gonna be published by Yae Publishing House, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Seems like it.\nPaimon: But The Steambird clearly doesn't need help with printing and distribution. Why don't they just publish it themselves?\n{NICKNAME}: Hehehe, you still have a lot to learn about the dark side of the publishing industry...\nPaimon: Ugh, okay, you know-it-all! Go on then, give Paimon one good reason why The Steambird can't publish its own novels, when it already publishes a newspaper that's read all over Teyvat.\n{NICKNAME}: Because the key to a successful light novel is...\nPaimon: Uh-huh?\n{NICKNAME}: The illustrations!\nPaimon: What!? No way. Try telling that to all the writers and editors in Teyvat! They're the ones working their butts off coming up with ideas!\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe so, but the Yae Publishing House has all the best illustrators on their payroll, and poaching them can't be easy. Artists like Calx must be virtually impossible to contact without going through them.\nPaimon: Ohhh... Yeah, that's a fair point.\n{NICKNAME}: Mm-hmm. But there's another reason, too...\nPaimon: Hm?\n{NICKNAME}: Only works published by the Yae Publishing House make it into Genius Invokation TCG crossovers!\nPaimon: Huh, Paimon never knew!\n{NICKNAME}: That's the deepest, darkest secret of the publishing industry: It's not about stories anymore, it's about products and how to commercialize them.\nPaimon: Hmph! That's just... sickening!",
            "About Armchair Detectives...\tPaimon: So apparently, some detectives in Fontaine manage to solve cases without ever setting foot outside their homes. They call them \"armchair detectives\"...\nPaimon: That's what they call \"working from home,\" right? Sounds pretty cushy.\nPaimon: Still, how do they figure out the truth if they never even go to the crime scene? ...Oh, Paimon knows! They must be using divination.\n{NICKNAME}: You're thinking of fortune-tellers, Paimon. Not detectives.\nPaimon: Oh... yeah...\n{NICKNAME}: In any case, surely the evidence isn't just dropping itself off at the detective's doorstep.\nPaimon: You mean... Oh, the detective must have people collecting information for them...\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps, or... Maybe they post commissions at the Adventurers' Guild?\nPaimon: Huh? But... that would mean the detective gets all the credit for our hard work! Bet they make a tidy sum of Mora off of it, too! Hmph, Paimon won't stand for that. Let's go have a little talk with Detective Armchair right now!",
            "About the Mysterious Treasure of the Fontaine Research Institute...\tPaimon: At the Fontaine Research Institute, they research clockwork and different energy sources, right? So how come there are rumors about a mystery treasure?\nPaimon: It'd make more sense if the treasure was owned by a bandit or a pirate.\nPaimon: But Paimon's not sure that the researchers' and technicians' definition of \"treasure\" is really mysterious enough to get excited about...\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... What about \"researcher by day, bandit by night\"? Does that sound mysterious enough?\nPaimon: Umm... Well for starters, it sounds exhausting. Imagine finishing your day job, then working a whole other job all night... When would they get time to rest?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe they wouldn't need to rest... If they were actually a clockwork meka in disguise!\nPaimon: Ooh! A mystery treasure left by a clockwork meka who's a researcher by day and a bandit by night... Now that sounds more like it!",
            "About the Big No-No of Detective Novels...\tPaimon: Detective stories like \"Great Detective Hurlock\" and \"The Case Files of Miss Orith\" are really popular in Fontaine.\n{NICKNAME}: They're also pretty complex. Can you even follow the plot?\nPaimon: Don't you underestimate Paimon! If Paimon read any of those novels, she'd definitely solve the mystery before she's even halfway through.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well if you do, then keep it to yourself. You don't want to spoil the story for anyone else.\nPaimon: Paimon would never do that!\n{NICKNAME}: Although you also have to watch out for people who use \"no spoilers\" as an excuse to shut down discussions, when the truth is, they're just annoyed that a story they can't stand is getting so much attention.\nPaimon: Huh. Well, Paimon doesn't read much, so she wouldn't know anything about that kinda thing.\n{NICKNAME}: You see it a lot when two fans of Onibudou get talking. Someone'll butt in and say something like, \"Stop, don't spoil it for me! I'm only up to chapter two of volume one!\"\nPaimon: Chapter two? Hah, yeah, clearly they have no intention of reading any further.\n{NICKNAME}Hey Paimon... You wanna hear a secret?\nPaimon: Um... sure?\n{NICKNAME}: Listen carefully...\nPaimon: Mm-hmm?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Zhongli is Rex Lapis.\nPaimon: *gasp* What a crazy twist! Why would you spoil— Wait a second, we figured out that one ages ago!",
            "About Claiming Self-Defense...\t{NICKNAME}: Pro tip. While we're in Fontaine, if someone ever picks a fight with you, you should never fight back unless there are witnesses around.\nPaimon: Huh? Why's that?\n{NICKNAME}: 'Cause without any evidence, the court'll probably reject your claim of self-defense, and they'll just rule that it was an intentional street fight.\nPaimon: Okay, and then what?\n{NICKNAME}: Well if that happens, you'll almost certainly end up having to duel before you're put to trial.\n{NICKNAME}: At that point, you'll either have to fight the same person all over again, or go head-to-head with their Champion Duelist.\nPaimon: ...Paimon just feels bad for whoever has to fight you.",
            "About The Steambird's Editors...\tPaimon: Pretty crazy how things that happened only yesterday show up in today's issue of The Steambird...\nPaimon: Even stuff that happened late at night way outside the city makes it in. How do they manage to get these articles written up so quickly?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, not to mention printed first thing in the morning.\nPaimon: Hehe, Paimon gets it! There must be a magic printer at The Steambird's office. As soon as the reporters bring in the latest news, they feed it to the printer, and it goes om-nom-nom-nom-nom, gobbling all the writing up ready to spit it back out when it's printing time!\nPaimon: They probably have some reporters bursting in through the doors at the last minute, yelling \"WAIT! There's one last article to feed to the printer!\"\n{NICKNAME}: That's definitely a very compelling image. But as far as I know, magic printers like that don't exist — it's all thanks to the tireless work of the editing team that The Steambird gets printed on time every day. They sit there going \"Huh? Hmph! Uhh... Oh no!\" as they race through correcting spelling errors, then they squeeeeeeeze it all into neat vertical columns of text, and run to their colleagues shouting \"Just give me five more minutes, please!\" That's the real magic behind meeting publishing deadlines.\nPaimon: Whoa... It's pretty amazing that they're able to make a whole newspaper in just one day. Do they ever get time to sleep?",
            "About Fontaine's Novels...\tPaimon: Huh, novels in Fontaine have weirdly long names. This one's called \"Do Clockwork Meka Dream of Cogwheel Chiropractors?\"\nPaimon: But the writing style and themes are pretty different from Inazuma's light novels.\n{NICKNAME}: According to the synopsis, this novel is about a clockwork meka experiencing back pain due to bending over for extended periods. It finally gives in, quits its job as an illustrator, then goes on a long journey looking for a chiropractor to cure its mechanical spine...\nPaimon: That actually sounds pretty interesting.\n{NICKNAME}: But why a chiropractor, though? Wouldn't an engineer do the job better? They could just go to the Fontaine Research Institute, and save themselves the long journey.\nPaimon: Well yeah, but... Having met some of the engineers from the institute, Paimon can see why they wouldn't want to...\n{NICKNAME}: Oh yeah, that's true. But anyway, even though the protagonist of the story is a clockwork meka, you can still tell that it was written by a human. Imagine if they got a real clockwork meka to write a novel... I wonder what they'd write about?\nPaimon: Hmm... How about this: \"I Awoke One Morning and Found Myself Human!\"\n{NICKNAME}: Hey, that's a good one, Paimon.",
            "About Trials and Shows...\tPaimon: The Opera Epiclese is used for both criminal trials and performances, so... wait...\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? What's bothering you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Well, what if someone did a show about a criminal trial there? How would the audience be able to tell whether it's a real trial or not?\n{NICKNAME}: That's a very good question. Can you imagine the looks that the actor playing the criminal would get out on the street the following day? Everyone who recognized them would say \"Hey! Weren't you the one on trial yesterday!?\"\nPaimon: Yeah, exactly! It would get sooo confusing!\n{NICKNAME}: The actor would constantly be telling everyone: \"It was just a show, for goodness' sake! Stop treating it like it's real!\"\nPaimon: Hmph, well they'd only have themselves to blame. What do they expect, staging a show about a trial in the Opera Epiclese? Clearly they're just trying to confuse people. What a terrible idea.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, it is a terrible idea. What were you thinking, Paimon!?\nPaimon: Wait, what? Nothing! Just... what a terrible idea it would be if... someone... came up with that idea...",
            "About Fonta...\tPaimon: Fonta tastes amazing, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Yep. It's so refreshing, especially when you down the whole thing in one big gulp.\nPaimon: Can you buy a glass for Paimon? Paimon's always wanted to try that thing.\n{NICKNAME}: What thing?\nPaimon: Just buy it, you'll see in a minute!\nPaimon: Glug glug glug glug...\nPaimon: Ahhhhh.\nPaimon: That's what those drunkards do after they clink their glasses together. Paimon's been itching to try it for ages!\n{NICKNAME}: Don't imitate them, Paimon... It's not a good look on you.",
            "About Gardemeks...\tPaimon: Gardemeks carry out whatever task they're programmed to do. So basically, they can do whatever you tell them to!\n{NICKNAME}: Got another bright idea, Paimon?\nPaimon: Yep! Paimon needs a commission-handling Gardemek, a material-harvesting Gardemek, and a domain-exploring Gardemek...\nPaimon: Ooh, and a gourmet-chef Gardemek, too! Then we can sit back and enjoy our new, fully automated lifestyle!\n{NICKNAME}: They're extremely expensive to own and operate, though. And don't forget there's maintenance and repair costs as well.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, lemme do some quick napkin-math here... Using a Gardemek, the average cost to harvest a single Mint would come to around 6,300 Mora...\nPaimon: What!? That's eye wateringly expensive...\nPaimon: ...Suddenly, Paimon feels like we adventurers don't get paid enough for the high-value work we do!",
            "About Diving...\tPaimon: Fontaine's underwater world is so pretty! There's so many kinds of fish that Paimon's never seen before.\n{NICKNAME}: If only we could swim underwater in other places too.\nPaimon: Yeah, it's a real shame...\nPaimon: If you could go diving anywhere you wanted, where would you choose?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Probably... either Liyue Harbor or Guyun Stone Forest.\nPaimon: Ooh, great idea! There's gotta be some sunken ships around there full of treasure! We could make a fortune!\n{NICKNAME}: Ooh, there's also Sangonomiya Shrine in Inazuma. The view underwater must be stunning around there. So, what about you, Paimon? Where would you go?\nPaimon: Let Paimon think... Well, since you already chose places in Liyue and Inazuma, Paimon's gonna go for... Cider Lake!\n{NICKNAME}: Not a bad choice. But you gotta be careful, because just when you're swimming along, minding your own business...\nPaimon: Y—Yeah?\n{NICKNAME}: Suddenly, you notice something slowly sinking in front of you...\nPaimon: Huh!?\n{NICKNAME}: It's round and chubby, with a red-and-white pattern on its surface. The moment you realize what it is, you know it's already too late...\nPaimon: A Jumpy Dumpty!\n{NICKNAME}: BOOM!\nPaimon: Waaaaaah! And Paimon goes flying into the sky!",
            "About Art...\tPaimon: There seems to be a lot of eccentric artists in the Court of Fontaine. Apparently, they often stage artistic performances at the opera house, too.\nPaimon: The people of Fontaine sure place a lot of importance on the arts. Guess that's why they call it the \"City of the Arts\"!\nPaimon: It's nothing like Sumeru, where people had to do their performances in secret...\n{NICKNAME}: You're pretty into the arts, huh?\nPaimon: Of course! Paimon's pretty much a connoisseur.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, so what makes something \"art\" in your opinion?\nPaimon: Well... Art should be something that's out of the ordinary. Something that sparkles like the stars at night!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... By that definition, I have a work of art following me around wherever I go.\nPaimon: ...Huh?\nPaimon: Wait... You don't mean Paimon, do you?\n{NICKNAME}: Yup! And now that I think about it, you should consider doing a performance some time. Paimon, live at the opera house... I bet a lot of people would go to see that.\nPaimon: No way! Not gonna happen!",
            "About Fixing Malfunctions...\tPaimon: You know what's strange? Clockwork meka are extremely intricate, and yet people regularly manage to fix them just by whacking them a few times. How does that work?\n{NICKNAME}: I guess if a gear or drive shaft comes loose, sometimes whacking it or giving it a shake is enough to make the parts latch back on to each other.\nPaimon: Huh? Paimon didn't follow that...\n{NICKNAME}: Well, simply put, if the meka isn't actually broken, a little tap can nudge the parts back into the right places.\n{NICKNAME}: But on the other hand, if one of the parts is damaged, then no amount of whacking is ever gonna fix it.\nPaimon: Ohh! So it's like knocking sense into people. It works fine as long as they've got a brain, and they're just having a dumb moment. But if they're a total airhead, there's nowhere for the sense to go!\nPaimon: ...Wait, why are you staring at Paimon's forehead?\n{NICKNAME}: Don't worry, I'm not gonna whack you in the head. It wouldn't work anyway.\nPaimon: Phew, well that's a relief— Wait... Hey!",
            "About the Fortress of Meropide...\tPaimon: So there's this place in Fontaine called the Fortress of Meropide. Was it named after someone called Meropide?\n{NICKNAME}: I've never heard anything about that, but you could be right.\nPaimon: Paimon's kinda envious. Having a building named after you must be an amazing feeling... When you have the time, can you build something in your Serenitea Pot and name it \"the Fortress of Paimon\"?\n{NICKNAME}: Sure. In fact, I can do one better — I'll build it in downtown Fontaine.\nPaimon: Really? But surely that'd be way too expensive. Are you sure you can afford it?\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, absolutely. It won't actually cost that much.\nPaimon: Wow, you're so generous! So, what're you gonna build...?\n{NICKNAME}: I was thinking a cozy little clay... bungalow, with a wood-burner for under-floor heating, a waterbed... a few chopped onions, salt and pepper, some greens... and, um...\nPaimon: Hey! Ugh, you are unbelievable! Can't we get through one nation without you cracking this stupid joke!?",
            "About Supermeka...\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that the earliest clockwork components ever invented actually work on a very simple principle!\nPaimon: You take a long object made from a durable material, bend it, and wait for it to return to its original shape. As it rebounds, you can use the energy it gives off to power gears and stuff, and then you basically have an engine!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... A long object made from a durable material... *gasp* You know what that reminds me of?\n{NICKNAME}: Cryo and Pyro Regisvines! Don't you think?\nPaimon: Eek! Of all the things you could've thought of, why those two?\nPaimon: Huh, but come to think of it, the regisvines are pretty good at whipping their stalks around...\n{NICKNAME}: And they're really strong too. If you let them charge up their energy and swing at you...\n{NICKNAME}: They'll knock down anyone in their path. Even me — and we both know how strong I am!\nPaimon: So are you saying that... you could turn the Regisvines into a clockwork mechanism?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, think about it. Since Cryo and Pyro lifeforms are highly incompatible, if we put them both next to each other at a slight incline, so their necks are tilted towards one another...\n{NICKNAME}: They'd spin non-stop to avoid touching each other!\n{NICKNAME}: It would be the world's most powerful clockwork mechanism! Once we found a way to harness it, it would generate enough energy to power most of the machines in Fontaine!\nPaimon: Ohhh! Yeah, you're right!\nPaimon: This is a genius idea! Eat your heart out, Fontaine Research Institute!\nPaimon: All we need to do now is find a way to bring the Regisvines to Fontaine, put them in position, and...\nPaimon: Wait a sec... How the heck are we gonna get those overgrown ferns to Fontaine?\n{NICKNAME}: As soon as we've tackled the minor issues of practicality and cost-effectiveness...\n{NICKNAME}: ...How about we explore the details ahead of us later?",
            "About Underwater Cafés...\tPaimon: Paimon thought we'd be saying goodbye to the amazing cafés after we left Sumeru. But it seems like people in Fontaine are big coffee drinkers too!\n{NICKNAME}: They sure are. Even the newspapers run articles about how great coffee is at keeping you awake and alert. And at boosting your energy levels, so you can keep performing at peak efficiency during a long working day.\nPaimon: Whew, any job where you need coffee to stay energized must be exhausting...\nPaimon: Like, umm... Blacksmiths? Maybe chefs too... And adventurers — they're always running around all over the place. Hey, and what about divers?\n{NICKNAME}: Divers, huh? That's definitely the odd one out here...\n{NICKNAME}: How are divers supposed to drink coffee when they work underwater the entire time?\nPaimon: Yeah, that's a good question!\nPaimon: They can't take off their helmets underwater, so they'd probably have to shut themselves inside an even bigger glass box and drain all the water out before they could finally drink their coffee. Probably from a bottle...\nPaimon: No, wait... If the coffee's already in a bottle, all they'd need is a long straw that goes from the bottle into their helmet. Then they'd be able to take a sip of coffee whenever they want!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, eww, haha. But then the coffee would go cold!\n{NICKNAME}: Cold coffee is just gross. With the important exception of iced coffee, but that's its own thing.\nPaimon: Well that's no problem. They can just bring a stove with them underwater.\nPaimon: You've seen the kind of stove that most people use in Fontaine, right? It only has one small opening up at the top. As long as that's sealed nice and tight, it won't go out even underwater!\nPaimon: Wait a second... No way, is that... That's it! That must be the whole reason stoves in Fontaine are made that way!\n{NICKNAME}: Ding ding ding, right answer! That is indeed the reason behind the design of the Fontaine-style stove.\nPaimon: Hehe, Paimon's the smartest!\nPaimon: Hey, how about we open an underwater café? Paimon bets there's lots of divers out there craving some coffee while they're down in the depths... Yeah, this could be a huge opportunity for us!\nPaimon: Once we open the world's first-ever underwater café, the Mora will come rolling in! Heck, and why stop at cafés? The ocean's our oyster! We could build a whole shopping mall down there! Then a whole underwater business district...\nPaimon: Hee-hee! Ah, it's gotta be the best feeling in the world, making Mora through your very own stroke of business genius!\n{NICKNAME}: Just one thing, okay? ...Don't go taking out a loan in my name!",
            "About The Steambird...\tPaimon: The Steambird's head office is in Fontaine, right? Paimon wonders what stories make it into their newspapers.\nPaimon: Do you think they reported on our adventures with Dvalin? Or our duel with the Raiden Shogun? Oh, and everything that happened at the Akademiya!\n{NICKNAME}: I'm sure they cover just about everything that goes on. It's more a question of where it would appear — they probably have different sections reserved for different topics.\nPaimon: Ooh, well in that case, we must make it onto the front page all the time! Surely that's where all the most exciting stories go.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... I'm not so sure. We might've made front-page news once or twice, I guess. But I wouldn't be surprised if the headlines mostly focus on hit new operas or well-known actors.\n{NICKNAME}: You know, stuff like, \"Actor X Spotted Drinking Coffee on Street,\" \"Actor Y Goes Public About New Relationship,\" or \"Actor Z to Retire From Performing.\"\nPaimon: Why would they fill the best page with stuff like that? It's completely pointless.\n{NICKNAME}: Well... trivial, maybe, but not pointless. Those are the stories that grab people's attention and convince them to buy the paper to get all the details.\nPaimon: *sigh* ...Fine. Well... Maybe we'll be on the first few pages then? Surely, they've gotta put some real news in there. And it's gotta be interesting enough to keep people reading after they've gotten their dose of celebrity gossip. Right?\n{NICKNAME}: The first few pages cover positive local news stories in the Court of Fontaine. Things like food and commodity prices going down, or progress updates on the aquabus expansions.\n{NICKNAME}: They put these reports at the most prominent locations inside the newspaper. The point of them is mostly just to kill time.\n{NICKNAME}: What goes on at the Akademiya might be important, but it doesn't directly impact the lives of people in Fontaine.\nPaimon: Huh... So, where would they put our stories then?\n{NICKNAME}: I'd guess on the very back page, after everything else.\nPaimon: Aww... Why so far back!?\n{NICKNAME}: I think they call it... \"saving the best till last.\"\n{NICKNAME}: The editors probably embellish things a lot to flesh the story out, then break it into several chunks to make it into a series that runs over several days.\nPaimon: Alright, so... what's the \"point\" of the final page, then?\n{NICKNAME}: It gives the newspaper its \"raison d'etre.\"",
            "About Clockwork Meka...\tPaimon: Paimon was not expecting to see clockwork meka dancing... As dangerous as it is to get too close to them, it sure is nice to watch them from a distance.\nPaimon: Hehe, imagine if they had ones that could sing and play musical instruments, too. That'd be really cool!\n{NICKNAME}: Then you'd just need some meka for the audience, and you'd have a show by meka, for meka.\nPaimon: Uhhh... Somehow, that's a pretty scary thought...\nPaimon: Anyway, meka are meant to do stuff, not sit there and watch a show... Ooh! How about meka that can paint? Paimon bets their paintings would look just like photos taken with a Kamera.\n{NICKNAME}: Sounds like you could just use a Kamera.\nPaimon: Oh, right, yeah... Hmm...\nPaimon: Ugh, Paimon's brain's stopped working. What about you? If you could make a clockwork meka do anything at all, what would it be?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Travel guiding, perhaps.\n{NICKNAME}: Bleep-blorp. This is your guidebot speaking. Please go straight on at the next crossroads. Bloop-blerp.\nPaimon: Uh, P—Paimon's just remembered how much training you need before you can own a clockwork meka! And how expensive they are! Also, who knows if they even work outside of Fontaine, heh...\nPaimon: The best travel guide in Teyvat will not lose her job to some machine! At least... at least not yet!",
            "About Fountains...\tPaimon: There always seems to be people throwing Mora into the fountain on Erinnyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. Supposedly, the fountain fairies listen to people's wishes. That's probably how the custom began.\nPaimon: Huh? So even fountain fairies need Mora?\nPaimon: Whoa, they must be living the dream! All they need to do is find a fountain to live in, and they're all set! No need to work, just sit back and wait for people to literally throw Mora to you.\n{NICKNAME}: I don't think that's quite how it works... You have to grant wishes, remember?\nPaimon: Oh, okay, well... \"Oh young traveler, your wishes have been heard. Which lost sword is it that you seek? The Dull Blade, or the Silver Sword?\"\n{NICKNAME}: They both look like trash, to be honest.\nPaimon: Just choose one.\n{NICKNAME}: \"Oh fair maiden of the fountain, neither of these swords is mine, and neither do I desire, for what I seek is my lost travel companion.\"\nPaimon: Huh? You... You are a sneaky one, young traveler... Okay then, the fountain fairy shall grant your wish and become your best travel companion ever!",
            "About Opera...\tPaimon: Operas in Fontaine come in so many different genres. Historical, myths and legends, even fairytales and modern romances...\n{NICKNAME}: And lots of adventure stories too.\nPaimon: Oh yeah, like \"Tancrede et Chariclea\"! Oh Tancrede, you fool! If only you'd recognized Chariclea before it was too late...\n{NICKNAME}: Apparently, the story's based on true events.\nPaimon: Ooh... Does that mean that there'll be opera adaptations of our adventures one day?\nPaimon: We've been through so many adventures together. There's gotta be a scriptwriter out there who's interested in taking our story to the stage!\nPaimon: And they won't have to worry about crafting the perfect tragedy, either. Everyone loves a happy ending, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Ooh, how about we get a head start and assign voices to ourselves?\nPaimon: Hmm... Paimon thinks you have a mezzo-soprano voice. What do you think Paimon should be?\n{NICKNAME}: Remind me — what's that shrill voice that most prima donnas have?\nPaimon: Oh, you must be thinking of coloratura soprano— Hey!",
            "About Melusines...\tPaimon: Apparently, every Melusine gets their own special token when they're born. They treat it as a symbol of their very being.\n{NICKNAME}: If you were a Melusine, what would your token be?\nPaimon: Definitely a fork! To represent Paimon's lifelong mission to taste all the delicious food in the whole world!\n{NICKNAME}: Not Mora, then?\nPaimon: Ooh, good point... Yeah, if it were Mora, it'd mean that Paimon's destined to be a super rich person. Then Paimon could buy anything she wants!\nPaimon: Hmmmmm... Argh, Paimon's so torn! Both are so tempting...\n{NICKNAME}: How about a fork made from Mora? Then you can have your cake and eat it, so to speak.\nPaimon: Wow, that's a great idea!\nPaimon: Anyway, enough about Paimon. Your token would probably be... a cooking pot, to represent being Paimon's personal gourmet chef!\n{NICKNAME}: No no no, my token would be Paimon.\nPaimon: Aw, really?\n{NICKNAME}: With Paimon as my token, everything that you have would ultimately belong to me.\nPaimon: Uh... Okay sure. Friends share everything, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, yeah... My stuff would still be mine...\nPaimon: Hey, no fair!",
            "About the Palais Mermonia...\tPaimon: People in the city keep telling us how Palais Mermonia is a suuuper stressful place to work.\nPaimon: But when we went to see it for ourselves, it seemed like hardly anyone works there, and the few people who do work there were hardly working.\nPaimon: In fact, they looked like they didn't have a care in the world... What part of working there is supposed to be so stressful, exactly?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe the work they carry out is essential, but insignificant.\nPaimon: How can something be both of those things at the same time?\n{NICKNAME}: Well... Okay, so imagine that one day, you suddenly forgot how to fly and fell to the ground...\nPaimon: That'll never happen. Flying's a piece of cake for Paimon.\n{NICKNAME}: Probably not — but just in case, we should make sure that there's a cart loaded with cushions ready to catch you at all times.\n{NICKNAME}: The cart would have to be designed to withstand any environment and weather conditions, and the cushions would need to be soft enough to break your fall gently...\n{NICKNAME}: It would need to be built from the sturdiest timber and strongest rope, and packed with plenty of medical supplies and snacks...\n{NICKNAME}: And all because keeping Paimon safe and sound is absolutely essential.\nPaimon: You really mean that? Aw, thanks, hehe... But there's really no need to go to all that trouble.\nPaimon: Paimon's been flying for a really long time. There's no way Paimon's gonna suddenly drop out of the air. So you don't need to worry about it.\n{NICKNAME}: See? That's why it's insignificant.\n{NICKNAME}: If it ever did happen, the consequences would be disastrous — hence why it's essential to be prepared.\n{NICKNAME}: But practically speaking, the chances of it happening are next to nothing. So it's insignificant at the same time.\n{NICKNAME}: If someone in the Palais Mermonia was assigned a task like that, it'd be up to them to decide how busy they wanna get. Chances are, they'd probably just sit back and do nothing.\nPaimon: But... What if Paimon really does forget how to fly one day? What's gonna happen when Paimon falls to the ground?\n{NICKNAME}: I'll be here to catch you, no matter what. Because you're not \"essential but insignificant\" — you're the best travel companion ever!",
            "About the Children of Echoes' Gems...\tPaimon: Hey, so the valleys here are just bursting with shiny gemstones!\nPaimon: This could be a huge opportunity for us! We should get digging ASAP. With any luck, we'll hit the jackpot and we'll never have to worry about Mora again!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... But how would you actually know when you've hit the jackpot? Can you even tell which stones are the valuable ones?\nPaimon: Uhh, well... Paimon just figured... the shinier the stone, the more valuable it is! Yeah, that should be about right!\n{NICKNAME}: You're starting to sound like an evil fairytale dragon, hoarding all the shinies they can get their greedy claws on...\nPaimon: Hehe, except we're in Natlan now — so instead of \"evil dragon,\" it's \"noble Saurian\"!\nPaimon: \"O brave and cunning {NICKNAME}, follow this noble Saurian, for she shall lead you to the most precious gemstone in the entire world!\"\n{NICKNAME}: Great! Except she can't tell which stones are the valuable ones, so how's that gonna work?",
            "About the Scions of the Canopy...\tPaimon: The Scions of the Canopy sure do love their extreme outdoor sports. Seems like they have a real appetite for danger.\nPaimon: Free solo climbing, skysurfing, volcano parkour, bungee jumping off cliffs... Whew, even the thought of it makes Paimon light-headed!\n{NICKNAME}: Really? Honestly, some of the stuff we've done is at least as dangerous as that... We froze half to death on Dragonspine, narrowly avoided being fried in all those thunderstorms, got sandblasted in the scorching desert, stared death in the face in those eerie Withering Zones... The list goes on.\nPaimon: Huh, when you put it like that... Yeah, we've been through some pretty extreme stuff.\n{NICKNAME}: Mhm, but we're built different. Most people's idea of \"danger\" is probably just an average day on the road for us. That's probably how it is for the Scions of the Canopy with their extreme sports as well.\nPaimon: Whoa, wait a second! Let's get one thing straight: YOU might be built different, but Paimon sure as heck isn't.\nPaimon: Now, Paimon's sure you and your danger-braving buddies know what you're doing, but the second we find ourselves in serious trouble, Paimon's gonna... hide behind you until it's over.",
            "About the Hot Springs of Natlan...\tPaimon: The People of the Springs are so chill. If they're not relaxing in a hot spring, they're planning their next big soak...\n{NICKNAME}: Apparently, some of them even hire musicians to play some relaxing music while they take a dip. The warm water relaxes the body, and the soothing music relaxes the mind...\nPaimon: Whoa, that sounds so nice, Paimon wants to try it for herself...\n{NICKNAME}: Alright. Well, next time you visit the hot springs, I'll play some Aranara music for you.\nPaimon: Ooh~ ...Um, but Paimon doesn't play any instruments, so what happens when it's your turn to go in the spring?\n{NICKNAME}: You can sing me a song. Maybe... an opera from Fontaine?\nPaimon: That's way too hard! Also — not exactly relaxing! That kind of music will put your blood pressure through the roof!\nPaimon: How about some Natlan rap instead? Paimon's been practicing, check this out:\nPaimon: \"Hey! Flyin' in your face, it's Paimon the guide, no stranger to danger, takes it in her stride...\"\nPaimon: \"Saw a beast called blubber in the nation of water, my Guhua brother got his weapons in order, sword in one hand and a spear in the other...\"\n{NICKNAME}: Wow, very smooth!\n{NICKNAME}: If I was listening to that in a hot spring, I'd be tapping the water to the beat like a drum.\nPaimon: Yeah, it'd be like a big music festival! And anyone who's late to the party, the rhythm of the water would get them right into the groove!\n{NICKNAME}: Uhhh... Wait, didn't we start this by saying how the hot springs are meant to be relaxing?",
            "About the Collective of Plenty...\tPaimon: Don't you think those masked warriors look super cool?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, really gives them an air of mystery.\nPaimon: Right!? Don't you think Paimon should get in on this too? Put on a mask and win some wrestling matches with the Collective of Plenty? She could make a whole new name for herself!\nPaimon: Paimon's even thought of some catchphrases, get this: \"A Saurian warrior never removes her mask!\"\nPaimon: Famous adventurer by day, mighty Saurian warrior by night. Does that sound cool or what!?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, it does, but there's just one problem...\nPaimon: Hmm? What's that?\n{NICKNAME}: You'll just look like Paimon in a mask. No air of mystery there.",
            "About Woven Goods...\tPaimon: Here in Natlan, they seem to use woven scrolls where most nations would use books. It feels so different reading off of them.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. They say it started with the Masters of the Night-Wind, when the Shamans began recording their tribal history and legends on woven material. As the practice became more widely adopted, the number and variety of stories grew.\nPaimon: Ooh, Paimon should make a record of all our adventures as well! That way, if you ever start a tribe called the Travelers, you'll have your very own historical record!\nPaimon: Plus, it could make a really cool cape. And an extra blanket when you're camping in the wild...\n{NICKNAME}: That would make for one \"weathered\" chronicle.",
            "About the Collective of Plenty and the Flower-Feather Clan...\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that everyone from the Collective of Plenty is built like a bricklayer!\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe you should go stay with them for a while. Grow those muscles out.\nPaimon: No! Paimon likes herself the way she is now.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, then what about staying with the Flower-Feather Clan instead? Their thing is flying. I bet they could help you sharpen your skills!\nPaimon: Huh? But... isn't Paimon good enough at flying already?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, but then you'd be able to carry me when you fly.\nPaimon: Nope, not happening! How would that even be possible?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, if you had those muscles I talked about...\nPaimon: Oh, geez, not this again... For the last time, no!",
            "About Ways to Make Friends With Saurians...\tPaimon: Oooh, there are so many cute Saurians in Natlan! Paimon's gonna make friends with every single one!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh? Someone sounds confident...\nPaimon: You bet! Paimon's got it all figured out!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh you do, huh? Come on then, what's the secret to making Saurian friends?\nPaimon: It's really simple! First, you've gotta sweet-talk them, show 'em you mean well so they relax their defenses. Then, you gently pat them on the head — that makes them feel more comfortable around you.\nPaimon: Last but not least: Get 'em some good grub! The way to a Saurian's heart is through the stomach, after all! What do you think? Solid plan, huh?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, what do I think... I think that all of these tactics would also work really well on you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Would not! Paimon can't be won over by some cheap tricks!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? Oh, you misunderstand! I meant to say that you're as cute as a baby Saurian!\nPaimon: Hah! Flattery, really? You think that'll work on Paimon? Think again!\n{NICKNAME}: But I was being sincere, Paimon! Ah, how can I prove it to you? With some Sweet Madame, perhaps?\nPaimon: ...Wait, really? Sweet Madame? Oh, heck yes! Paimon could totally go for some of that right now!\nPaimon: ...Uhh... What's with that smug look on your face? ...What!? Is Paimon missing something?",
            "About Archaeology...\tPaimon: Word is that speed's of the essence when doing archaeology work with the Children of Echoes. Why's that?\n{NICKNAME}: It's probably because this place is absolutely overflowing with relics...\nPaimon: Uh, but isn't that a good thing?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, more relics means more competition! Imagine you saw a really cool stone slate one day, and planned to come back and grab it the day after — only to show up the next day and find someone else had already beaten you to it!\nPaimon: Um, Paimon still doesn't get it...\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, here's another analogy: Imagine one night you're all ready to dig in to a delicious snack... but then you find a piece of it's missing!\nPaimon: Ahh! Yeah, that'd be terrible!\nPaimon: ...Wait a sec, that's exactly what happened last night... Anything you wanna confess, {NICKNAME}?",
            "About Resolving Conflicts...\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that even in Natlan, there are lots of ways to resolve conflict that don't involve contests of strength.\n{NICKNAME}: Really? In the Nation of War?\nPaimon: Yeah! Like, apparently, some people in the Children of Echoes settle their disputes by holding a dance-off!\n{NICKNAME}: A dance-off? So, they mutually decide on a time and place...\nPaimon: Uh-huh!\n{NICKNAME}: And just dance their socks off?\nPaimon: Mm-hmm!\n{NICKNAME}: Until one person gets so exhausted, they can't get up anymore?\nPaimon: Yep!\nPaimon: ...Wait, what the... Hold on, that IS a contest of strength!",
            "About Ways to Make a Fortune...\tPaimon: Guess what? Paimon just thought of the best Mora-making idea ever!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh? Do tell.\nPaimon: Just look at how many people pass by this place every day. If we opened a business here, right outside the Stadium, we'd make a fortune without even trying!\n{NICKNAME}: So... What would you sell?\nPaimon: Uhhh... maybe... alchemical potions from Mondstadt?\n{NICKNAME}: I think there's already people selling similar stuff...\nPaimon: In that case, ummm... Ooh! Ores from Liyue! Yeah, we could make a killing off of those!\n{NICKNAME}: Pretty sure the Children of Echoes are already in that business, too...\nPaimon: Yeah... Wait, Paimon's got it — rugs from Sumeru! Those'll definitely be a hit!\n{NICKNAME}: Unfortunately, that's the specialty of the Masters of the Night-Wind.\nPaimon: Well then... we'll fence the whole Stadium up! And charge an admission fee to everyone who tries to get inside, whether they're a contestant or a spectator!\n{NICKNAME}: You'll be locked up before your fence is even half-finished...\nPaimon: Grrrrrrrr! Why does getting rich have to be so hard?",
            "About Saurian Stylists...\tPaimon: Paimon will never forget the first saurians we saw in Natlan. They're just fascinating creatures.\nPaimon: There was the Tepetlisaurs with their bouncy heads, the Koholasaurs with their smooth backs, and then the Yumkasaurs with their fluffy ears and heads.\n{NICKNAME}: I bet a baby Yumkasaur would make the best teddy bear...\nPaimon: Yeah... Hey, their fur probably keeps growing out as they get older, right? Do you think it starts getting in the way eventually?\nPaimon: Like, imagine if a Yumkasaur had really long fur around the ears and head... they'd barely be able to see where they're going. And that could be kinda dangerous...\n{NICKNAME}: You seem to have thought a lot about this. Are you planning on becoming a saurian hairstylist?\nPaimon: Uh... Are you serious?\n{NICKNAME}: Just think about it. Once you get famous, you'll be rolling in Mora!\nPaimon: Oh... You're right! This is it, this is how Paimon makes her fortune!\nPaimon: Paimon's gonna become the hairstylist for every Yumkasaur in Natlan! Hehehe, so much Mora...\nPaimon: No, wait, the Mora's secondary! The best part of this plan is making friends with all the Yumkasaurs! Life will be sooo happy!\n{NICKNAME}: But they're big, you know. It's gotta take a long time to style all that fur with just an ordinary pair of scissors. You might find you can only take one customer per day...\n{NICKNAME}: If you're serious about this stylist business, you'd better start building some strength! At the very least, aim to lift a pair of scissors as big as the Dull Blade!\nPaimon: The Dull Blade? But isn't that your weapon?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, but I can let you borrow it for training. Come on! Let's get practicing!\nPaimon:  Hey... This isn't \"training,\" this is \"give Paimon the sword and let her fight the monsters instead\"! Paimon did not sign up for this!",
            "About Ancient Names...\tPaimon: So in Natlan, warriors who impress the Wayob enough get an Ancient Name. Paimon's so jealous! Having an Ancient Name would be so cool!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? Don't you already have a bucket load of titles, Paimon?\nPaimon: Hmm? Oh wait... Yeah, you're right!\nPaimon: Paimon's your \"best travel companion\" and \"trusty guide,\" plus she's the \"Trendy Flyer,\" \"Silver Companion,\" and \"Assistant to the Honorary Senior Researcher\"... Heck yeah, Paimon's an actual legend!\nPaimon: If the people of Natlan end up making a record of our adventures, Paimon's gonna make sure they use every single one of those titles!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? But wouldn't that make everything too long?\n{NICKNAME}: Just think about it. If the locals also used all of their names, records would look something like:\n{NICKNAME}: On this day, \"Uthabiti\" Kachina of the Children of Echoes, otherwise known as the Nanatzcayans, and \"Umoja\" Mualani of the People of the Springs, of Meztli fame, encountered \"Malipo\" Kinich of the Scions of the Canopy of Huitztlan, traveling alongside his impish partner, K'uhul Ajaw, while on their way to the Masters of the Night-Wind in Mictlan...\nPaimon: Okay, okay, you can stop now! Geez, with a document that long, it'd stretch from here to the Stadium and back... and that's before it even got to the point!\nPaimon: Well, if Paimon had to pick just one out of all her titles... Yep, it'd have to be: \"Best companion ever\"!",
            "About the Stadium of the Sacred Flame...\tPaimon: So just between the two of us... Paimon's been wondering about something. It's to do with the competitions at the Stadium.\nPaimon: You know how there's a point system? First everyone fights in teams, then for the teams that make it through, there's a set number of one-on-one matches, and after that, everyone's ranked based on their final scores.\nPaimon: Why did they structure it like that?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe it's to maintain suspense until the final round? Everyone loves to see the underdog make a comeback at the last minute.\nPaimon: Could be, could be... Or maybe it's because they wanna avoid a situation where there's only two contestants and they're evenly matched?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah... They'd end up having to call it a draw and quit.\nPaimon: Exactly! It'd be like pitting the most aggressive Tatankasaur against the most slippery Yumkasaur. Tatankasaur attacks, Yumkasaur dodges, and so on and so forth, until a whole day and night has passed...\nPaimon: By this point, the audience is starving, so they end the fight and agree to a round two some other time.\nPaimon: But round two comes and goes, and there's still no clear winner. This time, the fight only ends because the Yumkasaur makes an illegal surprise attack and injures the Tatankasaur.\nPaimon: ...Before long, we've ended up with \"Tatanka vs. Yumka,\" \"Tatanka vs. Yumka 2,\" \"Tatanka vs. Yumka: Return of the Sacred Scales,\" \"Tatanka vs. Yumka: Over the Volcano\"... and the sequels show no signs of stopping.\nPaimon: ...Wait, we should totally get those made into a film series! We'd make a ton of Mora.\n{NICKNAME}: Not a bad idea... Although, I don't think the Scions of the Canopy would be too too happy about you making their Saurian the villain!\nPaimon: Alright, well you pitch an idea then, if you're such a film critic!",
            "About Natlan's Adventurers...\tPaimon: The Natlanese don't seem to leave Natlan much, do they?\n{NICKNAME}: Nope, and there are some good reasons for that.\nPaimon: Hmm... That must make things pretty difficult for anyone who wants to be an adventurer, huh?\nPaimon: Think about it — if they can't go to other nations, they miss out on a ton of potential commissions. If they can't go exploring unknown ruins, surely they can't make a whole lot of Mora... It's too bad.\n{NICKNAME}: You'd think so, wouldn't you? But in fact, they've found ways around it.\nPaimon: Huh?\n{NICKNAME}: I've heard of a group in the People of the Springs who call themselves \"wayfinders.\" They have a wealth of knowledge about Natlan's geography and ancient ruins, so a lot of foreign adventurers hire them as guides when they visit.\n{NICKNAME}: Of course, that means they get paid for each trip, regardless of whether their client actually finds the treasure. So in the long run, they might actually earn more than a traditional adventurer would.\nPaimon: Wow, okay... But wait — if they know so much about Natlan's ancient ruins, why don't they just go find the treasure themselves?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, here's the thing... What if there never was any treasure to begin with?\nPaimon: Whoa... Okay, Paimon's gonna need a minute to let that sink in...",
            "About Graffiti...\tPaimon: The Natlanese seem to do a lot of doodling everywhere. Except they don't call it \"doodling,\" do they? They call it, uh... flow-something?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Phlogiston engraving.\" But strictly speaking, that refers to the engraving of special stone tablets. What you're talking about is just regular graffiti.\n{NICKNAME}: Take this one, for example. It basically just says, \"You're in Nanatzcayan territory now! Children of Echoes for the win!\"\nPaimon: That's pretty fun! Now Paimon wants in. Shall we do some graffiti of our own?\n{NICKNAME}: We sure can. But what do you think we should draw?\nPaimon: Well that's easy — a portrait of the best travel guide in all of Teyvat! Now let's see... Ah, there! Put it right there on that cliff face.\n{NICKNAME}: So you want me to do the honors, huh? Alright then, lemme think about this... Yep, first we need to capture that classic Paimon facial expression: seething with rage...\nPaimon: Mhm-hmm— Wait, what!? Grr... You know what, forget it! Paimon has decided to find a professional Natlanese graffiti artist instead!",
            "About Saurian Companions...\t{NICKNAME}: The Natlanese seem to have a genuinely close relationship with their saurians.\nPaimon: Yeah! They're true companions, just like us. Inseparable wherever they go!\n{NICKNAME}: So... let's say there was a competition between you and the saurians. Who do you think would win the title of champion companion?\nPaimon: Huh? What sort of a question is that!?\n{NICKNAME}: I mean, the more I think about it, it's like... You can't burrow into the ground like the tepetlisaurs, and you don't fly as fast as the qucusaurs...\nPaimon: H—Hey! Y—You're thinking about this all wrong! For starters, Paimon flies way faster than any tepetlisaur, and she's better than the qucusaurs at, uh... at picking out the tastiest Chicken-Mushroom Skewer from the grill!\n{NICKNAME}: And most importantly of all, Paimon has been at my side longer than any saurian.\nPaimon: Exactly! Let's not forget who's the best travel guide in all of Teyvat, hehe!\n{NICKNAME}: Alright, my trusty companion, shall we set off on our next adventure?\nPaimon: Um, actually, now that Paimon's mentioned it, she feels like her Chicken-Mushroom-Skewer-picking-out skills have gotten a little rusty... C'mon, you should cook up a few so Paimon can practice!",
            "About Ajaw...\tPaimon: Paimon's been dying to hear your thoughts about this... What is the deal with Ajaw? And don't say you haven't noticed.\n{NICKNAME}: Noticed what?\nPaimon: ...! Try everything! He's completely different from every other Saurian! For starters, he can talk — matter of fact, he never shuts up! Also, he's always hovering around Kinich instead of walking on the ground. Oh, and don't get Paimon started on those stupid sunglasses! Why would a Saurian wear sunglasses? It doesn't make any sense!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm...\nPaimon: Why are you looking at Paimon like that...?\n{NICKNAME}: It's just... You talk a lot too, and you fly, plus... didn't you get yourself a pair of silly-looking glasses in Fontaine?\nPaimon: ...That is completely different!\nPaimon: But anyway, there's a more glaring issue here... Ajaw is flat as a pancake! He's floating around looking like a little cardboard cutout, and no one in Natlan bats an eyelid! Don't you think that's strange?\n{NICKNAME}: It's definitely unusual. Then again, maybe everyone's just used to it by now.\n{NICKNAME}: Ultimately, it nobody's business but Ajaw's, so if you want answers, you'd probably have to ask him.\nPaimon: But would he even tell us the truth? Paimon gets the feeling he'd just make up a bunch of phony-baloney to get us off his case...\nPaimon: *gasp* Or maybe... He'd be like, \"Okay, if you really wanna know... I'll show you!\" And then poof! He'd turn us into cardboard cutouts too!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... Cardboard-cutout Paimon, now that I would love to see, hehehe...\nPaimon: Hey... Cut it out! Paimon doesn't wanna be flat as a pancake...",
            "About Natlan's Body Painting Practices...\tPaimon: Have you noticed the... makeup that Natlanese people wear? Or body paint, or tattoos, or graffiti, or whatever it's called — anyway, it looks really cool!\n{NICKNAME}: I have noticed! \"Body paint\" is right, although it's not just any old paint. Apparently, it contains phlogiston.\nPaimon: Wow, really?\n{NICKNAME}: Yep. If you're interested to try it out, I'm pretty sure they offer a body painting experience specially for tourists — but they just use normal paint for that.\nPaimon: Ooh! Well, since we're here... why don't we try it? All part of the experience.\n{NICKNAME}: Sure thing. You'll need to pick a color palette and a motif first though. Each tribe has its own style.\nPaimon: Alright, Paimon chooses, uh... Paimon chooses... Ugh! They all look so cool! Choosing between them is impossible.\nPaimon: Meh, choosing is losing! Paimon will take them all!\n{NICKNAME}: Wow... Today I learned that Paimon is a maximalist... Well, I'm sure some people would say \"less is more,\" but I say — you do you, Paimon!\nPaimon: What are you talking about!? Paimon never said anything about using them all at once! She just wants options, so she can switch up her style every day!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Oh. That's too bad... I woulda loved to see Paimon with an elaborate arm-tattoo...\nPaimon: Stop! Nope! Stop it! No imagining Paimon with an arm-tattoo! Not allowed!",
            "About Living With Saurians...\tPaimon: The people and saurians of Natlan have a great relationship, huh? They live together, fight together, even fly together...\n{NICKNAME}: Just like us, right? Except you're too small to take me flying... It's just a shame you can't grow any bigger. Not for want of trying, of course — you do eat a lot of Chicken-Mushroom Skewers...\nPaimon: Hmph... Let's not forget that saurians can't be your guide. Or your conversation partner.\n{NICKNAME}: It's strange to think that there was once a time when humans and saurians were enemies. And now they co-exist peacefully. Must've taken a lot of work to get to where things are today.\nPaimon: If Paimon was a saurian, all it would have taken is some tasty food.\n{NICKNAME}: You say that, but... what if you demanded a hundred chicken skewers per day, and the humans couldn't provide that much?\nPaimon: Umm... Paimon could probably settle for fifty a day...\n{NICKNAME}: Or even better — maybe the humans could team up with you and you could go hunting together. Then there'd be enough meat for everyone to eat their fill!\nPaimon: Uh-huh! Peace between species all starts with a full stomach!",
            "About the Volcano...\tPaimon: That Volcano is so huge, you can see it from anywhere in Natlan... Where do you think all that magma comes from, though?\n{NICKNAME}: One legend holds that an enormous Pyro Dragon slumbers in the deepest depths of Natlan. Within the dragon's body dwells the world's first flame, burning eternally, and causing boils to form on the dragon's back. Every once in a while, these boils spew out fire, which takes the form of magma when it comes above ground.\nPaimon: For real!? But... what happens if the dragon ever wakes up? Natlan will be doomed!\n{NICKNAME}: Yep, and that's why the Pyro Archon gets the tribes to periodically join forces and go pacify the dragon, to make sure it stays asleep.\nPaimon： ...Wait, what? No, that's to fight the Abyss! Isn't it?\n{NICKNAME}： ...Well, not if this story from a woven scroll I bought on the street is to be believed.\nPaimon： Ugh, Paimon knew it!"

            "Character Details\tAn unknown bard that came from nowhere. He sometimes sings outdated songs, other times he hums new ones that none have ever heard of.\nHe likes apples and lively atmospheres, but hates cheese and anything that is slimy.\nWhen channeling Anemo, it appears in the form of feathers, because he likes things that look light.",
            "Character Story 1\tBack when traveling bard Venti had only been in Mondstadt for a few months, his income was far less than the other more established bards in town. But once he had a few Mora in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time — one of the city's taverns.\nUnfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.\nThe first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: \"I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here...\" Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...\nThe strategy he developed was drinking on the job — that is to say, playing the lyre while holding a wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performances instead of giving him Mora.\nThe novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.\nThere was just one snag — he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...\nAnd if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.\nVenti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.\nEasier said than done — the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere is a towering oak tree at the center of Windrise, said to have sprouted when Vennessa ascended to the heavens a millennium ago.\nIn the past few months, travelers resting in the shade of the great oak sometimes hear a young boy singing the tales of Barbatos, the Anemo Archon.\nUnlike the ruling deities of the other nations, Barbatos has long left Mondstadt. In fact, the only visible proof of his connection with Mondstadt is the Statues of The Seven that appear across the land — even then, the resemblance is vague at best. Fortunately, Barbatos's past deeds are recorded in books and epics, sung and passed on by the bards.\nIn contrast to these more canonical works, Venti's ballads tend to include bizarre adventures and acts of mischief, such as the time that Barbatos pinched the Cryo Archon's scepter and replaced it with a hilichurl's wooden club...\nWorshippers of Barbatos are quick to decry these frivolous tales as blasphemous fabrications. But whenever someone confronts Venti about this, his response suggests that he has not an ounce of remorse.\n\"How can you know that they're fabrications?\"\nHe has a point — even the most devoted sister could not possibly know the details of all of Barbatos's deeds from a millennium ago.\nOnly Venti knows the truth behind his song lyrics, and it is a truth he hides behind an enigmatic smile.\nReason being, yes — Venti's tall tales of Barbatos's unorthodox exploits are entirely fabricated.\nHey, Venti finds that a few drinks really gets his muse going. Can you really blame him?",
            "Character Story 3\tAround 2,600 years ago, the Archon War had yet to end, and the world had yet to fall under the dominion of The Seven.\nIn those days, the city called \"Mondstadt\" was surrounded on all sides by gales impenetrable even to the birds of the air. The wind's ceaseless howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.\nThe Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.\nIn those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.\nHe who would in latter days be known as \"Barbatos\" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.\nIn Mondstadt of old, Venti met a young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all.\n\"I do so wish to see the birds in flight.\"\nSo said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.\n\"Friend, will you not come along?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tThe elemental being Venti obtained the feather of an eagle for the lad living in that storm-shrouded city, who had never seen a bird in his life.\nThen, war broke out in Mondstadt, in the name of freedom.\nWith the feather tucked away in his breast pocket, Venti watched the fall of the eccentric ruler amid the wrack and ruin of revolt together with his friend.\nThe ruler had believed that he had given his subjects a city free from the bitter cold, and to the end, he believed that they had loved him as he loved them.\nYet, despite the victory, Venti was never able to give that feather to the lad, for that lad had fallen in the battle for the sake of song, sky, and birds, and for the people who, like him, had dwelled within the storm-wall.\nWith the crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity, a new god was born. The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.\nHis first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.\nFor only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.\nPlucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.\nHe bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.\nIn future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city.\n\"Surely, he too would have wanted to live in such a place.\"\nThus, a new age began for Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe Anemo Archon cannot take credit for everything in Mondstadt.\nCredit should be given where credit is due, I shall sing now the praises of things beauteous and true:\nWe thank the West Wind, whose enduring caress\nBrings the blossoms of Spring, by whose scent we are blessed.\n\nFinches, ducks, rabbits and boars,\nMondstadt's revival bid them thrive evermore.\nIn summer the lion walks the plains,\nNo words one finds to praise it but these:\nDo you sweat out your water to make way for wine?\nComes the heat of the summer from your mane of sunshine?\n\nThe mountain mouths and gorges low like drunkards wayward lie...\nBut the East Wind cares not, for it doesn't walk — it flies!\nOver the fruit trees it brushes low,\nAnd its wings bring the harvest of things that grow.\n\nThe North Wind in the silent forest slumbers,\nAnd around it pace the wolves in their numbers.\nThough most have never a glimpse of them seen, for the Wind knows that none is of winter too keen,\nYet the Anemo Archon glimpses and sees, that it dreams each night of warm reverie.\n\n—As the four seasons in turn shall say their piece, so the four winds too shall never cease.\nOf course, to look at it differently, I am the one who should be credited here, and not they.\nCredits should be given where credits belong — if not for the bard who pens the song, then who shall ensure that these tales are passed on?",
            "Where the Wind Doth Not Blow\tAfter 1,600 years of history, Mondstadt's \"freedom\" had sunk to a heretofore unseen low.\nBarbatos, unwilling to become a tyrant, had departed. But he had never imagined that those to whom he had gifted freedom would make for themselves a tyrant.\nThe aristocracy ruled Mondstadt with a cruel hand, bringing slaves into this land and ignoring the cries of the oppressed.\nThus the Anemo Archon returned after these 1,600 years to what was once the City of Freedom. He heard the cry of the slave girl Vennessa, and together with her raised a rebellion that overthrew the aristocracy.\n—Now, the above is what all know to be the official history of Mondstadt.\nThe story has an interesting, little-known twist, however.\nThe one who united the people of Mondstadt in this conflict was indeed the hero Vennessa — but that which caused many of the aristocracy's troops to turn coat was a \"treachery against the wind.\"\nA secret treaty was found, a betrayal of the city — the aristocrats had forsaken the wind, and sold everything in Mondstadt to the Geo Archon of the neighboring land.\nAt the treaty's end was carved an insignia inimitable by all save the deity so named: Rex Lapis.\nHow the soldiers that had once oppressed the slaves shuddered when they saw that they too would become slaves in a foreign land.\nThe news, and the conflict, spread like wildfire, consuming the aristocracy. It was only many years later that historians would discover that this treaty was fake.\nAs it turned out, Venti had once practiced the art of forgery in order to play pranks on the Geo Archon, but could never deceive the god of wealth and transactions. Even so, his adeptness would come into play after several hundred years.\nWhat a happy coincidence.",
            "Vision\tThe Seven Archons do not need Visions, for they already have great power.\nYet Barbatos was fond of the mortal world, and wanted to roam Mondstadt more freely as \"Venti.\" As such, he constructed a glass ornament very much like the Visions worn by those chosen by the gods.\nThe imitation has no special abilities, nor does Venti rely on it to channel elemental power.\nHowever, since Venti does not keep the Holy Lyre der Himmel by his side, and since he is too lazy to bring a normal lyre, he gave his fake Vision the ability to turn into the wooden lyre \"Der Frühling.\""

            "Character Story 1\tMany years ago, the Wanderer was not called by that title. Indeed, he has had many, all of which corresponded to a special status he possessed at that time. Today, many of these past affairs have been forgotten.\nThe puppet, the eccentric Kabukimono, the 6th seat of the Fatui Harbingers, The Balladeer...\nEach of these was a thread of fate tying the puppet's joints down.\nAny recollection must begin several hundred years ago, when the puppet that shed tears upon being born would not be given a name, but was instead only given a small golden feather as proof of his personage.\nHe would be laid to rest within the Shakkei Pavilion, staring blankly at the beauteous scenery within. The flaming maple leaves, the exquisite window lattices... Within that lovely prison, he lost all perception.\nIt was by accident that a kind-hearted samurai named Katsuragi would enter the pavilion and rescue him. It was Katsuragi who brought him to live in Tatarasuna and meet the people who lived there.\nThen, the puppet was as naive as a newborn, filled with goodwill and gratitude towards humans. Katsuragi, upon seeing the golden pinion on his person, knew that this puppet must not have been of ordinary stock, yet have his reasons not to mention his place of origin. Thus, he omitted all mention of Shakkei Pavilion, instead claiming falsely that he had found the young man while patroling Nazuchi Beach, and he bade the puppet play along so as to not expose the lie.\nBusy, bustling Tatarasuna was a place of many happy memories for the puppet. There, he was briefly human. There, he was briefly normal.\nKatsuragi, Mikoshi Nagamasa, Niwa, Miyazaki, and many other now-forgotten people from Tatarasuna would teach him to read and write, to start fires and make meals, to forge — yes, they accepted him as their friend.\nThey even asked him: \"Don't you want a name? Or are you going to let everyone out there call you the Kabukimono?\"\nYet he had no dislike for this name.\n\"Kabukimono\" referred mostly to those who wore vibrant colors and behaved in a peculiar manner. Yes, they made him different, but such was proof of his humanity — proof that he belonged in Tatarasuna.\nPity, then, that though he loved this name so, he would be forced to forsake it. For when he no longer wished to become human, it lost its meaning.\nHe would depart, and after arriving in the distant north, would join the wild banquet of the Harbingers, working to win the sixth seat among them.\nIt was the Tsaritsa who would grant him his new title — \"The Balladeer.\" Strength, power, and the desire for conflict — these he already possessed.\nThe chess pieces raised tides of madness amidst battle, and the slaughterers on the stage upended order.\nIn that moment, he was sure that The Balladeer was his true name.",
            "Character Story 2\tIn the early days when Tatarasuna was still a prosperous place, the Wanderer walked amongst its people, going by the name \"Kabukimono.\"\nAnd the thing that ended his peaceful life was not all that important in the grand scale of Inazuma's history.\nChange came to the place in the form of the Akame Clan and a mechanic from Fontaine named Escher. The two cooperated very closely to further improve forging quality, and in the process, Akame introduced Escher to Niwa, who was also from the three Isshin traditions.\nEscher's arrival caused quite the stir for a time, for it was through his revolutionary new techniques that they were able to process Crystal Marrow in such a way that their forging efficacy and production were both increased.\nBut as time passed, anomalies emerged within the great central furnace in Tatarasuna. Black gas gathered within the furnace, and it would gradually affect the bodies of the craftspeople there. Forging and smelting were the foundations of life in Tatarasuna, but now they had become death itself.\nAnd as the toll mounted, the great furnace further went out of control. None could get close to its core, and even stopping it became nigh impossible.\nAs the highest authority at Tatarasuna, Niwa was forced to enact an information blackout while sending people to Inazuma City to beg aid from Tenshukaku.\nFor some reason, however, those who took to the sea in ships never returned. Horror began seeping into the hearts of Tatarasuna's people.\nThe Kabukimono knew that Niwa needed the Raiden Shogun's aid, but did not know that this was the very year when she had successfully built the perfect puppet using parts of herself as material, thus handing over management of the nation to the Guardian of Eternity. He thus boarded a small boat and braved storm and rain to arrive at Tenshukaku, seeking an audience with the Shogun.\nBut she now dwelled in the Plane of Euthymia, and he was repeatedly refused. In desperation, he displayed the golden feather on his person and asked to see Yae Miko instead.\nAt this time, Miko was busy assisting the Guardian, and though she rushed down as soon as she heard this news, she could only meet the distressed Kabukimono briefly. Yet he had no ears for her promises to send people to their aid immediately, and returned in despair, convinced that the Shogunate had forsaken Tatarasuna.\nStill, the dispatch was sent, the people were mobilized, and they crossed by sea. Yet they arrived to no great disaster. Indeed, most people knew nothing of what had happened. It was the mechanic, Escher, who explained that Niwa had fled with his family for fear of punishment for his malfeasance, and that the Kabukimono had gone into the core zone in his place, shutting the furnace down.\nReceiving word that the Kabukimono had been friends with the fleeing Niwa, Yae guessed at the heaviness in his heart and did not wish to further disturb him, merely sending someone to return the feather to him.\nLater still, he would disappear without a trace from Tatarasuna. But as people reminisced, they could never forget the celebratory dance he had performed together with them on the day that Mikoshi Nagamasa successfully forged his great blade.\nHis steps fluttered lightly like a feather in the wind then, and they could not have known that he, like a feather, would depart from them and journey to places unknown.",
            "Character Story 3\tAfter leaving Tatarasuna, the Kabukimono met a young child in a small house by the seaside somewhere in Inazuma.\nThe young boy was weak and sickly, and he lived in a rickety old place into which the rain leaked. Seeing his constantly mud-caked face through the gaps in the decrepit wooden door, the Kabukimono felt something twist in his heart, as if some ancient feeling was being re-awakened. And so, he stayed within that wooden house to care for that sick boy, bringing him melons, fruits, and water to drink, helping him to wipe the filth from his face.\nMany days passed, and the child's parents did not return. It was only later that the Kabukimono learned that the parents were also workers from Tatarasuna, and they might have lived normal and happy lives, if not for husband and wife contracting some strange illness during their work, often coughing up blood as a result. That they had not returned indicated that they may have passed without any fanfare in some place out there.\nThe child's name was unimportant, for he had another identity: he was the Kabukimono's friend, and family besides. They talked about how they had been born and promised to continue to live together in that ramshackle hut. As proof of their friendship, the Kabukimono took the boy to Shakkei Pavilion to see the place where he had once lived.\nThe flaming maple leaves, the ancient latticed windows... All was as it had once been.\nAt that time, he believed that he would never return here... but he did not realize that the child could die in only one night. One night, barely enough time for the Kabukimono to go out and find some food or swipe some furniture that others no longer had any use for.\nThough he had already witnessed much change, he never knew that another person's passing was something that could occur in such a brief moment, or that this moment could grant him nothing but pain.\nAfter the shock, he felt incomparable fury. He was alone. Again. Was he not once more abandoned?\nAgain! Again! Again!\nThe boy's small body on the ground was curled up like a jumble of flower petals, a corner of it stained red with blood — red like the maple leaves... red like a blazing fire.\nThat night, a great flaming glow lit the seaside. The Kabukimono burned the wooden house, and finding himself an old straw hat from within it, left to begin his long journey.\nHe wandered everywhere, not knowing where to go, and though he would meet many more people along the way, he would never again regard any of them as his companions.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe sixth of Snezhnaya's Fatui Harbingers is known as The Balladeer.\nAnd yet this name was not his to own from the start. Indeed, they were yet separated by over a hundred years.\nAfter leaving Inazuma, he forsook the name Kabukimono, reverting to his nameless state, and did not even consider taking another until The Jester found him.\nIn the end, such titles as \"puppet\" or \"Kabukimono\" were all given to him by mortals. And since he would no longer have them as companions, there was no point in using the names they gave him.\nBut The Jester proved most persuasive, and the puppet was intrigued by the frenzied banquet he spoke of, and so accompanied the man to Snezhnaya to serve in the Fatui.\nA stranger named The Doctor would welcome him warmly in this frigid northern land, inviting the Wanderer to be the key reference material in his experiments — his grand research project.\nPuppet-making techniques had their roots in Khaenri'ah, and his nature as a creation of the Electro Archon made him all the more special. The Doctor was fascinated by this field of study, and, using the Wanderer as a foundational blueprint, would perform research and experiments for several decades before finally attaining the techniques that would go on to form the basis for his Segments.\nIn return, The Doctor would unlock the seal on his body, causing his abilities to greatly increase, to the point where he was a match for the lower-ranked Harbingers.\nBut even so, he did not choose another name. His colleagues called him the \"puppet,\" and so he saw himself also — a puppet, unafraid of death and inexhaustible.\nOn the Tsaritsa's orders, he would lead a company to explore the Abyss, and there he spent much time. More than once he was wounded, then repaired by The Doctor, and thus he grew stronger, surviving to be wounded again by ever mightier foes.\nMuch later, he would bring the results of his exploration back to Snezhnaya, gaining the sixth seat in the process. His orders were also changed. Instead of exploring the Abyss, he was now to constantly be on standby, assisting the clandestine activities of the Fatui across the world.\nAnd it was only then that he felt that that new name, \"The Balladeer,\" fit him.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe many things that happened after that might even be called soul-stirring, but for the fact that few now remember them.\nOnly those who witnessed those events would keep them as legends in their hearts, and so they continue to quietly exist, as ancient songs lost to the world.\nWithin Irminsul, The Balladeer came into contact with the \"truth\" that Lesser Lord Kusanali had placed within the flow of information. This secret had been hidden within one of The Doctor's many hearts, and just as she claimed, this truth in first person contained all his remaining honesty.\nAnd thus did The Balladeer come to know of past truths: Niwa, who had taught him how to live like an ordinary human and treated him like one, had not fled Tatarasuna to escape punishment as Escher had claimed. In fact, the true culprit had been Escher — no, The Doctor — all along. And as for the heart that had been placed within The Balladeer, it had been cut, still warm, from Niwa's breast.\nThis death had been nicely packaged within an incident at the forge, and such was Escher's silvered tongue that he all too quickly convinced everyone that this was due to the failings of the local overseer.\nAs the next person in charge, Mikoshi Nagamasa would have faced capital punishment if not for the intervention of his loyal samurai retainer, Katsuragi, who willingly took the burden of wrongdoing upon himself.\nThe tragedy that followed need not be elaborated upon. Nagamasa, unwilling as he was, had to wash the stain from the Mikoshi name, and could not allow himself to die here.\nAnd so he brought forth his beloved blade, the Daitatara Nagamasa, and struck Katsuragi down in a single blow, the blade cutting so deep that it nearly split the slain man in twain...\n...And had they not all believed in their god?\nWhy then, did they have to face such a calamity?\nIf the enigmatic puppet they called the Kabukimono had never existed, would Escher have done the same thing there?\nEven if the chance were infinitesimal, could the tragedy of Tatarasuna have been salvaged?\nAnyone anywhere else in this world would be able to do nothing about this, but not The Balladeer. He knew that he alone could attempt this one thing, here and now.\nHe believed himself bold, for he feared not death. Death was but a tiny threat to a puppet, and only humans with hearts knew horror.\nHe also knew himself to be craven, and for that he had remorse. If he had been then more like he was at present... if he had learned to be less trusting... Would those he had viewed as friends have met such a ruinous end?\nTraitor, hero, god, discarded detritus — all these identities would cease to matter to one who leaped into the flux.\nThe information flow was a place of incomparable silence, and yet his blood roiled in his ears, and his mind roared.\nEmbrace oblivion!\nThe puppet was a discarded milksop, the Kabukimono unaccomplished and sheltered, and Scaramouche was a schemer — one who eventually went against divine decree, seeking to go against the tides of the world.\nBut what of it?\nOnce upon a time, these inhuman hands had shut a great blazing furnace without caring if his ten fingers were burned to a crisp.\nNow, these hands grasped at the tiniest possibility, twisting the truth to fulfill his wish.\nYes, embrace it, embrace it with this form that shall be obliterated!\nTo ruin with this life, as worthless as flowers and feathers and the dawn dew!\nFarewell, world! The future shall be what it will. Farewell nonetheless!",
            "Tiny Doll\tHaving decided to stop by Sumeru, the Wanderer took some time off to visit Treasures Street and learn how to make toys from some of the merchants there.\nIn a corner of the bustling street, a kind-hearted old fellow with hair as white as snow invited him to sit by his side, teaching him how to use cloth and thread to sew that which he wanted to make step by step.\nThe Wanderer spent much time practicing, doing this thing that did not agree with his personality. Strange, perhaps, but he did not hate it.\nHe had done such things with great patience in times past, after all, learning things such as holding cutlery, wearing clothes, combing his hair...\nYes, he had learned to be a \"human\" from the little things up.\nA few days later, his great work was complete — a little man with white clothes and black hair, a waistband tied using a butterfly knot, and a clear, round tear at the corner of his eye.\nIndeed, back then, there was a young fellow who had made this doll in imitation of the Wanderer's past appearance. Shame, then, that he had burned both the doll and his old home to ashes when he left Inazuma.\nMany years later, he would make one as well, and oh, how familiar that felt!\nSmall and soft as it was, it was akin to a defenseless babe. It took up little space in his sleeves, and if he kept it in his hat, it felt like having a travel companion.\n\"From today, you shall wander together with me.\"\nHe said softly, placing it in his pocket.",
            "Vision\tIn that instant, the Wanderer could hear the wind's voice. He knew not whence it had come, only that it changed direction as if to greet him.\nOn it were scents old and nostalgic — the iron hammer, metals, the furnace, the dust of the earth...\nDistant dreams, a prosperous past... Incredible though it might seem, even he once led such a simple life.\nIn that instant, he beheld his own reflections, each one vivid, each one real, each one him.\nCowering in fear, pathetic in his agony, arrogant yet laughable... And they all coalesced into one body.\nTo accept the past is to acknowledge its failings, to recognize that one is naught but a coward who has achieved nothing — who has nothing.\nBut only by doing so could he break free of his shackles and become, once again, that tragic person.\nIn that moment, he knew this: that the appearances of peace and beauty were but an illusion. The real him had never died, no, it lived on deep within his heart. As long as he still had a choice, he would tread the same course no matter how many times he did this over.\nAs he moved like lightning itself, a blazing light came between him and the Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom, blocking its attack. His will and his choice had gained him the eye of the gods.\nThe Vision descended, and caught between bright light and darkness, the glittering ornament seemed almost like an eye on a smiling face, questioning him from afar: Can you, who have desires of such intensity, still be considered a being without a heart?"

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tTo the great relief of the Maison Ordalie, most Fontainians are law-abiding citizens. As such, the Fortress of Meropide is not a place that they will ever visit in their lives.\nAt the same time, there is an easily understood yet rather tragic truth, which is that those who have served time often find it difficult to reintegrate back into the \"overworld,\" and few will actively speak of their experiences in the \"underworld.\"\nRather than a specific place, the Fortress is more like an idea, a warning, a symbol of misfortune and castigation — a byword amongst Fontainians. As for who controls this idea, that is unimportant.\nThanks to this state of affairs, Wriothesley has been able to lead a secluded and private existence, living and traveling in Fontaine in a manner quite unbefitting of his status as the \"Duke.\"\nIndeed, even as pedestrians are saying things like \"fool around any further, and I'll punch you straight into the Fortress of Meropide,\" or \"this job is garbage, I'd rather be tightening screws at the bottom of the sea,\" this administrator of said underwater fortress might be walking the same stone-paved road to the café, on his way to grab some takeout for his afternoon tea.",
            "Character Story 1\tWriothesley does not, in fact, leave the Fortress often. Using the network of information and connections that he has personally built up over the years, he can gain any intelligence or resources he needs from the comfort of his office.\nHowever, he is also aware of one principle, which is that he cannot be imprisoned in that office by the host of duties that assails him, or he will either never get a good night’s sleep, or soon find himself sleeping forever beneath the waves.\nOnly two things are necessary for him to run this place comfortably: Mora and manpower.\nFortunately, the Fortress itself is a giant factory, and he has quite the knack for making money — why, even the Palais Mermonia is one of his valued customers. Very importantly, giving the Palais some extra care is not considered to be hankering after power, and the Court of Fontaine for its part has little power of oversight over the Fortress, and thus simply represents valued customers and Mora — the more of both, the better. As such, Wriothesley is happy to comply with the Maison Gestion’s exhaustively strict demands for proper documentation.\n(The Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering's incredible demand for Arkhium might have once made it a match for the Palais, but ever since the Institute became a mid-air tourist attraction, it has been forced to withdraw from the partnership. Till we meet again for another big contract, valued customer.)\nOne of the most common pitfalls for the immensely wealthy is over-valuing money and undervaluing people. This is, again, where Wriothesley is a fortunate man, for he was not born rich, and thus knows how important it is to get along with others.\nHe treats all who live at the Fortress equally. Be they criminals, guards, or ordinary staff, so long as they do what they should as they should, he will not nitpick.\nBut as for those who overstep their station — well then, words must be had. The underwater space they dwell in is quite enclosed, and for most, there is nowhere else to go. If possible, of course, Wriothesley would prefer everyone to be reasonable, but where reasoned words fail, he will use even more persuasive means.\nOccasionally overlooking the trivial, meaningless, but inevitable clashes between people is fair enough. Most people know better than to raise a real stink, while as for those who don’t... there are places where they can go. Just as flowing water can cleanse itself, so can a functioning society get rid of its rot.\nAs such, not only has Wriothesley not been worked into oblivion, he has even found himself significant amounts of free time.\nOnce, the famous Champion Duelist Clorinde paid him a visit, and said this in passing: \"Why does it feel like you have even more free time than me? Your title wasn’t bought, was it?\"\n\"One moment, please.\"\nSo saying, Wriothesley rifled through three drawers before producing several thick documents with a flourish. \"Now, let me see... 'excellent management'... 'leading tax contributor'... 'specially granted this title...' Well, what do you know? Good guess, that's pretty much what happened after all.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tNo titles may be bought in Fontaine, which prides itself upon impartial justice — certainly not with Mora. That idle exchange between Wriothesley and Clorinde was pure nonsense, just a bit of verbal horsing around to liven up an otherwise bone-dry business interaction.\nHowever, while the title of \"Duke\" itself was not bought, Wriothesley's accession to administrator of the Fortress of Meropide cannot be separated from \"money.\"\nCredit Coupons serve the role of currency within the Fortress. Here, Coupons are the medium of exchange, and this has been the case for a very long time, with only the details differing. When Wriothesley was incarcerated here as an inmate, trade in Coupons was much freer, and the range of items that could be bought more comprehensive. So long as you had enough of them in your pocket, you could obtain harmful drugs, know the winner of fixed matches, buy the hearts of people sitting on the fence, and even take away the right of others to continue breathing.\nMany of these were extralegal trades, but even the official channels had their various special tricks, too. If you lacked private connections, you could only buy food and water at exorbitant prices, and your fortune slip would not be some adage of unknown providence, but real, practical, extra work you had to finish by the end of the workday. Coupons in those days resembled nothing so much as the previous administrator's tool for controlling inmates.\nHurling lawbreakers into a lawless chaos to fend for themselves was indeed one way of doing things, but Wriothesley could not approve of it. He was perfectly willing to adapt to his environment, but if the environment was not suited for survival in the first place, then he certainly wasn't going to take this lying down.\nHe spent a great deal of time accumulating capital in the underground arena and used that money to make still more. He was always the observant type, and was quite persuasive, too, not to mention humble and reasonable — so before anyone knew it, he had already accumulated more Coupons than everyone else in the Fortress combined.\nThis accumulated wealth made him a man of high repute amongst his fellow inmates. And just as Wriothesley expected, the hammer of punishment soon came swinging down. In a single night, his Coupon account was emptied in one cruel stroke by the Fortress's administrator.\nBut as noted before, Wriothesley had a knack for convincing others. Words have the power to incite, and so long as all residents of the Fortress, rich and poor, understood that they could suffer a similar fate under such management, they would speak up for him. And if he acted in a sufficiently upright manner in a sufficiently impressive setting, others would join with him to fill the void in their hearts.\nAs such, he challenged the Fortress' previous administrator to a duel, in the name of fairness, justice, and order. Of course, their respective standings made poor grounds for this fight even at the best of times, but on that day, not a soul, inmate or guard, said a word in protest.\nVery fortunately, said administrator's last-minute flight saved Wriothesley from having to get another person’s blood on his hands. But unfortunately, that day was also the day he would have finished serving his sentence, but with the administrator missing, there was no one to sign his exit papers.\nAnd so, he walked into the office in the middle of the Fortress, and took over all relevant duties.",
            "Character Story 3\tAfter he obtained access to old court documents, Wriothesley pulled out his own case file. There wasn't much in it, but even that was already all that the Fontaine authorities had been able to uncover at the time. According to the accounting ledger of his host family, he had been taken in as an abandoned infant — beyond that, there was no more relevant information.\nWhile browsing through his file, Wriothesley encountered some names that he had vague impressions of, and some other foggy faces briefly floated into view before fading to the sound of turning pages. Had he been willing, he could have used his connections to discover how these old companions were faring, but he dismissed those thoughts even as they entered his mind.\nTo them, he must represent a past they no longer wished to recall, and to him, these names no longer constituted any part of his life. He had a new identity, a new home, and new friends.\nThis was a strange experience for him. He'd met and known many people, and of all of them, very few could be considered friends — and he even knew quite a few who weren't human at all, something he puts down to Melusines really enjoying hanging out with humans. Their appearance belies their age, but the goodwill they show humans truly does have an innocence that only one's elders may have, a belief that these young human souls are good-hearted to begin with, and thus worthy of all care and faith in the infinite possibilities their futures hold.\nWriothesley himself has benefitted from this many times. When he was out on the streets with only the clothes on his back, it was a passing Melusine who gave him some hot soup. When he did not return completely unharmed from his bouts in the ring, Sigewinne would be waiting to greet him cheerily in the infirmary — not to mention how the officers of the Marechaussee Phantom have always been, within legal limits, his greatest help in investigating certain secret affairs.\nAs such, he tacitly permits their visits to the Fortress, even if this can sometimes mean unneeded trouble. As for anything they might need to know, the Head Nurse warns them, and there's no need to go into details. In any case, anyone so capable of pasting stickers everywhere while he's not looking is hardly someone whose well-being he needs to worry too much about.",
            "Character Story 4\tWatching the crimson stain spread across the floorboards, a wildly inappropriate thought entered Wriothesley's mind. How many Melusine officers would it take to investigate all the traces of blood in this place?\nHis thoughts then immediately leapt elsewhere. To think that his blood was so like that of those who had deceived him that they could run together, melding effortlessly. How revolting.\nBut he had lost all capacity to vomit. Indeed, he could not move a muscle if he tried. Thought and warmth had both faded, and his mind had begun to fill with a seeping, murky fog — there was nothing in his life till now worth remembering.\nBut he did not die. Fate, it seemed, wanted him to live with the burden of sin, and so when he woke up in his hospital bed, both of his hands had been cuffed to the metal rails. A well-dressed woman was looking at him nervously from her distant chair. No doubt, she considered him to be some manner of young psychopath.\nProducing pen and paper, she asked for his name, and he paused for a good long time. His thoughts drifted to an obituary he once saw in the papers, in which there was a person who had lived to a ripe old age bearing a long and complicated name. He didn't particularly like it, but he no longer wished to use the one his foster parents had given him.\nThus did the woman write \"Wriothesley\" down, and inform him of his trial date (which was, would you know it, the day the doctors expected him to be able to get out of bed), before hurriedly taking her leave.\nThe trial itself went very smoothly, which he was grateful for. The blood he had spilled had stained his hands and taken root in his heart, driving him to yearn for a just conviction. He told all present of the full circumstances around the killing, and even added some details, such that there was no real room for argument in this case. Argue they still did, though, first on the matter of past cases related to orphans in an inconclusive search for any precedent patterns, and then somehow for clemency, believing that the people he'd taken vengeance on were villains themselves in the first place, and that he should thus not have to bear the burden of guilt.\nThis background noise did not change the ultimate result of the trial, and no sooner was it over than he was sent beneath the sea to serve time. Before he was to depart, the Gestionnaire in charge of recording his sentence asked him once again for his personal particulars.\n\"You're... Wriothesley, then? Your birthday, please.\"\n\"...Today.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tWriothesley’s mechanical gauntlets have gone through a great many iterations.\nTheir origin can be traced back to his escape from his foster home. Given his age and constitution then, it was impossible for him to deal with a single adult, let alone more. As such, he was forced to try his luck on the streets, picking up odd jobs and doing apprenticeships, learning the art of lockpicking and the creation of small gadgets. He wanted to make sure that he would be well-equipped when he finally returned to destroy that accursed place.\nHe fashioned a wrist-mounted device that could launch iron nails at high speed, penetrating any sufficiently soft surface. Unfortunately, it had limited uses, and lost all ability to function after a battle, just like him — and unlike him, it could not be saved.\nIn the past, the underground pankration fights of the Fortress of Meropide had neither a fixed venue nor set rules. To win and keep earning, he had to constantly modify his gauntlets, because a trick you used once could be used against you the next time. Furthermore, even if he didn’t render them scrap on the field, they could still be stolen or wrecked in some other way by others. He certainly had to start over countless times.\nOnce he had the ability to garner better materials, his progress began to accelerate. He no longer needed to rely on chemicals to power the mechanism, and he would gain the support of professionals hailing from the Fontaine Research Institute. Those researchers enjoyed explaining the principles of mechanics to him even as they bellyached about all sorts of outrageous matters that occurred at the Institute. This, Wriothesley found fascinating — technological development increased the number of crimes that were committed, but they could also aid in solving them. Was that development then good or bad? That was hard to say.\nAt that point, he no longer participated in matches all that often, with the gauntlets being saved for dealing with the trickiest of problems. They no longer took life, and instead brought him great praise and respect.\nBut the people of the Fortress also know little of the crime he once committed. The only one who still remembers it like yesterday is Wriothesley himself. And no matter how much glory or repute he has earned, he still considers himself to be the same old Wriothesley he's always known.\nNeither a good person, nor a complete villain. He's just another soul, still living on in this world.",
            "The Wingalet\t\"But thusly do the ancient writers concur — 'Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.'\"\nAfter dealing with the spies that the Fatui planted, Wriothesley took a bit of a swim in the seas around the Fortress. He spent very little time in there, finding afterward that his skin had flushed a slight red tint, though it returned to normal shortly afterward. He did not go to the infirmary for a checkup, nor did he intend to reveal this to anyone. All manner of recent signs had indicated that the prophecy was gradually coming to pass, and all people, regardless of whether they believed in it or not, had their own views on the matter, and did not really need this extra information.\nHe had encountered some inmates with academic research backgrounds, though their numbers were relatively few, and they were prone to mad babbling even when clear-headed. They called this a malady common to all historians, and begged his forbearance in the matter. Wriothesley, of course, did not mind, and indeed, he was very interested in their arguments. And according to some schools of thought, if rising and falling were common in this world, then that great sea that once swallowed Remuria may perhaps return someday. In that sense, the prophecy was not really a prophecy, then, but was instead the expression of a rational pattern.\nAs with many other things, he was somewhat on the fence about this reasoning. The Fortress was no stranger to issues that needed \"mediation,\" with eyewitnesses often giving different testimonies. As such, he would reserve judgment on all records, and especially historical chronicles, for was poetic exaggeration not common practice in such writing? \"Even the great dragon beneath the abyssal depths submitted to his power...\" And how was anyone to know if this so-called great dragon was not just some very large vishap?\nOnce all embellishments were removed, what still remained were the actual things he needed to take note of.\nThroughout his as-yet unfinished life, Wriothesley has always seemed to be preparing for something. No matter what, he does not wish for people to be ruled by terror. And once the personal element of fear has been removed, what remains is something more akin to a sense of danger. He would like to make some preparations in response to the crisis, even if it might prove futile in the end.\nHistory is, after all, vast and terrible, and humanity is no more than seashells to be smashed upon the seashore by its great waves. Thus, he began to prepare for the creation of the Wingalet, expending vast resources and employing much manpower, though he did not put more stock into its success. It was a ship designed for fleeing disaster — an insurmountable chasm lay between it and golden Fortuna, bringer of civilization and glory.\nNonetheless, if it could indeed serve its purpose, Jurieu and Lourvine's many quarrels would not have been for naught.\n\"Thusly do the ancient writers concur — 'Oceans will rise, empires will fall, and the only constant is change.'\"",
            "Vision\tStanding before the registration counter at the Fortress, Wriothesley reached into his pocket to produce the sheet of paper that had his name and the length of his sentence on it.\nBut out with that sheet also came a glass ball about the size of his palm.\nNo, wait, this wasn’t just some random glass ball. Wriothesley blinked. When had he come into possession of this?\nThe person at the desk — a stern-looking lady with a wrinkled face — gasped, before steadying her shocked expression, gripping her pen tighter. Her lips moved, and moved again, but at last closed.\n\"She must have a lot of experience about living here,\" he immediately thought, and so he did his best to hold the Vision in his palm, before asking in a small voice, \"Miss, may I ask...\"\nThe senior registrar did not reply. She took the slip of paper from him and looked coldly behind him, as if sizing up the next criminal who'd come to register. However, when she had finished filling the necessary information in, she had written something unnecessary in the margins of the documents she passed back to him. \"Hide it well.\"\nWriothesley realized immediately that life at the Fortress would be even harder than roaming the streets.\nHe felt fortunate that he had blocked everyone behind him from seeing what had happened, and more fortunate still that this kind-hearted registrar had been willing to give him a reminder. Sadly, he would not see her again, though this was no surprise, since staff turnover at the Fortress was quite high in those days.\nThe first thing he did upon officially entering the Fortress was to quietly unravel a few threads of his clothing before using fine wire to sew his Vision into the space between the layers of fabric.\nHe knew a thing or two about being homeless — certainly, that the biggest problem was never getting a hold of resources, but keeping them. People could not avoid sleeping, and occasionally being defenseless. The things you owned could be taken away with ease once you were asleep, and no one would call it a robbery.\nAnd a Vision was no ordinary treasure. There were sure to be those who would be interested in it for various reasons, and Vision wielders were often magnets for ill-intentioned gazes.\nIn the days that followed, his suspicions would be verified, for in gossip alone he heard of two to three Vision thefts. As for what happened afterward and the fate of the victims, various inconsistent rumors existed that Wriothesley pretended to pay little mind to.\nHe still felt quite fortunate, of course, but it was hard to feel genuine happiness at staying safe off the backs of other peoples' tragic fates.\nFor a long time afterward, he would pretend that he had not been favored by the gods, and in truth, it was not hard — merely a return to his scrappy past. He could handle that much.\nThis persisted until a time when his age had nearly doubled, and he received an official invitation from the Palais Mermonia.\nCommon practice dictated that citizens who were to receive an honorary title must attend an investiture ceremony, and said ceremony was said to be far more involved for the granting of a title such as \"Duke.\"\nWriothesley tactfully declined attending the ceremony on the grounds of his unique duties, expressing the desire to simply sign and take the relevant certificates. Quite un-Fontainian of him, really, to dislike the spotlight and prefer to just muddle along.\nMany workdays and much correspondence later, the Palais finally agreed.\nBefore leaving the underwater stronghold, Wriothesley took his Vision up once more, for the first time in many years. Weighing it in his palm, he found it lighter than before, and smaller to boot. Finding a good spot on his clothes, he hung it there.\nThe first to comment on it was the Iudex, who was to bestow the title upon him. Neuvillette’s smile was suitably polite, but he somehow seemed more pleased than Wriothesley himself. \"Congratulations,\" said the Iudex. \"You have found something you wish to do at last, I see.\"\nWriothesley smiled back by way of reply, but made no further comment."

I've offered to tone down the spice a bit for him, but he absolutely insists that he prefers the authentic flavor... And he's not even just saying that to be polite.

            "Character Story 5\tAfter sampling every dish there was in Liyue, Xiangling's culinary skills drastically improved. Her specialty spicy dishes earned the praise of even her father, a veteran chef with over two decades of experience.\nShe created her unique and complex flavor profile through a generous helping of chili peppers mixed with fruits and herbs for increased aroma. She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: Black-Back Perch Stew, which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.\nSome have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes.\n\"Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight. Dry, then grind to a fine powder. Sprinkle into any dish for an aromatic boost.\"\nThis is one of Xiangling's secret recipes, arrived at through a painstaking process of trial and error.\nIn Xiangling's case, that means countless bouts of diarrhea, countless bruised knees bashed on rocky cliffs, and countless wasted potfuls of food that didn't quite turn out as expected.",
            "Xiangling's Map\tThis map of Teyvat is lined with dense notations in various colors, and if you read closely, you can find the places where Xiangling has been, and where she intends to go in future.\n\"The shellfish of the shallows around Guyun Stone Forest are unmatched in their freshness. They say that 'here be sea monsters'?\"\n\"Sea monster meat tastes great. Should look for Beidou to go fight another one. Will steaming them with eggs make them taste better?\"\n\"There's a dragon in Mondstadt? Great! I just need three days of provisions to get there.\"\n\"Valberries are sweet. Lots here. I'll bring a basket. Take some back. See if they'll grow.\"\n\"This Mondstadt restaurant's Sautéed Matsutake is way too luxurious! They should just sell the matsutake. Ooh, what if I fry some with Jueyun Chili? Sounds good already. Might as well borrow a kitchen tomorrow and give it a go.\"\n\"Haven't found the dragon yet. Am I in the right place?\"\n...",
            "Vision\t\"You can make something super delicious out of any kind of ingredient.\"\nXiangling earned the approval of a Vision by shouldering this ideal in a wholehearted and unreserved manner. Even when she would make dishes that could be called \"horrifying,\" her desire to keep trying to match ingredients would never waver.\n\"Ugh... Qingxin Fried Lizard is actually kinda bad. I think lizards should just be stone-grilled in future.\"\n\"Slime fried rice is also rather ordinary. Maybe we'll try putting mushrooms in a slime jus next time.\"\nThough her friends fell around her during the epic battles with the taste of her dishes and advised her to turn back, Xiangling never stopped thinking about how to turn these \"special\" ingredients into delicious food.\nIn Xiangling's innocent and persistent heart, as long as they were not poisonous, there were no good or bad ingredients.\nHer Vision, after all, proves that even the gods approve of such thinking."

Are there any of them as amenable to conversation as oneself? Let us brew some tea, and then you can tell me all about it.",
            "More about Xianyun: II\tThere was a time when many mortals longed to seek the guidance of the adepti. One knows not how they discovered the location of one's abode, but every other day or so, one would find people leaving offerings of food at the altar on Mt. Aocang... Hmph, why ever would mortals expect an adeptus to interrupt their meditation for the sake of ingesting a mortal meal? Most bemusing. Nevertheless, since their actions were heartfelt, one saw only fit to indulge in— Ahem, to embrace their offerings once they had departed.",
            "More about Xianyun: III\tThen there were those who came right to one's doorstep, requesting to be taken on as disciples. One refused to grant them an audience, but they simply would not leave, and before long, Mt. Aocang had become something of a pilgrims' campsite... One promptly posted a sign outside the abode, decreeing that all would-be disciples must first present ninety-nine dishes over a period of as many days, each dish unique in its recipe and featuring the Qingxin as the main ingredient... Naturally, the crowd soon dispersed. Hmph, to master the adepti arts and the mechanical arts requires supreme talent and the utmost stillness of mind. Training would be a futile endeavor for those who cannot even persevere for a mere three months.",
            "More about Xianyun: IV\tFor all the wondrous feats that can be accomplished by one who has mastered the mechanical arts, one often uses it for purely recreational purposes. There was one year when it snowed heavily in Liyue, and Mt. Aocang was covered in several feet of snow. Seeing everyone cooped up in their abodes with nothing to do, one created a Snowdrift Mechanism for skiing on the mountains. One was having a tremendous time of it along with Guizhong and Streetward Rambler... until, of course, Moon Carver noticed as much and decided to join in. Moments later, he had managed to send the mechanism flying off the rails and plummeted deep into a snow bank. It took us hours to dig him out... Later, one introduced a great many safety features to the mechanism, to the point where it could be safely piloted by even a three-year-old child. Although this did entail a compromise on the top speed of the vehicle.",
            "More about Xianyun: V\tOne has read a great many works of popular literature since moving to Liyue Harbor. Those of the chivalric martial arts genre have proven the most entertaining, although the heroes within their pages are all works of the imagination. Would it not be even more compelling to tell the stories of the many such real-life figures with whom one is acquainted? It is a pity that one's disciples are so averse to one sharing the tales of their lives with other people... Perhaps you could relay more of the tales from your travels? One could adapt those into a novel instead.",

            "Character Details\tAccording to the \"Thrice Annotated Version of the Full Record of Pristine Pavilion,\" a roaming adeptus travels with the \"Spirit of Eight Pure and Mighty Rose-Clouds,\" dancing through the air as though \"riding light and striding lightning.\" Their lives, too, are long beyond mortal reckoning. What humans call a millennium is but time for a short rest for the adeptus in their abode. As the saying goes, \"Night and day belong not in paradise.\"\nAs for where the adepti dwell, the \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion\" asserts that the sky is their pillow and the earth their mat, and that they may dwell in the mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas — and this indeed seems to explain the countless adeptal encounters recorded in the annals of Liyue's history. This is one school of thought.\nAnother can be found in the classic treatise on metal and stone, \"Void-Pacing Stone Catalog.\" While showering praise upon the weird and wonderful rock formations of Jueyun Karst, \"Stone Catalog\" also proffers a warning: \"The peaks of Jueyun tower up to lofty heights, striving to outdo one another... each belonging to a different master — Qingyun Peak to Moon Carver, Mt. Hulao to Mountain Shaper, Mt. Aocang to Cloud Retainer. The wise climb not a mastered mountain, nor quarry its rocks.\"\nOut of a similar veneration, descriptions of what the adepti actually look like are few and far between. Based on a handful of allusions to Cloud Retainer's appearance in the historian Zichang's \"Stone Tablet Compilations,\" as well as scattered references in ancient songs, we can know that the adepti are ever-changing in form. To take Cloud Retainer as an example, when in human form, she is said to be \"of elegant countenance, dressed in purpled robes and made up like a flower in full bloom\"; whereas in bestial form, she \"flies with grace, soaring among the clouds and crying out to the moon.\"\nInterestingly, one particular tale recounted in \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion\" gives a further idea of the sublime character of the adepti. Once upon a time, a traveler happened upon Cloud Retainer while passing through Jueyun Karst. Taking out a self-made timepiece which he proudly dubbed a \"Jade Bottle Float-Type Water Clock,\" he sought to impress his ingenuity upon the adeptus. But to his surprise, she instead summarily pointed out the flaws of using a float-type water clock to record the passing of time. Hearing this, the traveler begged for her guidance, which he eventually received before being sent back down the mountain.\nSuch tales are apt to make mortals lament — it is only after meeting an adeptus, free and unfettered by the material world, that one can truly realize how insignificant our lives are.",
            "Character Story 1\tEvery second of every day, Liyue Harbor bustles with throngs of people coming and going. Local businessman weighed down by sacks of gold, outlanders garbed in strange attire, shrewd and canny public servants, warm-hearted guards... People from all walks of life with all sorts of personalities mingle, to the extent that no one looks out of place.\nWhen someone new suddenly appears in a city like this, people don't bat an eyelid.\nThis particular newcomer to Liyue Harbor is a woman who goes by the name of Xianyun. Tall and slender, she wears a pair of red-rimmed spectacles and exudes an aura that makes her stand out from the crowd.\nTo the Fontainian merchants who sell their mechanical creations on the streets of Liyue, she's already a familiar figure. When passing by, she invariably stops to discuss mechanical design with them — and once such discussions get started, entire afternoons fly by before anyone notices. She seems well acquainted with Chef Mao and Xiangling from Wanmin Restaurant as well, and is often to be seen sitting at a table opposite Guoba, waiting for a bowl of piping hot Dragon Beard Noodles. And she's also made an impression on the waiters of both Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion, where she sometimes dines as the guest of Mr. Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Granny Shan, the toy seller, remembers her too. If memory serves, she'd tell you, Xianyun's the one who often brings along a young woman with long, white hair to look at her kites and other trinkets. The young woman, whose name she now recalls is Shenhe, never seems to find anything that takes her fancy — yet Xianyun always brings her back nonetheless.\nJust like many other residents of Liyue Harbor, it seems that Xianyun not only has hobbies of her own, but also travels widely and has many friends.\nSo when people see her chatting with Madame Ping by the fish pond nearby Yujing Terrace, they think nothing of it.\n\"I haven't seen much of Mountain Shaper lately. And Moon Carver still hasn't returned that Multi-Purpose Abode Cleaning Talisman I lent him, to this day...\"\n\"Is that so? What might that be then, some sort of new sigil contraption you've come up with?\"\n\"Yes, let me tell you all about it...\"\nEach day, there comes a time when the lights of thousands of homes finally go out, and Liyue Harbor falls silent for a brief while. With nothing more to see before morning, Xianyun takes this opportunity to take a stroll along the narrow path that winds up Mt. Tianheng.\nJagged outcrops pose little obstacle for Xianyun. With a quick jump up and a gust of wind below, she's already at the top in the blink of an eye.\nGazing down upon the murky streets far below, the human known as Xianyun transforms into a crane, and with a flap of her wings lifts herself up toward the firmament.\nBut of course, there's really nothing strange about any of this. Liyue Harbor is a city that embraces all — so it's only natural that some adepti would end up living here too.",
            "Character Story 2\tSome of Liyue's history has simply been lost to the sands of time. The rest has either left its mark on the land in the form of ancient ruins, or — thanks to the painstaking efforts of those with adeptal affinity — made it into the annals of history. Aside from traveling to all corners of the land, those who would seek to understand Liyue's history must therefore look to the history books. Naturally, book collectors have played an important role in this process. One such individual is the great scholar of Liyue Harbor who refers to himself as \"Scholar Dongming.\"\nDongming is closely acquainted with Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's consultant Mr. Zhongli, and indeed often entreats him to help assess the authenticity of ancient texts. On one such occasion, Zhongli had a matter at hand that prevented him from attending in person, so he sent a friend in his stead.\nThis particular friend turned out to be a tall, slender woman who wore red-rimmed spectacles and introduced herself as Xianyun. At first, Dongming assumed that she would be a person of culture and learning just like Mr. Zhongli. But upon entering, she displayed no apparent interest in the ancient texts before her, and the only thing that seemed to catch her eyes was the old mechanical lock on the door. Overcome by nerves, Dongming was for a time at a complete loss for words. As if she could sense the awkward silence hanging on the air, Xianyun took charge and began to speak. To put Dongming's nerves at ease, she reassured him that her eyesight was perfectly adequate for judging the veracity of ancient texts, and then began to talk about her glasses.\nIt turned out that there was nothing wrong with Xianyun's eyesight, and that she didn't even need glasses to see clearly. \"Glasses,\" she explained, \"not only help people see, but can be worn as accessories too, you know! And once you've realized that... Why limit yourself to the boring colors? What's wrong with red rims anyway?\"\n\"What an interesting person...\" thought Dongming to himself.\n\"Besides, don't glasses put people at ease? Don't they feel more... human?\" A sudden change of expression passed over Dongming's face when he heard this.\n\"I mean, more in line with the local fashion. I'm not from Liyue Harbor, after all.\"\n\"Ah, that explains it then...\" thought Dongming, who himself was not a local either. Hearing her say this made him feel that little bit closer to Xianyun — close enough, in fact, to steer the topic back to those ancient texts that he wanted her to assess.\nAfter looking through the texts for a moment, Xianyun frowned and exclaimed: \"'Shaped like a bull, with a winged tail'... Why on earth would Fujin of the North choose to take such a form? And the part about Mountain Shaper... it's all nonsense.\"\nOne way to judge the authenticity of ancient writings is to examine their contents. Given that the expert before him believed the records to be erroneous, it seemed to Dongming that this book — which he had acquired for quite the pretty price — was most probably a forgery. Collecting ancient texts is an exhausting and expensive endeavor, and requires tightening your belt from time to time in order to make ends meet. Dongming couldn't help but smile bitterly as he reflected on the misfortunes he'd faced in life. His parents and wife had already passed away, and now these books were his only escape from the sorrows of living.\nWith a voice overflowing with emotion, he sighed: \"Mortal lives are full of tribulation, while the adepti are unconstrained and carefree. I doubt I'll ever have the fortune to meet an adeptus.\"\nGazing down through her spectacles, Xianyun looked upon the haggard-looking book-collector for a moment, before replying: \"It is said that in ancient times, people who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the trials of heaven and earth, and only then might they be granted the opportunity to prove their true intentions. The tortuous path to becoming an adeptus was no less painful than the agonies of mortal life.\"\n\"You're right... I've let myself get carried away.\"\nAfter a brief exchange, Dongming accompanied Xianyun back out of the library. Just before parting, she suddenly looked up as if she had recalled something, and said: \"Despite the fact that your book isn't genuine, if I were you, I'd consider taking that old lock on your door to an antique dealer. You might just find that it's worth at least as much as that book.\"\n\"And as for adeptal affinity... I wouldn't lose hope quite yet either. You have plenty of time ahead of you, so stay vital and look to the future.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tThe prevailing school of historical thought holds the following to be true: \"Since the beginning have things existed, the heavens and earth bounded by their limits, as do the myriad rivers of the world — extending off into the four directions — all know a beginning and an end. Through the cosmos, the immortals came into being without waiting for the gods, took form without waiting for light and dark — moistening the woods and grass, soaking into metal and rock, their way of nature, their beginning unknown, their end unknowable.\" In simple terms — the world has its limits, and the adepti were not in fact created by the gods.\nBefore the word \"Liyue\" even existed, the adepti already inhabited the mountains of this land. Among their number, some took it as their duty to protect the world and its people, while others were set on tyranny. Parts of this history have been recorded in \"Full Record of Pristine Pavilion\":\n\"The drought demon ran amok, setting the naked wilderness ablaze. The people's hearts were fumigated, driving them to the brink of despair. Beset by clouds of pestilence and miasma, they were gripped with worry. Who could they turn to? Who would save them?\n\"Upon arrival, the adeptus borrowed the wind to retain the clouds. Immediately, the clouds gathered together, and abundant rain burst forth from the heavens. Drought and plague were both driven away, and the people were saved.\"\nIt was this adeptus, respectfully addressed as \"Cloud Retainer\" by later generations, that saved humanity from the demon of drought in their hour of need. Filled with gratitude, the people recorded her deed of great benevolence with these words.\nLater on, the great war broke out among the gods. The values and compassion of Morax, the God of Contracts, won him the favor of Cloud Retainer and the other adepti, and so they followed him into battle, campaigning widely across the land. Finally they prevailed, restoring peace to the land and prosperity for the people.\nTales of that bygone era, with its heroes and adepti beyond number, have never failed to fascinate and impassion posterity. The towering figures of the adepti have imprinted themselves upon the very fabric of history, inspiring countless moving legends that have grown together with the people of Liyue. But when Xianyun hears humans tell their stories about the adepti, especially the parts about herself, she rarely seems to show excitement.\nOver the years, Jueyun Karst — which once echoed with the sound of joyful music — has become an unbearably lonely place to reside in. Nearly all her dear friends that once laughed by her side have perished in the raging fires of that war. Sometimes, the emptiness inside her is quite overwhelming. And though her companions sacrificed themselves willingly in defense of the world, she cannot help but lament their passing.\nBut despite this, the ironclad pact that was made with Rex Lapis all those years past still holds her to her vows; the contract is a living testament to the united determination and aspirations of all the adeptal hosts. The thought of forswearing her oath and leaving has never once crossed Xianyun's mind. More than anything else, she values the ties of friendship that bind her to her companions — if it was just to uphold the wishes of her deceased adepti friends, she would never abandon Liyue at a time of need.\nWith a mixture of regret and determination swirling through her heart, Xianyun's swelling thoughts gradually began to reside, and she listened in silence as the remainder of the human legend was told. When it was finally over, her response was simply:\n\"A compelling story indeed.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tIn the days before their friendships were torn asunder, the adepti would gather from time to time and fill Jueyun Karst with the merry sound of song and music.\nStreetward Rambler had the best sense of melody and played the zither with great beauty, while Guizhong was a natural composer.\nThe yakshas Bonanus and Indarias would often accompany Cloud Retainer, beating time and singing along to Streetward Rambler's melodies. Sometimes, when she was excited, Cloud Retainer would take on all kinds of different forms as she danced along with the gentle breeze.\nOn such occasions, the creatures of the mountains and rivers would raise their heads and prick up their ears, standing transfixed as they quietly enjoyed the blissful adeptal music. Other adepti too would stop to listen with gladness in their hearts.\nNowadays, a quietness has fallen upon Jueyun Karst, broken only by the whistle of the wind and the chirping of the birds.\nOccasionally, deep in the heart of Mt. Aocang, the sound of Cloud Retainer speaking with her disciples might be heard from the innermost recesses of her abode.\nOver the years, her compassion has driven her to take in many disciples. Some have tragic stories indeed, yet through years of assiduous training are no longer shrouded in melancholy, like buds that have weathered a frost emerging defiant from the melting snow.\nWatching them often brings her great joy. They embody the hopes that her friends once cherished, and thus through them their spirit lives on.\nThis is precisely why she's so protective of her young disciples. At times, her overflowing desire to care for them seems to overwhelm and confuse them — but she doesn't mind.\nAfter all, the young ones have never known the agony of being separated from their friends, nor beheld the sight of blood-soaked battlefields. How could they possibly know how much they meant to her? As long as they stay safe and sound, that's all that matters.",
            "Character Story 5\tNatural laws are mysterious and elusive, and thus do each of the adepti have their own unique methods of training.\nCloud Retainer espouses the investigative study of underlying laws. Wisdom must first be sought from external sources before insights are verified internally. One must refine oneself from the outside in, aligning inner thoughts with external realities to achieve a state of unity. The purpose of investigation is to explore the principles of all things, and thereby discover the universal truths that lie within. All that is in the world, sentient or not, embodies a set of principles — and only by researching and studying these principles can one understand the laws that all things obey. This is the way of true cultivation.\nThe fruits borne by millennia of such devotion have been great indeed, and naturally it is this wisdom that sets her apart from mortal folk. That they live such short lives seems a great pity to her, for even if it was her desire to do so, she would not have the time to teach these beings the full extent of her wisdom in its purest form. Besides, those with more limited faculties often found it difficult to comprehend such profundity, even with her guidance.\nBut after an intense bout of thinking, something occurred to her.\nThough mere mortals might have great difficulty apprehending the laws of nature through experience, she herself could invest truths into ingenious devices, and thus enlighten humankind through the medium of mechanics.\nFirstly, given that the laws of nature are profound and enigmatic, if she could dismantle them into a myriad of smaller principles and spread this knowledge through the world, perhaps this would help humans grasp them better.\nSecondly, basing production on the principles of mechanics would save an inestimable amount of manpower and resources.\nIf machines could be used to wash clothes, people would no longer have to lie there in their beds listening to the sound of clothes being laundered in the dead of night.\nAnd if people could use machines to walk, there'd no longer be such a thing as a long, arduous journey.\nIn the present day, peace prevailed throughout Liyue, and the land no longer relied on her to deliver it from drought by the blessing of a timely rain — nowadays, the people themselves could save their fields through irrigation. The fires of war were all but extinguished, and the people were content, now longing for prosperous lives.\nIn an age like this, upholding contracts and protecting the world was no longer simply a matter of slaying monsters and exorcizing demons. Creating mechanisms to improve people's lives was another equally valid way to achieve the same end.\nA mortal's life is limited, and expecting them to fully grasp the laws of nature or devote their whole lives to building an enduring legacy was simply unrealistic. But with her help... perhaps creating an earthly paradise wasn't just a pipe dream after all.\nThough the songs that rang through Jueyun Karst would never be heard again, the laughter that resounded in all corners of the city could still be preserved... That was something she could do, and something she yearned for from the bottom of her heart.\nBesides, Cloud Retainer truly is passionate about her mechanisms, to the point that she'll often forget to eat and sleep when she's working on a new one, despite how much she loves her fine cuisine.\nNo one knows when it started, but Cloud Retainer's fascination for the study of mechanisms now grips her almost to the point of obsession — something that every single one of her disciples is all too aware of...",
            "Jadevoid\tLegend has it that the place where an adeptus resides is known as their Jadevoid. The adeptal abodes tucked away among the peaks of Jueyun Karst are just such places.\nThe word \"Jadevoid\" originates from a spot among the clouds high above Qingyun Peak which overlooks the world below. This is a place that has rarely been seen by mortal eyes.\n\"Jade\" refers to the foundation of this place, which was made from a single piece of Plaustrite — hence why it floats above the clouds.\nThe true way is found in emptiness, and thus can be attained by traversing the void. Once, those who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the trials of heaven and earth. This place served as the trial of \"heaven.\"\nOriginally, however, the Jadevoid was not created by the adepti as a test of the spirit. Instead, it was created by Cloud Retainer as a locale for reflection and meditation. It was only later that Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper persuaded her to lend this place for the benefit of those who might come seeking the adeptal path. Hearing that Rex Lapis had given his assent and that Guizhong and Streetward Rambler both agreed as well, Cloud Retainer readily gave up the Jadevoid and had a small pavilion built upon it.\nNowadays, few are able to follow the adeptal path, and the Jadevoid — almost nothing now but a legend among mortals — has returned to the care of Cloud Retainer. But today, returning to this place above the clouds, her state of mind has changed.\nThough the vast sea of clouds and the sight of the sun as it rises and sets are as magnificent as ever, her thoughts have begun to drift off to the lively bustle of the mortal world.\nNow, she yearns to live alongside the humans under the name of Xianyun.\n\"As it just so happens, I'm starting to feel hungry. How about... some of Wanmin Restaurant's delectable Crab Roe Tofu.\"",
            "Vision\tThe adepti of Liyue were born amongst the elemental energy that courses between heaven and earth. As pure elemental beings, they are closer to the origin of ultimate truth than ordinary mortals.\nFor Xianyun, channeling elemental power is something that can be done almost subconsciously. She requires the aid of no external focus to do so, let alone a Vision.\nBut now that she's walking the mortal realm in human form, following human rules somehow seems oddly appropriate. To her, using a Vision as a medium to harness elemental power couldn't be easier... so why not?\n Xianyun certainly does not value the Vision that she wears on her arm in the same way that a mortal would. But carrying it with her led to a discovery.\nOne time, as she was passing through Dihua Marsh, she came upon a farmer. Despite the fact that he was tall and carried a hoe, he was trembling and immobilized with fear in the face of a pair of short, feeble-looking bandits who were threatening him with daggers. Intending to help, Xianyun stepped forward — but seeing that she was a woman and slightly-built to boot, he tried to persuade her to stay out of it so she wouldn't get hurt.\nBut when Xianyun turned to speak to him, he saw her Vision and immediately took her for a chivalrous hero instead. His tone and posture changed in the blink of an eye, and after bidding her join him in driving off the bandits, he charged straight at them. In the end, the hoe-brandishing farmer singlehandedly repelled the two thieves, with Xianyun merely knocking a dagger out of one of their hands. Yet looking at the shining Vision on her arm, the farmer kept exclaiming how much he wished he had one.\nOf course, the farmer didn't need a Vision — all he really needed was a little courage. But she saw the effect that the Vision had on him, and how his expression changed so completely it was almost as if he had become another person. The profound influence that an external object could exert upon a person became apparent in that instant.\nFor a time, this left her feeling puzzled.\nThough it may be true that everything in this world possesses its own objective characteristics, but changing how you act towards a person because of an external object... surely that was folly in almost all cases. Known for her candor, she has always been easily moved to commend or scorn, but her judgment was always based on essence rather than appearance.\nWhen people are friendly to her, she treats them kindly back; but when they're vile, all she has for them is her contempt. This is how she is when she's Cloud Retainer, so it's how she'll be as the chivalrous hero Xianyun too.\n\"Open your eyes and take a look around — I didn't lift a finger. Since you can rely on your own skill to drive away your enemies, you should show some more confidence.\" Xianyun had said her piece, so with a flick of her sleeve, she was off.\nWith heroism she cleanses the world below, and with wisdom imparts the laws of nature. To this day Xianyun walks the mortal realm still, poised and unaffected."

            "Character Details\tXiao may have the appearance of a young man, but his true age is something over two thousand years.\nFortunately, people do not tend to underestimate him on the basis of his appearance — one only needs to spend a short time with Xiao to clarify that he is not someone to be trifled with.\nXiao is a man of few words. He is highly dangerous, and has the most piercing gaze you've ever seen.\nHe enjoys a formidable reputation and high level of seniority among the adepti, but is relatively unknown in the mortal realm.\nThis is inevitable. Xiao is not one of those popular deities to whom people pray for wealth and protection, nor is he a mystical sage of Jueyun Karst to whom pilgrims flock in search of divine wisdom.\nNo... If any mortal witnesses Xiao unleashing his true power, it is certain to be under the direst of circumstances — and they will be extremely lucky if they survive the ordeal.\nThis is not because Xiao seeks to harm people. Rather, since Xiao wages a constant war against dark forces powerful enough to devour Liyue in its entirety, any bystanders who witness him in the heat of battle are likely to end up as collateral damage.\nNot that this is a secret worth going around silencing witnesses for.",
            "Character Story 1\tWhat exactly is Xiao wrestling with?\nThe tactful answer would be old grudges, unfulfilled dreams, the lamentations of the vanquished...\nThe unmitigated truth is that Xiao fights against the remnants of the defeated gods from the Archon War, which took place prior to the rise of The Seven.\nMorax defeated those gods and buried their remains beneath the rocks of the earth.\nHowever, gods are immortal. Their consciousness may diminish, but their power and hatred will always remain and spread like poison, relentlessly stirring up chaos for the world and its inhabitants.\nLiyue's rulers, who are aware of the truth regarding Xiao, refer to him in his millennia-long experience as the \"Bane of All Evil.\" \nThe war he fights can never be won, and will never come to an end.\nIt is also an invisible war that no one will ever witness or thank him for.",
            "Character Story 2\tXiao is not this yaksha's true name, but a name given to him in the interests of his own protection.\nBack in a younger, more naive time, a god had gotten a hold of Xiao's weakness and forced him to serve as their bloodhound, in which capacity he was forced to perform cruel and violent acts.\nMany died at his hand, many hopes were crushed, and he was even forced into devouring his victims' dreams. As much as it pained him to do this, he was helpless to resist.\nFinally, on the battlefield of the Archon War, Morax, the Geo Archon, had a fateful encounter with the yaksha's master.\nThe current state of the world has already revealed the results of that battle.\nRex Lapis liberated the yaksha and gave him the name \"Xiao.\" \n\"In the fables of another land, the name Xiao is that of a spirit who encountered great suffering and hardship. He endured much suffering, as you have. Use this name from now on.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tTo repay his debt of gratitude to the Geo Archon, Xiao shouldered the burden of protecting Liyue in the millennia that followed.\nHis past of service under the evil god had rid Xiao of his innocence and gentleness. All that remained within him was the means to kill and the weight of his sins.\nThe only way he could be of service to mortals was in doing battle.\nBut what could people do for him in return?\nNo ordinary person would ever stop to ask such a question. The sight of Xiao, even far off in the distance, was intimidating enough to send people instantly running for their lives.\nThat said... if ever someone did want to show some appreciation for Xiao, there is perhaps one thing they could try.\nThere is a certain secret agent of the Qixing who is tasked with supporting Xiao in subduing demons. That secret agent runs a front organization called the Wangshu Inn.\nOccasionally, Xiao stops by the inn for a bowl of Almond Tofu, and if you could see the look on his face when he eats it... there's no mistaking it — he clearly loves the stuff.\nNonetheless, it is not the sweet taste that Xiao hankers after. It's the texture he finds irresistible — apparently, it's very similar to that of the dreams he used to devour.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhat exactly is Xiao wrestling with?\nTo those in Liyue's corridors of power, Xiao's battle is against the evil manifestations produced by the remnants of defeated gods.\nHowever, if you asked Xiao the same question, he may well give you an entirely different answer.\nXiao was once enslaved by an evil god and suffered immensely under their rule until finally regaining his freedom thanks to Rex Lapis.\nXiao's powers were highly regarded by the adepti and he seemed to vanquish all manner of evil demons with consummate ease.\nBut the evil gods also held immense power, and their lust for revenge ran deeper than mere mortals could ever contemplate. Xiao relentlessly slaughtered the endless, impure manifestations of their vengeful souls, but in doing so, he caused them to fracture. Eventually, these fragments of their hatred were able to taint Xiao's own soul.\nThe only way to eradicate such hatred is to accept the karmic debt it brings. The magnitude of the bad karma Xiao has accumulated over the years is enough to consume flesh, bone, and soul alike.\nAnd yet, Xiao does not feel any hatred. Having lived for over two thousand years, no single karmic debt constitutes anything more than a fleeting memory.\nNo grudge can last a thousand years, nor is any debt so great that it cannot be paid off in this time.\nXiao has spent many long years alone.\nBut his battles have never been in vain.\nBecause ultimately, the one with whom Xiao wrestles is himself.",
            "Character Story 5\tWhat does Xiao fight against?\nThe Traveler understands very well that Xiao fights against the darkness that threatens Liyue. He fights to defend Liyue.\nBut who will defend him?\nThere was once when most of Xiao's strength was spent fighting from dusk till dawn, with him emerging victorious by a mere hair.\nThe reeds in the fields had been sliced to ribbons in the fierce fighting. Plucking his spear from where it had been planted in the ground, Xiao began the trek home.\nWell, one says \"home\" — yet, where did Xiao have to return to? He was merely leaving the battlefield.\nLong exhausted, Xiao felt the divine hatred that tainted his body take effect.\nLimitless hate flooded his senses, and he fell to the ground in agony.\nBut it was also at that moment that the pain vanished without warning.\nThis was not by Xiao's own strength, for he had been rescued by the sound of a flute.\nThe clear, lovely sound of the flute came over the mountains and rivers, carried on the wind to where he lay.\nAnd clear it continued to ring till the first light of dawn brought with it the startled flight of distant birds.\nIt protected Xiao, massaging his wild senses, and giving him a moment's peace.\nWho was playing this music? Xiao was curious but did not pursue the matter. For he already had something approaching an answer.\nThe last person who could help him was one of The Seven themselves. So this person, too, must be—",
            "Ode to Windborne Wraith\tA scholar of the Sumeru Akademiya once did folklore studies in Liyue, the result of which was a book called \"Tour of the Land of Liyue,\" with separate editions being available in Sumeru and Liyue.\n\"Hidden Diamond and Cloudy Moon: Wonders and Folklores of Liyue\" is the version available in Liyue, and has had many mystical and magical portions removed.\nThe \"Ode to Windborne Wraith\" is one of the mystical chapters that remain recorded within the complete version at the Akademiya.\nThe document mentions that though the yaksha were mighty and upright among the adepti, they were bound by their own karma to suffer great horrors and tribulations. As such, they wandered the land in a state of unending suffering.\nThe chapter lists many methods of comforting the yaksha, such as food offerings, holy chants, and the like. These would appease the yaksha and help them to continue defending the peace.\nAs noble warriors among adepti, the yaksha would often descend upon the battlefield in person. However, as conflicts grew over the millennia, they have almost been wiped out. Today, large statues of the yaksha subduing demons remain within Liyue's borders, but they have had their features destroyed.\nBy the by, the language used in that text was so meandering, and its contents so dense, that it sold far fewer copies than the Teyvat Travel Guide and the international cultural summaries written by El Musk.",
            "Vision\tAll adepti are known as the \"mighty and illuminated\" adepti, and this \"illumination\" refers to the light of a third \"eye\" that they possess: a Vision.\nBut do adepti receive their Visions as a form of acknowledgment from Celestia, like humans do?\nXiao no longer remembers the moment he received his Vision. To humans, this would be an unforgettable event. But for him, this was just the beginning of his endless battle.\nThe thing that Xiao truly cannot forget is something different.\nThere are a great many human festivals, and few remember the stories behind them.\nThe greater part of these days coincide with occasions where man-eating monsters were defeated by the adepti host. People imitated their deeds and staged exorcism rituals to remember their ancient heroism, with these practices eventually evolving into celebratory festivals.\nThe hatred and residual might of many of the gods defeated by Morax throughout Liyue will sometimes erupt with abnormal force amid their half-awake, half-dreaming state. Among them, the eruption that takes place during the Lantern Rite is the most extreme in scale.\nXiao has his mission to perform the time-honored \"Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering,\" and so he fights night and day during the Lantern Rite. Thus, he has come to hate it.\nNow, Xiao did not consider battle dangerous. It was due to his hard work that Liyue was kept safe. People lit their lanterns, and the blessed lights shone across the night sky and the nearshore.\nAt that moment, another special feeling blossomed in Xiao's heart. Loneliness? Peace? Or was it his fears for the future? The young-seeming adeptus searched his heart, only to find no answers."

            "Character Details\tEvery merchant in Liyue Harbor knows of Xingqiu from the Feiyun Commerce Guild.\nAll see him as a kind and well-mannered young man who is an excellent student, a top talent in every sense.\nAs the second-born son of the family, Xingqiu is not required to shoulder the burden of managing the Guild's affairs. However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers — that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants — and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.\nXingqiu's elder brother, while learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.\nHowever, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.\nSometimes, Xingqiu suddenly disappears for hours at a time with no explanation. When asked why, he simply replies: \"A moment of solitude.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tTo Xingqiu, \"a moment of solitude\" can mean all sorts of things.\nExamples include visiting Wanwen Bookhouse to peruse the latest novels and going to Heyu Tea House to sample Yun Jin's latest drink.\nSometimes, it means that he is off to fight for justice in the name of chivalry.\nDefeating bandits on the road, driving away monsters, helping distressed children by fetching their kites from the tree tops... there are all manner of responsibilities that fall into the category of chivalry.\nInspired by tropes from his beloved martial arts novels — such as the king who wears a disguise and mingles with the common folk — Xingqiu does not hesitate to leverage the power of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to resolve more complex issues when violence isn't the answer.",
            "Character Story 2\tOne day, Xingqiu's older brother came looking for him, only to find he wasn't around. When Xingqiu later returned, he came across his brother in the hallway.\n\"Your room was a mess, so I cleaned it up. Listen, both you and I are responsible for the reputation of Feiyun Commerce Guild. We have to act the part. If you can't clean up a room, how will you clean up the world? An adeptus once said...\"\nAfter half an hour of lecturing, Xingqiu was finally let go, but his brother said something strange at the end:\n\"I'll not enter your room without permission next time... I'll make sure the maids do the same.\"\nXingqiu had no idea what he was talking about. However, as his brother turned away, with a despondent look upon his face, he muttered to himself:\n\"Those books under his bed... No. No, I shouldn't go looking at what kind of books they are... Xingqiu is growing up after all... Don't want to be lecturing him all the time... Puberty perhaps?\"\nAfterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd. Expecting that one of the maids would have something to say about the stash of martial arts novels under his bed, he had long since prepared his response, but in the end, no one ever bothered to check his room again.",
            "Character Story 3\tTo keep Xingqiu from spending his whole day at Wanwen Bookhouse in Feiyun Slope, his father agreed to let him learn martial arts from the Guhua Clan. Much to his dismay, Xingqiu quickly discovered that Guhua was a dying art that had been in constant decline for years. There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan — they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.\nXingqiu's father was, of course, fully aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun. He thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.\nHe hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.\nXingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught to be exactly what he had hoped for.\nQuicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.\nHe decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it would take him. He reasoned that they would be useful to have in his repertoire during his future exploits as a chivalrous hero.",
            "Character Story 4\tThere are two sides to the swashbuckling Xingqiu's personality. While quiet and unassuming in front of strangers, he is gregarious and chatty in the company of close friends and family. Though more restrained than his elder brother, he even has a playful and mischievous side.\nThe one who usually bears the brunt of his bizarre sense of humor is someone named Chongyun, an exorcist usually found on one of the forest trails around Liyue.\n\"Chongyun... I found a haunted house for you to practice in...\"\n\"Chongyun, you have to believe me... It wasn't me who laid the traps inside that haunted house— What? It's not haunted? Well... I, uh, couldn't have known that, could I?\"\n\"Chongyun... Don't glare at me like that... Look, you're injured. You'd better just lie there and get some rest.\"\n\"Tell you what, Chongyun, we have a maid who learned the art of essential oil therapy in a nobleman's house in Sumeru... How about I ask her to tend to your wounds? You owe me for this, though...\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe notion of chivalry means different things to different people.\nChivalry means listening to your conscience calling you to action when you see an injustice, right? Or is chivalry simply about knowing right from wrong? No, that's not enough — it must have something to do with being a righteous person...\nTo Xingqiu, chivalry simply means: be good, and do good.\nAs a son of a wealthy merchant in Liyue Harbor, he was born to ride the waves in the world of trade. Notions of chivalry should have gradually left him as he grew up.\nHowever, obtaining a Vision changed everything — it meant he was finally able to accomplish those legendary deeds he could only dream of as a child.\nOf course, there is no way he can completely divest himself of his duties in the Guild, but so long as he gets to go out and be the hero even occasionally, he is perfectly content with his life.\nThe only thing that can wipe the smile from Xingqiu's face is when cynics question the true motives of chivalrous heroes.\nRank, reputation, reward, shadowy deals... Whenever Xingqiu hears people smearing the names of true heroes, the expression on his face may not change, but he will be sure to add that person to the special section of his blacklist reserved for people he despises even more than carrots.",
            "\"A Legend of Sword\"\tXingqiu once wrote a martial arts novel named \"A Legend of Sword\" based on his own experiences, intending to publish it in Liyue Harbor.\nTo his surprise, his manuscript was rejected by local publishing houses, who believed that no one would have any interest in a story with \"a setting as wildly unrealistic as the plot is banal.\"\nUndeterred, Xingqiu had a few copies printed privately, and sneakily placed them on the shelves of Wanwen Bookhouse during one of his many trips there. But just as the publishers had suspected, it failed to garner much interest from readers. This was quite a blow to Xingqiu's confidence.\nUnbeknownst to him, however, a passing merchant from Inazuma did purchase a copy to bring home, where it received rave reviews. Writers the region over attempted to copy the success of \"A Legend of Sword,\" but none succeeded — it maintains permanent residency in the number one bestseller spot to this day.",
            "Vision\tThe martial arts school known as the Guhua Clan has been in decline for several hundred years now. In its heyday, the name of the Clan rang like steel throughout the harbor. It was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts — the ways of the \"Light Piercer\" for polearms, \"Rain Cutter\" for swords, and \"Life Ender\" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.\nAfter many years, the Guhua Clan would finally get one in Xingqiu. It was he who successfully grasped the ancient \"Martial Principle\" after merely four years of study.\nThe Guhua weapon arts stress using the weapon as an extension of your body, and indeed this is a common idea amongst the various schools of martial arts in Liyue. But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial artists were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the \"eye.\" \nHaving come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that \"it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu.\" Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.\nThe verse reads thus:\nGuhua's arts I have studied long, in its secrets I am trained, now its long-lost depths fall upon me like the coming of blessed rain.\nThe beating heart of Guhua's sword art is as a shower of floating flowers. One amidst may seize a bloom, but those without read only doom.\nThe Guhua lance is a lantern's dance, like flames in night's deep glooming. Like sparks, they scatter with ease in the dark, then join like the daybreak looming.\nThey say the sword is as your arm — I say its glint is the beholder's eye, a light like the bright dawn coming.\nThose who wander are burdened not. Freely they cut rain, and enlightened they pierce light. Like a snaking dragon, they cannot be subdued. In their right eye the blade, and in the other the spear.\nThis text should have been free for all to read. The only reason why it was sealed is the dreadful handwriting."

Well, word is that you've been all over the place, Traveler. So, what say you sign me up for your world tour? Anywhere's good!",

            "About Xinyan: Frightening\tNot afraid of me, are you? Some folks say I've got eyes like knives, that I don't wear my clothes right, that I don't speak right. They give me a pretty wide berth, too. Really, can't a girl sport her own style without bein' looked at like she's some weird creature outta who-knows-where?",
            "About Xinyan: Rock 'N' Roll\tRock 'n' roll came to Liyue from Fontaine, so I guess you could call it a new thing. But it's not too hot around here. Most think it's an awful racket not fit for human ears. And that's why I appreciate everyone who does come listen, haha!",
            "About Us: The Audience\tYou wanna hear me play? Come to the front — it sounds best from there! *clears throat* Alright then, comin' at you from the one and only rock stage in Liyue!",
            "About Us: Kindred Spirits\tAnd here I was wonderin' why we got on so well! So you're not from this world, and that's why you don't care for its rules. Now that's how life should be like! Lose the red tape, and live free!",
            "About Us: Invitation\tI'd sure love to add some extra flavor to my rock 'n' roll. Wanna get on the drums next time? You've got a good sense of rhythm. ...You've never played? Don't sweat it, it's a question of soul, not skill! Give it a go, I just know you'll be great!",
            "About the Vision\tI'm guessin' that I'm the only person in Teyvat who uses the fire from their Vision in rock performances. Some say I should respect that power more... But the way I see it, the gods gave the Vision to me, so they like my style, don'cha think?",
            "Something to Share: Naming\tI made this guitar myself, y'know? Based it off a rock 'n' roll instrument from Fontaine at first, but it stopped looking like the original real fast. I wanted to give it a rad name, like \"The Fyre Lyre,\" or \"The Jadebreaker,\" or \"The Hill Stiller.\" Still, feels like we're missin' something... Any ideas?",
            "Something to Share: Opera\tYou ever heard of opera? It's what those rich guys listen to at their banquets. It's all tenor this and falsetto that... Gettin' so uptight about music, ugh — it's just not rock 'n' roll.",

            "About Xiangling\tI have dinner at the Wanmin Restaurant often. If Xiangling's got some time on her hands, we'll chat till it's real late. Eh? You wanna know what I order? See... I actually eat everything she makes. It's never the same thing, and the flavor's different each time, too. Ooh, she's the rock star of the culinary world, she is!",
            "About Zhongli\tThere was this one fellow who invited me to perform at his place, back when there weren't many who would give my music the time of day. I was touched, let me tell you what. Like, hey, someone gets it! I agreed right away... But when I got there, I found out that he was the consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. What a weird guy. I mean, how was that appropriate?",
            "About Ningguang\tY'know, the Millelith used to get in my way all the time. Can't set up a stage here, can't perform there. Real bother, it was... Ahem. But after I wrote to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, I heard that the Tianquan amended one of Liyue's... Uh, some rule or something. She designated some spots for performances to take place, so long as you apply. *sigh* It's still a load of trouble if you ask me, but it's better than being harangued by those Millelith every time, so...",
            "About Baizhu\tDr. Baizhu's prescriptions are the tops at preserving my voice. I did an impromptu performance for him as thanks, but... the snake he keeps around his neck fainted away. Haha, now it ducks up Dr. Baizhu's sleeve every time I'm around. I only discovered afterwards that snakes are very sensitive to vibrations.",
            "About Beidou\tHer? She speaks her mind and has a big heart, and we get on great. The Crux's adventures are real epic. They've given me tons of inspiration in the past! I even wrote them a song. Nowadays, I just need to sing the first line, and most all the sailors will join in. It's fast becoming a new sea shanty, it is.",
            "About Chongyun\tHe's one interesting guy. He looks introverted enough, but there was this one time when he came to one of my performances. A friend brought him or something, and he had some words for me, but I couldn't hear 'em over the music. Before I knew it, he was right up there on the stage with me, singing and rockin' his heart out. Guess you really can't judge a book by its cover!",
            "About Hu Tao\tI've no clue what she's thinking, going around looking all happy-clappy like that when she's the head of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Always greets me cheerily too, saying \"I like people who play with fire, they're good for business\" or somethin' like that... She's a bit bizarre, I tell you.",
            "About Yun Jin\tTell you a secret — but you gotta keep it that way, you hear? She's real fond of rock 'n' roll. Comes to watch me at least three times a week no matter how packed her schedule is. You'd think that the head of Heyu Tea House's troupe would be into finer arts and all, eh? But I guess it gets suffocating after a while. Haha.",
            "About Gaming\tThe first time Gaming told me I had a bad case of \"rock 'n' roll fever,\" I checked my forehead to see if he was right. My temperature was fine, so I denied it. But he insisted it was true. We went back and forth arguing about it for hours before I realized it was all just a misunderstanding. Gaming explained that it was just another way to say you're a fan of something. Hahaha, there's never a dull moment when Gaming's around. Anyway, I've definitely come 'round to \"rock 'n' roll fever\" as an expression — I'll have to work it into the lyrics next time I write a song!",
            "More About Xinyan: I\tYou wanna know more about me? Haha! Well, aren't you just odd? Most people would do just the opposite. Well, where should we start? ...Eh, I guess we'll start with rock 'n' roll.",
            "More About Xinyan: II\tBack when I was little, the adults all said I had to be more girly, that I should learn and study all these things. Wasn't ever any good at it, though, and I'd often get roasted bad. Rock 'n' roll's a different story. No one ever taught me, but I can do it just fine. And of course, the adults say \"that's unladylike!\" *sigh* Talk about prejudice.",
            "More About Xinyan: III\tSay, do you notice anything different 'bout me today? I did some facial massages to relax my mouth and eyes, and practiced smiling less broadly in front of a mirror for half an hour. So, how'd it go? Do I look a bit less fierce than usual? ...Even scarier? Huh, okay...",
            "More About Xinyan: IV\tThanks for staying to jam with me! It's almost time for lunch. I've brought your share as well! We've got tomatoes, sausages, fried eggs... Say what? I don't seem like the type? H—Hey now, don't you look down on me. M—Making a nice-looking meal was no problem at all!",
            "More About Xinyan: V\tI believe in rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance, but I don't think it means that I have to go around shoving it in people's faces. I'm perfectly capable of living normally. I can sew, I can grow flowers and keep fish, and make nice-looking meals. I'm allowed to like anything... or anyone I want, right?",
            "Xinyan's Hobbies\tHobbies? Rock 'n' roll, of course! You ever have that something you put your all into? When everything you love comes together into one thing, the place and time loses all importance. You just need to enjoy it to the fullest, and express yourself to your heart's content! Haha... Ah, I can never get enough of that feeling.",
            "Xinyan's Troubles\t*sigh* I send children a-crying every time I accidentally lock eyes with them on the road. *sigh* If only there was a way to make me look a little less scary. But I've tried everythin', and nothing sticks...",
            "Favorite Food\tThe lunch down at the Liyue dockyards rocks! Ahh, oily, meaty... Bit skimpy on the vegetables, but I could never get tired of it! Far as I'm concerned, a whole day in the dockyards is worth it just for the lunch!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tNot that I'm picky, but I can't stand bland food. If it's supposed to be salty or spicy, make it salty or spicy! You can't have a good time if you don't go all-in on the flavor! Even if all I had on hand were enough ingredients for one serving of Jewelry Soup, I'd make sure I'd do right by them!",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tWowee, you've rocked my socks off with this one. I am moving to the groove of your awesome food! Mm-mm!",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tThe taste ain't bad, but it's lackin' that special spark... I can help you with the presentation if you want?",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tHmm... You don't mind if I add a little something to spice things up, do ya?",
            "Birthday\tHappy birthday! I made some embroidery especially for you. Check it out — I sewed both our images on in the style of Fontaine's dolls. Pretty cute, eh? ...Why are you looking at me like that? Wh—What, it's not that weird that I can do embroidery!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tThat's the groove, alright! That's what I'm talkin' about!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tI'm on fire lately. Look out for my next performance!",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tRock 'n' roll originates in Fontaine and is just starting to find its feet in Liyue Harbor, where Xinyan is pioneering the art.\nEvery night, she slings on her self-built instrument, steps onto her self-constructed stage, and plays her self-composed songs to a crowd of enthusiastic supporters.\nHer music reflects her personality: bold and defiant, loud and proud.\nShe is no virtuoso, but this doesn't bother her dedicated fans one bit as they let loose and enjoy the show, singing their hearts out and shaking off the stress of the day.\nIn the heat of the moment, the fire that leaps from Xinyan's Vision seems ready to turn night into day.\n\"She is a rare rock 'n' roll talent and a master performer who really knows how to create an atmosphere,\" said a review of one of her live shows in The Steambird.\nLiving in Liyue is expensive, especially when you want to enjoy the finer things in life. But as Xinyan would say to those tied down by worldly worries:\n\"If you know how to rock, then it's easier to roll.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tXinyan does not adhere to traditional performance norms at all. Anything can be used as her instrument.\nThe pillars on-stage, the floorboards, the cheers and yells of the audience, and even the explosions and sparks created by her Vision are valid brushes with which she paints her performance.\nThe impromptu stage often starts to burn somewhere after the halfway mark of the performance, till all that's left is a smoking pile of charcoal.\nAfter many warnings, the Millelith were finally forced to tighten their patrols and try to find ways to stop Xinyan from staging her performances.\nThe subsequent battles of wits tended to turn out in Xinyan's favor — she was often able to find a place to perform, set up a stage with frightening speed, and begin a raucous night with her audience.\nThe more reliable word on the street is that many patrolling Millelith were themselves infected by the \"spirit of rock 'n' roll,\" becoming her loyal fans in the process.\nXinyan would get wind of the Millelith's latest patrol plans from these \"friends of rock,\" and was thus able to avoid their eyes with ease.\nEventually, tiring of the lack of results, and in the absence of any evidence that anyone was harmed during Xinyan's performances, the Millelith came to adopt a \"one eye open, one eye shut\" approach to her actions.",
            "Character Story 2\tXinyan is tall, has a sharp gaze, and always wears her stage costume in public to keep herself in the right mood for her music.\nIn the eyes of bystanders, this makes her quite the imposing sight as she walks down the street, and many assume she means trouble.\nWhen she lines up to buy a snack, people in front of her in the queue will panic and move well out of her way.\nIf she happens to lock eyes with a young child, even for a brief moment, they will run crying to their parents.\nEven when she has done nothing at all, Xinyan is often suspected of wrongdoing, purely because her fierce appearance makes her look like some sort of heinous villain in the eyes of some people.\nXinyan didn't care all that much about how other people saw her, but she did think that it wasn't a good thing to scare others and make trouble for them, if she could at all help it. Thus, she constantly looked for ways to make a change.\nEvery day when she woke up in the morning, she would look at herself in the mirror and massage her face with her fingers to stretch and relax her eyes a little.\nShe would even practice smiling and study expressions — verbal and facial alike — of great elegance.\nAfter a significant amount of practice, she once came across a group of children bullying another child, and instinctually she went over to rescue the bullied child.\nShe gave the kid what she thought was a friendly smile and a gentle pat on the head. To say that the upset child quietened down after this would not be incorrect...\nHowever, the reality of the matter was that the child was stood there frozen in fear as urine dribbled down their pants.\nAs for the would-be bullies, they screamed and fled in panic.\n\"Run! Run! The angry lady's turned into a monster! Sh—She's gonna eat us all!\"\n\"Hey!!! I ain't gonna eat y'all! ...And I ain't no monster, either!\"\nBut it was to no avail. The moment she raised her voice, all her hard work was undone.",
            "Character Story 3\tXinyan has one standard by which she judges all things: is it or isn't it \"rock 'n' roll?\"\nAll that is just and upright — standing up for those who have been wronged, taking on challenges — is \"rock 'n' roll,\" and all that is reprehensible — fearing the wicked, oppressing the kind, dirty tricks, scheming ways — is \"not rock 'n' roll.\"\nRock is the spirit of rebellion and resistance, yes, but patently immoral acts are nonetheless \"not rock 'n' roll.\"\nXinyan reserves the right to make these judgments, and whether these judgments are based on results or her mood, the difference between the things covered by these two opposing terms is clear.\nThe only catch is that these standards sound odd in certain contexts.\nDue to her fierce appearance, Xinyan nearly has no friends, with Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant being one of the few exceptions with whom she can speak most freely.\nXinyan has a special reason for coming to Wanmin Restaurant — for musical inspiration.\nWhenever Xiangling is researching new recipes, others may run for the hills, but not Xinyan. She intentionally eats all the experimental products, and amid the taste bud explosion that results from the never-before-seen flavors, inspiration flows into her mind.\n\"Tell you what, Xiangling, that dish rocked!\"\nThough Xinyan considers this to be the highest praise, Xiangling finds it a little hard to be happy about such ratings.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe eternal subject of rock 'n' roll is resistance.\nBut the thing that Xinyan resists is not a concrete thing, but rather, the conceptual shackles of \"prejudice.\"\nShe was born into a poor family, and her parents placed great stock in her, giving her the best of what little they had in the hopes that she would be able to rise to \"become a phoenix.\"\nOf course, this \"phoenix\" would have to be something that they would recognize.\nBut things don't always turn out as planned. Xinyan grew to be taller than most girls, and her looks were far from anything that might be considered \"cute.\" Nor was she any good at any of the feminine arts, whether it was cooking, chores, needlework.\nSo, since her childhood was so deeply impacted by such \"prejudices,\" Xinyan understands how terrifying they could be.\nYet becoming a rock 'n' roll star has not caused her to give up on these other arts.\nThis is not only because she hates losing, but because she feels that \"giving up because you have no talent\" is itself a prejudiced belief.\nNot long ago, a fan of Xinyan's named Yun Jin was invited to her place as a guest.\nBut if Xinyan hadn't opened the door herself, Yun Jin would have thought that she had the wrong house.\nThe house was spick and span, the windows were clean, and the home ornaments were hand-made and immaculately arranged.\nThe cooktop was still moist, indicating that someone had been cooking not long before, and there was half-sewn cloth by the bedside that looked much like the decorations Xinyan wore during her performances.\nWhy, this was practically the room of some refined lady of reputable upbringing, with nary any spirit of rock 'n' roll to be found!\nXinyan was quite worried that this fan of hers would find the difference between their impression of \"rock 'n' roll\" and this reality too jarring.\nUnexpectedly, Yun Jin's support and fandom would only grow more intense after this.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe way Xinyan sees it, many adults fail to realize their potential because they are tied down by prejudice, giving in to fear and endless anxiety.\nThey do not understand what life is about, or where they are going.\nShe wrote these thoughts into her songs, but invited scorn from the very same adults. \"What does this brat know?\"\nEven so, Xinyan did not waver. After all, such mockery was born of prejudice towards her age.\nAnd if prejudice were something so easily overthrown, there would be no value in resisting it, would there?\nShe believes that rock 'n' roll is like a seed. After every performance, some seeds might sprout within the hearts of those adults who listen.\nWhen they wake up the next day, perhaps they might receive some inspiration, or perhaps a change of mood will come over them...\nEven if it only changes their thinking a little bit... Perhaps they might find that the real-life troubles they are facing are nothing but a storm in a teacup.\nOf course, few people other than her audience and the \"friends of rock\" would credit this to rock 'n' roll.\nBut people do nonetheless say this around the tables after tea.\n\"Well, having a girl who plays rock 'n' roll is pretty interesting, no?\"",
            "Xinyan's Instrument\tXinyan's main instrument is a hand-made guitar of a very unique design. She based it off the rock 'n' roll instruments that were imported from Fontaine before adding additional modifications based on personal understanding.\nFor example, she mounted a crescent-shaped axe-blade on the tail end of the instrument so it might serve as a weapon in a pinch.\nShe also connected it to her Vision, allowing it to spew flames and sparks. Its internals can also spew flame, all the better for it to self-destruct if it falls into the wrong hands, preventing its misuse...\nThe list of modifications goes on, and they are too numerous to count.\nThis instrument is thus unique, and its sound profile is also special.\n—Sorry, what? What do you mean, \"these modifications sound like they have nothing to do with music?\"\nSounds like you, too, need to attend one of her performances. You'll understand then.",
            "Vision\tXinyan was someone who never fit in in Liyue Harbor, and she only found where she belonged when she encountered rock 'n' roll.\nBut because she lived in a land that had no place for rock 'n' roll yet, she needed to be able to attract enough attention.\nShe immersed herself in the world of music, looking for a way to move people's hearts. She broke many an instrument and played till calluses formed on both hands, but still, it was unsatisfactory.\n\"Who'd want to listen to this racket?\"\nThe rotten-tomato reviews she received were starting to get to her. She wondered if she should quit.\nSitting on top of Mt. Tianheng, she looked down over Liyue Harbor. But though the lights lit the streets and alleys of the harbor, they could not light the flame of the spirit of rock 'n' roll.\nShe considered leaving, to go someplace where rock 'n' roll was appreciated. But would this not be running away? Would it not be a betrayal of rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance?\nNo, she would not leave. She would become a \"flame\" that could light Liyue Harbor up.\nShe started experimenting with the use of fire to move people, adding sparks and explosions to her music.\nBut this was no mean feat for an ordinary person.\nWho knows how many times she must have burnt her fingers or blown her instrument up. But still, she continued to practice every single day on top of Mt. Tianheng.\nAnd perhaps it was that the gods themselves had great expectations of this new form of music that would soon grace the seven nations...\nBut regardless, the boiling-hot Vision would be the final stroke of perfection.\nXinyan dashed down the mountain and began her very first rock 'n' roll concert in Liyue Harbor.\nThus did her musical journey begin, with showers of sparks and explosions keeping time."

            "Character Details\tThe head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine, descendant of Hakushin's lineage, Eternity's servant and friend, and the intimidating editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House, a publisher of light novels...\nCome to think of it, Yae Miko's nicknames are as myriad as her changeable moods.\nThe number of people who have tried to \"figure her out\" for various reasons could fill the streets from the Tenryou Commission estate to Yae Publishing House if you were to line them all up, but to this day, very few indeed have succeeded.\nNot that Miko has ever intended to conceal anything, of course. Any capriciousness is but the result of doing as she wills and pleases. A riddle with no solution is no riddle at all, in any case!\nYou just need to remember that she will always be none other than the wise and beautiful Yae Miko.",
            "Character Story 1\tYae Publishing House's editors once submitted a certain manuscript to the editor-in-chief.\nThis work was well-written, clearly thought out, and the themes were romance with a side of comedy — a prime slice of the zeitgeist.\nSuch a gem would surely require but a thin coat of polish and a few beautiful illustrations to sell well!\nBut unexpectedly, Yae Miko did not seem pleased with this, instead heaving a deep sigh before calling for the various head editors.\nOne of them asked hesitantly, \"Lady Yae, I... Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn't this the hot genre of the day?\"\nFaced with the editor's doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, \"not free enough.\"\nThings like \"top sellers,\" \"genre fiction,\" these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.\nGetting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?\n\"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well.\"\nUpon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany. Several months later, a new manuscript was sent to Miko and her editors.\nThe latter were stunned, and even Yae Miko, who cared little about taboos, furrowed her brows slightly — a rare sight indeed.\n\"Um... What do we do? This isn't good...\"\n\"Exactly! I mean, there's 'not being concerned about genre, and then there's something like 'Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden'... This is just too much!\"\n\"Hmm? Genre? No, no, there's no problem with that — it's his pen name I'm worried about. It's too normal for a book like this.\"\n\"Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind. As long as you're happy, Lady Yae.\"\nNot long after, the author of this book would take to the literary stage with the Yae Miko-approved (and overly long) pen name \"Kadenokouji Kenzaburou.\"\nAs to how the editor-in-chief got the idea to start a \"Reborn as Guuji Yae\" writing submission event, that would be a tale for another day.",
            "Character Story 2\tIf there was something inconvenient about being the Guuji, it is that she must attend every shrine ceremony, dressed up to the nines and in her proper place in the sanctuary.\nThe fireworks paint the night skies as they blossom, and the sounds of human merriment fill the shrine, and yet she must sit within, a solemn smile on her face...\nSuch tragedies are even more frightful to Miko than the possible wholesale disappearance of Fried Tofu from Teyvat.\nWith the somewhat longer span of years that the Electro Archon's servants have, a hundred years pass in the blink of an eye. As the years fly by, boredom becomes the greatest foe.\nAnd if even she were, archon-forbid, one day to accept sitting quietly still, obstinate as deadwood, would the world now sorely lack for another clever person adept at discovering fun and grasping opportunity?\nAs such, looking for fun things to do in every nook and cranny can only be the most reasonable and necessary course.\nAnd if she were to, say, utilize her authority as Guuji in making fun things happen — why, some things are unavoidable, are they not?\nOn the day of the festival, Guuji Yae would nod in satisfaction as she received a delivery of fireworks from the Yashiro Commission — of Naganohara construction and specially-made to boot.\nThat night's ceremony was, of course, performed with perfect respect to all etiquette and rites.\nThe sight of the \"Lady Guuji\" kneeling gracefully the whole night through would be the object of awe for all the other shrine maidens.\nIn the meantime, she would sit beneath the meteor shower of light adorning the skies, watching the festival-goers as they came and went.\nAnd the din of the fireworks covered the mumbling that came between teeth chewing on a candy apple.\n\"You know, when you asked me to become Guuji, you never mentioned that I'd only ever be able to sneak outside to watch the festivities from then on.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tPursuing fun and finding happiness is how Miko lives her everyday life.\nFor someone who enjoys studying humanity like her, \"perspectives\" and \"virtue\" play distant second fiddles to \"fun.\"\nEven a great shrine maiden of a different faith or an enemy general might pique her interest.\n...That said, this appreciation can sometimes lead to some innocuous trouble.\nAs opposed to those conscientious underlings or worshipful juniors, Miko's favorite person at the shrine is a shrine maiden named Kano Nana.\nYes, that Kano Nana, the novel enthusiast (just like Miko) who constantly frets over Sayu.\nWhile laying about indoors, Miko would often see Sayu flash past the window, followed not long after by a hurried and angry Kano Nana.\nLike lightning and thunder they were, which caught Miko's attention, to the point where she would even sometimes give wrong directions just to let the ruckus go on for a little longer.\nThere was another time when Sayu told Miko that the afternoon sun was the most pleasant after the latter had helped her steal some time for napping.\nPerhaps encouraged by these words, Miko would transform into an ordinary Inazuman lady on a wonderfully sunny afternoon, descend from the mountain and have a day out.\nThe Aisa Bathhouse in the city, Hanamizaka's Kiminami Restaurant, Ogura Textiles and Kimonos by the streetside... she did not miss a single store, and every one was an enjoyable experience.\nAnd in the evening, she was at Bantan Sango Detective Agency to tell them of a missing animals case that she had heard about on the way.\n\"But you really must help, good detectives. I mean, one can barely stand to watch those owners cry their eyes out as it is...\"\nHaving done all this, the lady could not help but let slip a pleased smile.\nTaking part in Inazuma's daily life in such an identity really was fun.\nWell, except that part where Kujou Sara shot her a suspicious glance as they passed each other by.\nRight, and also, she probably owed the boss of Aisa Bathhouse an apology — the outland-styled hot springs were indeed very good, but she might have accidentally shed some fox fur during the soak.",
            "Character Story 4\tA long, long time ago, humanity did not need to use the phrase \"a long, long time ago\" to preface tales about youkai.\nThe tengu dominated the skies, the oni swept across the battlefield, the tanuki were seen along small paths, and the kitsune walked amongst humans.\nUnder the banner of Narukami, the incredible powers of the youkai host were used to help humans through an era of strife and poverty.\nSeeking refuge in the mountains, they built a city by the sea, and so began Inazuma.\nAmongst the youkai, the lineage of Hakushin Kitsune was the most revered, and it was this great line that left a great many tales amongst humans.\nWhenever the youkai gathered to feast and sup together, a little braggadocio about how their latest exploits had become legend anew was very much a given.\nOf course, considering the amount they would drink, most tales told afterward would diverge a little from the truth. But no one minded, asking only that the tale be interesting. As time passed, this became known as \"hyakumonogatari daikai,\" or \"the great meeting of a hundred tales.\"\nIt was no uncommon sight to see Urakusai raise his cup and speak, holding all the other youkai spellbound with his story, drawing even smiles from Kitsune Saiguu, the organizer of the event.\nInstead it was Miko, who was then in the form of a young kitsune, who would perch on Kitsune Saiguu's shoulder and relentless peck at any loopholes in Urakusai's story.\nUrakusai, being a cool-headed and brilliant gentleman, would explain as he twirled his beard.\nBut Miko could always find something new to nitpick, and so they would go, back and forth, until Lady Saiguu would smile and call both parties to a halt: the audience wanted to hear the next part, after all.\nAfter another three rounds of drink and several more rounds of stories, the company would be hard-pressed to even string a sentence together, let alone a story.\nAnd so the gathered youkai would dispense with the word-fencing and use their powers to take to the skies to see who could best cover the sky and moon with their powers.\nAnd thus it was said that \"a hundred youkai shall parade upon a moonless night.\"\nFive hundred years on, that little kitsune has already become a mighty youkai in her own right.\nAs for the youkai who drank with them in those days, they disappeared amidst war and history, and their remaining bloodlines grow thinner by the day.\nAnd thus did their great parade, the Hyakkiyakou, become something that happened \"a long, long time ago.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe swords of Inazuma have always been famous the world over, and the best works of the Raiden Gokaden in particular are national treasures.\nHowever, only a short time ago, more than half of the five artisan lineages were cut off.\nA great number of powerful people were caught up in that conspiracy, and those responsible were all called to account and banished.\nEven the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was implicated due to their failure in supervising their subordinates...\nBut before the Shogun could give her final judgment, the Lady Guuji, who usually did not meddle in government affairs, suddenly interceded, rescuing the Kamisato Clan in their hour of peril.\nThus, while they suffered a serious blow, they were spared from dismissal.\nIn the years that followed, others would speculate greatly concerning the Guuji's actions.\nSome observed the close relations between the Yashiro Commission and the Grand Narukami Shrine, and guessed that she had intended to foster advocates loyal to her.\nAnd yet the shrine had always been an entity unto itself, and the Lady Guuji did not usually meddle in governance. Thus this action seemed a sacrifice greater than the reward — hardly a wise decision.\nSome others said that the Guuji suspected something to be wrong with the whole situation, and now that the list of those involved was so extensive, any major shakeup in the Yashiro Commission could destabilize Inazuma itself.\nThis thought, too, seemed reasonable on face, yet did not stand up to scrutiny. After all, was not the rise and fall of great houses merely ordinary in the grand scheme of mortal affairs? And even if the Kamisato were to fall from grace, new leadership for the Yashiro Commission would emerge.\nYet another story said that Miko engaged in secret talks with the Kamisato clan head just after the initial shockwaves had died down.\nBut the wounded clan was like a candle in the wind at this point. What power could they have to change the situation?\nTo this day, all these speculations have never amounted to anything, nor have any answers emerged concerning Miko's actions and motivations.\nBut what none know is how Miko's words that day would become as engraved into the Kamisato Clan as their house's crest.\n\"That the Kamisato Clan has survived this incident is only due to the Shogun's mercy. Do not forget this in the days that follow.\"\nThese words would serve as a seed of destiny, foreshadowing the Yashiro Commission's future position.\nIn some other time, if a storm were to descend upon Inazuma, and even if they were to come into conflict with the other two commissions, the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan would remember the favor they were shown and abide the Shogun's path to Eternity.\nThis was a move that the Guuji played with no regrets whatsoever.",
            "Fire-Soothing Festival Committee\tThe Fire-Soothing Festival Committee was once an organization chaired by the Tenryou Commission and managed by the Grand Narukami Shrine, whose remit was to pray for a lack of any fires in the coming year.\nIn those days, Inazuman houses were mostly made of wood, and any carelessness while handling fire could lead to disaster.\nThus, the Tenryou Commission was charged by the Shogun with setting up fire brigades to conduct rescues and damage control when fires did break out, and they also requested that the Grand Narukami Shrine set the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee up to comfort the frightened people.\nIn later years, anti-fire precautions would become second nature and serious cases would no longer occur often, but still the annual festival would remain.\nThe shrine maidens would dance elegantly, and the people would give generously... with the proceeds split forty-sixty between the Commission and the Shrine.\nWhen Yae Miko was faced with financial issues while attempting to start Yae Publishing House, she considered the various services that the shrine ran at the time before locking onto this ancient traditional committee.\n\"I mean, the busywork is solely done by the Grand Narukami Shrine, so why do we have to split the proceeds with the Tenryou Commission?\"\n\"What's more, all that Mora's just going into Kujou Senior's pockets. It's not like the fire brigade has ever gotten a year-end bonus or anything.\"\nAs such, after some preparation, the Fire-Soothing Festival of that year would be changed to no longer feature dancing shrine maidens but a grand, rollicking light novel submission contest.\nThe organizing body for this competition and any subsequent publications, the \"Yae Publishing House,\" would also \"borrow\" the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee's budget.\nAs for the profits? Into the shrine's coffers they went.\n\"Well, we no longer have many fires, and yet our budget keeps increasing. Thus, this restructuring relieves the financial burden placed upon the people.\"\n\"Also, the study of lore and the writing of literature and poetry is also a way of pleasing our Archon — surely you do not claim to know more of ritual and ceremony than I?\"\nThat was what Yae Miko said most solemnly to Kujou Takayuki when he came by unannounced.\nThe Tenryou Commissioner was ultimately forced to leave the way he came, stormy-faced, along with his attendants.\nLittle did any of them know that the moment they stepped out of the shrine, the somber Lady Miko would pluck a novel manuscript from the nearby offering box and continue annotating it.",
            "Vision\t\"That was a contest of magic for the ages!

            "Hello\tMy name is Yanfei, top legal expert in Liyue — and for the avoidance of doubt, no one else comes close! From commercial litigation, to civil mediation, to criminal lawsuits, I'm fully versed in every area of the law, and I guarantee you a swift and satisfactory conclusion to your case! My contact details... Where should I write this down? ...Hmm, paper will just get lost, and it'll only rub off if I write it on the back of your hand, so... Aha! I know, I'll just write it here, on the clothes of this... whatever this thing is that follows you around.",
            "Chat: The Law\tI'll remind you again: The law can be both a help and a hindrance.",
            "Chat: Work\tSometimes the law is compatible with human nature, but sometimes the two conflict. Balancing the two is a discipline in its own right...",
            "Chat: Reading\tThe case before us... is a strange and unprecedented one indeed.",
            "When It Rains\tRain! Oh, Lord of Geo, please, do us a favor and clear this up at your earliest convenience... I submit that we cannot afford for the codices to get damp...",
            "When It Snows\tWhat the... What kind of injurious weather is this!? It's c—cold... Achoo...",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tAh, this weather's got me in the mood for reciting some laws. Let's see... \"Commercial Law of Liyue,\" Chapter 27, Section 6, Article 3 stipulates that— Wait, what was it...? Oh my goodness, I've completely forgotten! What is wrong with me today...?",
            "Good Morning\tI have to head out this morning to meet a client about a creditor dispute, but I also have to follow up on a consultation from last week by noon... Alright, time to get to work!",
            "Good Afternoon\t*yawn* I'm a little sleepy... I know, a vigorous debate should wake me up! And I've got just the topic: \"The Northland Bank's presence in Liyue does more harm than good for our economy.\" ...So, are you for or against?",
            "Good Evening\tThe night market? Hmm... I was planning on organizing some files this evening, but if you're going, I can join you. Oh, I should mention — lots of vendors go for the hard sell in the evenings, because they want to be able to start with fresh produce the next day, but also don't want to lose profit on what they have left today.\nSo, leave the negotiating to me. And... If you have any leftovers, those can be my fee.",
            "Good Night\tNeed a cure for insomnia? Let me read you the history of the development of Liyue's legal system! None of my friends have ever lasted longer than 20 minutes... Oh, you want something more fast-acting? Then I'll recite from the legal codices! Let me know in the morning which section I got to before you fell asleep! Okay, here I go...",
            "About Yanfei: Atmosphere\tYou think I come across as quite imposing when I'm reading through case files? Huh. Well, that's only when I'm in work mode. It's like... I have an invisible switch, flick it one way and I'm in normal mode, flick it the other way and I switch to work mode. Surely you must have a switch like that, too?",
            "About Yanfei: Weakness\tCivil cases are the ones I dread the most. Divorces, custody disputes... It's a thankless task trying to unpack these kinds of cases with logic and reason. You have to be kind, courteous, and patient with your clients, even though half the time they are completely incapable of participating in a constructive discussion. *sigh* I know I advertise myself as being fully versed in every area of the law, but honestly, if it were up to me, I'd rather everyone could just get along, so we wouldn't have so many of these cases.",
            "About Us: Rates\tYou want legal advice from me? Sure. For legal opinions, I charge a flat rate of 6,000 Mora, for advisory services, my hourly rate is 180,000 Mora, and for commercial law, I charge 710,000 Mora per case — final quote and commission rate depending on the details of your case. Not a bad deal, right?",
            "About Us: Relationships\tIf you're concerned about what kind of complicated issues you might get tied up in during your travels, your best bet is to bring someone with you who knows and understands the law. Someone like me, for example, whose expertise goes beyond just the law of Liyue... Well, actually, having said that, Fontaine's law is notoriously complicated... Though, with my level of intelligence, getting acquainted with it should be no problem! Anyway... My point is, you can always rely on me!",
            "About the Vision\tVisions appear in response to strong desire, so as someone with ideals, it's only natural that I should have received one. Because, above all, I wish for all people to live honest lives and abide by the law. But some people will always insist on playing by their own rules and causing havoc for everyone else... Hah, those people can expect to be prosecuted so hard, they won't know what hit them!",
            "Something to Share: Balance\tThis steelyard balance was a gift from my father. It weighs objects to determine their value. I usually use Mora for the weight, but it can only give the original price. For example, a thousand years ago, Liyue was covered in Glaze Lilies, and they weren't worth anything in monetary terms. Then, when they suddenly declined in number, the price shot up in response, but the value shown by this steelyard wasn't updated. It still shows them as their original value... in other words, dirt cheap.\nSo, most of the time, this isn't a very useful tool for work purposes... Hmm? You want to try weighing something? How about... We could weigh your little friend here, will that do?",
            "Something to Share: The Rule of Law\tI have a self-defense method that I call \"Wrath of the Flame,\" based on a punishment called the \"Wrath of the Rock,\" which is detailed in the ancient work \"The Comprehensive Compendium of Liyue Law.\" The Lord of Geo is the God of Contracts, and contracts, too, can be seen as a way of restraining people. Haha, ergo, Liyue Harbor has been the City of Contracts since time immemorial.",
            "Interesting Things\tThe Historia Naturalis Liyue has an entry about a waterborne plant called the Horsetail. It claims that \"The Horsetail is a medicinal herb that stands alone on the banks of Dihua Marsh. Its color is that of the clouds at sunset.\" Apparently, if you grind it into a powder and mix it into your ink, it makes your writing water-resistant. But it's a shame, I've been to Dihua Marsh at least a hundred times, and each time I end up with baskets and baskets of the common purple variety, but not a single one of the kind that the book describes.",
            "About Qiqi\tI heard that little herb gatherer has written out a whole set of behavioral rules for herself. She may be small, but boy, has she got her head screwed on! She's definitely destined for greatness...\n\"The young of today shall outperform us tomorrow,\" as they say. I must admit, she has my respect.",
            "About Ganyu\tGanyu is kind and thoughtful, it's just a shame she's so busy all the time. Most of the time, she's buried in an endless pile of paperwork — the only exception being her nap at noon. Don't get me wrong, I have to put in some hours at work, too. But I'm happy with the job I've chosen, and it's certainly a lot less taxing than hers.",
            "About Xingqiu\tThe Feiyun Commerce Guild is one of my oldest clients. Their approach to business is meticulous and thorough, and every business meeting I've had with them has always been attended by the head of the house himself. Last time, though, I happened to meet their youngest, Xingqiu. To my complete surprise, the lad had no trouble whatsoever keeping up with my train of thought. He was very eloquent, too, and had excellent manners. Mm, definitely not a simpleton.",
            "About Hu Tao\tI always hear people saying that the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an unorthodox approach to business. They think she's gone a little non compos mentis after being in the funeral business so long... What are these people talking about? The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor provides a legitimate and necessary service, which is the cornerstone of any successful enterprise. Work is just work — there are no good and bad jobs, or lucky and unlucky jobs, just jobs that need doing.\nIf I had one gripe, it would be that the director rarely comes to me for legal advice, hmph...",
            "About Zhongli\tMr. Zhongli has so much in-depth knowledge on so many topics, he's like a walking library, you know what I mean? He's a total savant, though he never flaunts it. I could tell just by looking at him. People like him rarely shy away from taking on complex problems alone, so in my estimation he's certainly not a potential client.\nAnd yet, somehow, I can't help but think I know him from somewhere, it's hard to describe the feeling... I asked my father about it, and he just said something to the effect of he didn't know either, though he seemed a little evasive. It was so strange... Anyway, makes me wonder if my father is hiding something from me. Hmph, alright then — if he won't tell me what's going on, I'll just have to find out for myself...",
            "About Ningguang\tYou must have heard of the Tianquan, Ningguang? She's the highest authority where the law is concerned, and often makes amendments to the legal codices. Every round of additions, retractions, and revisions generates mountains of material. Why, the latest edition of the legal codices contained three new laws, 121 revised legal annotations, and an array of new legal precedents. Archons know how long it's going to take me to commit them to memory...\nHmph... still, she's a businesswoman at heart, I'm not about to let her beat me when it comes to the law. Once I've finished memorizing these, I need to step up my productivity...",
            "About Keqing\tThe Yuheng doesn't deal with matters of the law, and thank goodness... Knowing Keqing's attitude toward work and ruthless efficiency, I'd end up losing a lot of work. Although... No, surely it wouldn't come to that. She's a stickler for doing things the right way — no doubt she'd offend people... but if she had someone like me as her legal assistant... No way! Why should an eminent legal expert such as myself be relegated to the role of assistant!? If she needs legal counsel, she can come and find me.",
            "About Eula\tEula saved me once, and we've kept up correspondence ever since. She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all.",
            "About Yelan\tYelan is an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs — she once helped me crack a tough accounting fraud case. I treated her to dinner afterward. The only thing is... I feel like she's able to read my mind at any given moment when talking to her... Yes, in the future, I need to make absolutely sure I don't get on the wrong side of her.",
            "About Kuki Shinobu\tShinobu? I remember her, she's the Inazuman girl that came to Liyue as an exchange student to specialize in law. When she was doing her coursework, she used to meet with me to discuss some cases, and after we were done, she'd always bow and thank me, which would always make me a little embarrassed. I always felt like she was going to make an excellent lawyer in the future. Thinking about it, Inazuma went into lockdown right around the time she would have graduated. I wonder how she's been doing since she went back...",
            "More About Yanfei: I\tA client? Very pleased to meet you, here's my card. I'm afraid I can't leave my desk today, if it's a dispute we're dealing with then please bring the relevant parties here to see me. Let me just give you a breakdown of my fees — one moment...\nHuh? You came just to chat? Uh... no fee necessary then. So just to clarify... you came to chat as friends with a legal expert that you've never met before... care to explain?",
            "More About Yanfei: II\tThese antlers? Oh... well my father is an adeptus, so I have adeptus blood myself. Still, I was born during peacetime here in Liyue — I never signed a contract with Rex Lapis. Naturally, I don't have to concern myself with adeptal affairs — I'm free to focus on the life I want to live. Works for me! Hee-hee.",
            "More About Yanfei: III\tContracts of that magnitude — lifelong commitments... I've only ever signed one with my father. Uh... it's about living happily, I suppose. That's the kind of person he is. I'm proud of him for that. If he'd wanted me to sign a different contract, say... one about working myself into the ground, or stepping on others to achieve success... I would've ran away by now!",
            "More About Yanfei: IV\tSometimes, the commercial disputes I handle don't end very pleasantly. The other party might win compensation way in excess of the damages, or pay damages far exceeding the costs... Such is the price of violating a contract. Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern!\nThink about it — the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts. People are a lot less likely to violate contracts when they see the fallout. Making sure that people realize the importance of contracts is a crucial part of my work!",
            "More About Yanfei: V\tMost of the time, I feel that I have a happy and laid back existence. I have a successful career, clothes on my back, and the freedom to go wherever I please. I've also got quite a way with words — nobody can beat me in a debate. And yet, there is no law or standard that can define a happy life.\nFor me... interesting people and engaging affairs, knowing where to go and which path to choose... these are all enough to bring me happiness. And on that note, you too are a source of happiness for me.\nIn any case, whatever the life you live, the most important thing is to respect and understand the law. After all, as soon as you stray from the law, the world begins to fall to ruin.",
            "Yanfei's Hobbies\tMy hobbies are reading and appraisal. Reading begets knowledge, appraisal improves judgment. As such, I read everything and appraise anything. If you don't believe me, bring something over sometime. If there's a market for it, my estimate won't be far off. Take this stone for example... must be... 600 Mora.",
            "Yanfei's Troubles\tMy friends from the Communications Office often get me to go fishing with them. They say it's to exchange angling tips, but deep down everyone's keen to show off. I've gotten the better of everyone a hundred different ways, but they continue to scrutinize my business... After so much success, it's gotten a little embarrassing... So every time, I end up taking advantage of my ingenious acting skills to make myself seem humble, you know? What's with the face — are you doubting me?",
            "Favorite Food\tOh! On that note, let me recommend my one true love. Tofu — tofu all the way! Light in flavor, tender in texture, not to mention smooth and nourishing. It goes well with all manner of soups and dishes, and more importantly — it's available throughout the seasons! Beauty over complexity... tofu dishes are my kind of flavor.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI don't like cold dishes... maybe it's because I rarely eat them. When I would get home late, my father used to keep a lantern lit for me. He'd hear me coming and ask me if I was hungry. In his words: \"The best dishes are served hot.\"",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tTastes pretty great! Seems like you did your homework when it comes to the unwritten Law of Tofu.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tThere's a saying in Liyue: \"Food is life.\" I gotta admit, the supporting evidence is pretty compelling.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\t...I got it! I'll put it back on the fire for a bit, that'll do the trick.",
            "Birthday\tHappy birthday! Here, this is for you. I've collated legislation from all the nations — you're planning to go traveling, right? It will serve you well to familiarize yourself with the law of the different lands.\nDon't study too hard mind you, or else... I won't be of any use to you.",

            "Character Details\tLiyue is a port that prizes contracts and trade, and it is a place where wealth accumulates.\nMerchants from various nations are active here, which has contributed to Liyue's abundance, but has also brought up many disagreements. The Tianquan, Ningguang, has written a very comprehensive compendium of laws to deal with this, but not everyone has the patience to study them.\nThus was born the role of the legal adviser in Liyue society. Highly familiar with Liyue's laws, they help those in need to navigate any contradictions, earning recompense for their efforts.\nYanfei is the premier legal adviser in Liyue Harbor.\nShe is always able to obtain the most benefits for her clients, insofar as the law will allow. Some even call her \"the law that walks.\"\nBut in truth, what Yanfei — one of the few half-illuminated-beasts who have yet to sign a contract with Rex Lapis — really wants to do is live a free and happy life.\nAs for the copy of \"The General Law of Liyue\" that she carries around on her person, Yanfei has this to say:\n\"If you don't wish to be bound by the rules, you have to first understand them all.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tAs the most sought-after legal adviser in Liyue Harbor, Yanfei's rates are also top-of-the-line.\nEven so, she never lacks for people coming to seek appointments. After all, merchants are not stingy about mediation fees, but are very picky indeed about the mediator.\n\"Money is no object — we must have Yanfei come and settle this matter for us.\"\nMany rate Yanfei in this fashion, not only for her quick-thinking or her masterful oratory, but also because she very greatly emphasizes the cornerstone of the law — \"fairness.\"\nHer mediations often end in win-win situations, and even merchants with daggers drawn will temporarily set their prejudices aside.\nThough she is unbound by a contract, Yanfei has made her own contribution to the peace and prosperity of Liyue.",
            "Character Story 2\tAs a legal adviser, Yanfei does have her fair share of weaknesses. An example is the mediation of civil disputes that involve emotions and relationships.\nDivorces, inheritances, custody disputes, senior care, severances... The list continues.\nIt is said that upright officials are hapless in household affairs, and so it also is with Yanfei, who grew up surrounded by love — these matters fall right into her blind corner.\nSometimes, she will find that both sides have reason on their side, and other times she will find them to both be unreasonable. Child custody disputes are the absolute worst, as no matter how she settles them, the settlement will have a great psychological impact on the innocent children. Even if Yanfei chooses to soldier on, she will only tire herself out.\n\"Hopefully, everyone can meet the right person and be spared this particular grief.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tAs a result of her greatly tolerant nature, Yanfei has a wide variety of personal relationships throughout Liyue.\nThere is no need to worry about rubbing a sore spot, and you'll be able to get along with her whether you're an avid conversationalist or not.\nOf course, this is true as long as you don't attempt to debate with her or start a conversation about the legal profession... Yanfei in work mode is a completely different beast to deal with.\nAdditionally, Yanfei has cultivated the habit of being overly rigorous from her long years of studying the law. When chatting, Yanfei will vigorously eliminate any ambiguity or loopholes present in the discourse and can seem like a bit of a chatterbox. When she realizes this, Yanfei is wont to knock herself on the head with a book in irritation.\nHowever, so long as she constantly bathes in a sea of legal literature, this habit will probably be quite hard to break.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen investigating the law, Yanfei's habit is to look past the cold letters of the law to perceive their point of origin.\nAs such, she is also something of a master of \"reading comprehension\" in her relationships.\nOnce, the Traveler met Yanfei by chance and said, \"Huh. Didn't expect to see you here.\"\nThis should have been a line that one might hear just about anywhere, but it wound up holding a completely different meaning for Yanfei.\n\"Didn't expect to meet you here\" implied that the Traveler had at least thought about a scenario in which they would meet. Then why the use of \"didn't expect\"? One could only postulate that the Traveler had some expectation of where she might appear, and that her current location was not such a place. But whence came the expectation? Could it be that the Traveler had always been paying attention to her in secret?\n\"Does this mean that the Traveler...?\"\nYanfei tossed and turned in bed that night, unable to sleep.",
            "Character Story 5\tYanfei's most prized possession is the steelyard balance that her father gave her.\nIt is said that this balance was a treasure given by Rex Lapis that can be used to measure the value of all things. For convenience, Yanfei tends to use Mora to balance the scales, which is to say that she uses Mora to evaluate objects.\nThe prices of many objects have slowly changed over the years, but weighing an object with this balance only gives its value at the time Mora was created, leaving the rest to Yanfei to exercise her own wisdom and judgment.\nAcross the measurements of countless objects, Yanfei is able to see the changes in Liyue. Some objects that were once common have become vanishingly rare, and some exotic objects of the past have been rendered pedestrian today.\nThis steelyard balance reminds her that many things cannot be valued by the standards of the world.\nYanfei once tried to weigh the value of a Vision, but no matter how much Mora she added, the scales would not be balanced.\nIn frustration, she placed on the scale the box at her waist, which contained her heavy, handwritten legal notations. Only then did the weights at last even out.",
            "Codex Finalem\tThis is the most special of the many legal treatises that Yanfei collects.\nAs opposed to the codices that grow heavier and more complicated with time, this book is unbelievably light and thin.\nAfter opening it and getting past the prologue, one will find naught but the most basic few principles of the law inscribed.\nAs Yanfei sees it, this is the final form of the law. In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world. The halls of judgment will lie empty and the mountains of legalese shall be caked in years of dust.\nThough this may sound like something very far off, for someone like Yanfei, in whom flows the blood of an illuminated beast, living till that day is hardly a great accomplishment.\n\"Hmm, but if I think about it more deeply, I'd be out of a job then, wouldn't I?\"\nAfter encountering one of Xinyan's performances by chance, Yanfei was quite taken by this new wave of performance art.\nThat said, learning an instrument from scratch proved to be a bit difficult, so after consulting a great many resources, Yanfei came to what she considered to be a decent backup plan.\nIf such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper.\nFor someone who can recite tens of thousands of words' worth of Liyue law from front to back within an hour, speed at least should be no challenge.",
            "Vision\tYanfei's father is an illuminated beast, while her mother is an ordinary mortal merchant. Born into peaceful times, Yanfei did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis, but instead has one with her parents to \"live happily.\"\nAs Liyue's leading legal exegete, she is no stranger to exploiting some existing loopholes in the law — at times for herself, and sometimes for others.\nIt has been made clear often enough that Yanfei is not a stickler for the rules and has no wish to be shackled by strictures.\nStill, she contributes to the betterment of Liyue as she seeks her own pleasure, and will not use these loopholes for ill.\nWhen making amendments to legal loopholes each year, Ningguang the Tianquan will often study Yanfei's doings, as if she were Liyue's unofficial legal troubleshooter.\nIn a sense, one could argue that Yanfei makes the laws better at the lowest possible price... This principle is also the reason why she has never been convicted of exploiting any such loopholes.\nYanfei believes in \"no structure without laws,\" and what she wishes for is to \"live as one pleases without overstepping.\"\nEveryone in Liyue, adeptus or mortal, protects it in their own way.\nThat is why Yanfei possesses a Vision, one that is of equal weight to her principles."

            "Hello\tHello, I'm Yaoyao, a lowly disciple of the adeptus, Streetward Rambler. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance! If you encounter any difficulties outdoors... then lemme help you! Oh, by the way, I brought some Fried Radish Balls with me, help yourself! Don't eat too many, though — too much oily stuff is hard work for your body. If you're still hungry, I also brought a freshly washed radish and some vinegar, so I could make you a shredded radish salad if you want~",
            "Chat: Proverbs\t\"Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today!\" C'mon, let's get a move on!",
            "Chat: Join In the Fun\tOoh, what's happening over there? Can we take a sneaky peek, huh? Can we?",
            "Chat: Adepti-Seeking\tWhy do so many people make such a big deal out of \"seeking the adepti\"? There's adepti everywhere! Isn't there?",
            "When It Rains\tHey, can you hear the frogs croaking? Hehe, silly frogs! They're singing along to the sound of the rain! Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit~",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tWh—Whaa! I—I'll cover your ears for you, a—and if you're scared, you can hold my hand.",
            "When It Snows\tIt's snowing, yay! Uh! First things first: You have to wrap up warm. Put your big fluffy coat on... uh-huh, and your woolly hat and scarf, yep— Ah-ah-ah! Don't forget your gloves. ...Good! Alright, let's go build a snowman!",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tThe weather's so nice. Let's go have a walk around the harbor!",
            "When the Wind Is Blowing\tOoh, it's getting windy. Be careful not to get blown away.",
            "Good Morning\tTime to get up! Your breakfast is ready, so you'd better hurry... Uh, huh? You still wanna snooze a while? ...Well, okay — but five minutes and that's all, okay? Five minutes, and I'll be back to wake you up again. *sigh* I knew I should have sent you to bed earlier...",
            "Good Afternoon\tNow, don't forget: You don't wanna nap right away after a big lunch, but you also mustn't go racing off on an adventure. You gotta wait for your food to go down, or you'll get a tummy-ache.",
            "Good Evening\tHuh? You're going out again tonight? Hmm, what time do you plan on getting back? *sigh* Well, it's dark out, so be really careful...",
            "Good Night\tTime for your bedtime story... Now, where did we get to last t—time... Ah, yes: \"Ever since ancient times... the mighty and illuminated adepti have protected Liyue against evil. Among them, mmngh mmph...\"",
            "About Yaoyao: The Liyue Docks\tYou know the docks in Liyue Harbor? There's always loads of people talking, shouting, laughing, it's great! Totally different from back home. It's so quiet there, you can hear the leaves falling on the grass. That's why I go to the docks whenever I'm free — you know, to see the new ships, new sights... and new toys!",
            "About Yaoyao: Eat Up, Wrap Up\tThey say \"Give them clothes to wear, and they shall show you decency; fill their stomachs with grains, and they shall fill their minds with righteousness\"... And that's why you have to eat a decent meal and dress right for the weather when you're out in the wild. ...Huh? Is that not what that saying means? Oh, okay, so... what DOES it mean?",
            "About Us: Polearm Training\tIt's not that I'm lazy, it's just the spear's too long for me, and it's so heavy that training with it is really hard work... Luckily, Master doesn't push me too hard.",
            "About Us: Worries\tHave you been eating three meals a day? Also, do you have enough warm clothing? This cold spell's only going to get colder, you know. And anyway, are you sure it's not dangerous, adventuring all the time? Any new injuries I should know about? ...Ugh, you know what — forget that, just bring me along from now on. I can't have peace of mind knowing that you're out there braving the elements all day long...",
            "About the Vision\tMy Master's a Mighty and Illuminated Adeptus! She once told me that getting a Vision is a sign that the gods are pleased with you, but I don't think I've done anything special... I really wish I could talk to that god and see what she thinks about it!",
            "Something to Share\t\"Osial\"? Oh, you mean that jumbo-sized octopus from the Sea of Clouds? Uh... not because I wanna eat it or anything, but... if you guys wanted to, you should definitely cook it through on the grill first... Oh, wait! I mean, you don't HAVE to grill it, but... I just think it would taste better that way...",
            "Interesting Things\tI love finches! Whenever I go to play with Qiqi, I look out for them on my way there. And when I find them, I say hi! ♪ *whistle*~ ♪ ...Yep! \"Good morning!\" That's exactly what it means, well done!",
            "About Xiangling\tXiangling hasn't been, um... looking for strange ingredients lately, has she? She gave me a real fright last time. She said she was about to try some raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds. One of these days, she'll give herself an upset stomach — then what's she gonna do? 'Cause she definitely doesn't like taking Dr. Baizhu's medicine... Anyway, I got Master to try and talk some sense into her, too. Who knows what dangerous thing she'll be trying to eat next... *sigh*",
            "About Qiqi: Friends\tQiqi's my best friend! She forgets who I am sometimes, but I know she doesn't mean it... I just have to remind her to check her notebook, and she remembers me right away.",
            "About Qiqi: Forever\tI once asked Dr. Baizhu in private if there's any way to cure her, and, um... But it doesn't matter. I'll probably have to keep reminding her who I am for my whole life, but that's okay.",
            "About Baizhu\tDr. Baizhu's prescriptions are pretty effective. They're bitter, that's for sure, but they always say that about medicine: \"the bitter the better\"! So I get it. Huh? Too bitter for you? Don't worry, I've got some Candied Dates here. One of these after you finish your medicine will take the taste away.",
            "About Ganyu\tGanyu always has a lot of work to do. I heard that one time, she was so tired she accidentally fell asleep on the grass. *sigh* I do worry about her, you know! Hmm, maybe... we could go do a \"surprise inspection\"! You know, check in and make sure she's taking care of herself. Oh! Uh... Wait a minute, I'll go get some of her favorite plants for her to eat...",
            "About Keqing\tKeqing's a very thoughtful person, and she always does a good job of everything. She also makes sure to pay Master a visit at every festival... She's what you call a \"bastion of piety.\" Or wait, maybe it's \"paragon of propriety\"? ...Well, anyway, I think I can learn a lot from her!",
            "About Yun Jin\tNow, Yun Jin's really good at spear dancing, and her Liyue opera performances are very popular. Master even takes me to go see them sometimes. You won't find an empty seat when she's on stage... but, um... does anyone understand what she's singing about?",
            "About Beidou\tBeidou's ship is amazing! If I hadn't promised Ganyu that I wouldn't go on board anymore, I know exactly where I'd set up my own little bed, hee-hee.",
            "About Shenhe\tShenhe's been away from the human world for years and years, so it's no wonder that she's still adjusting to life in Liyue Harbor. I'd love to help Ganyu take care of her... But how do I ask her in a way that won't make her feel uncomfortable?",
            "About Yanfei\tYanfei takes that huge legal codex everywhere, even when she comes to pay Master a visit on her days off. She's incredible! I don't know how she carries that heavy thing around all the time, and I can't imagine how much hard work it must be to read it...",
            "About Xianyun\tWhen I went to look for Master the other day, I found her chatting with a very elegant-looking lady. She said her name was \"Xianyun,\" but her hijinks didn't fool me! I could tell it was Aunty Cloud Retainer right away! I mean, Master looked like she was really happy to see her, so how could it be a stranger? Evidently, she was an old friend!",
            "More About Yaoyao: I\tYou wanna know where I'm from? Well, my parents are hermits who live up in the mountains... Uh, I guess you could say that I'm from Qingce Village?",
            "More About Yaoyao: II\tMy family makes a living by growing precious medicinal herbs. My parents often get so busy that they forget about the housework, and sometimes they even forget to eat! Tsk, isn't that awful? Good thing they've got me to look after them.",
            "More About Yaoyao: III\tI grew up in the mountains, so the flowers, trees, plants, and animals are all my friends! Oh — would you like to chat with the finches? I can take you to them, and I can also help translate for you. Come on, it'll be fun~! But first, let's get some grains as a gift for them.",
            "More About Yaoyao: IV\tThere are adepti everywhere in Liyue. I've met loads of them! Aunty Cloud Retainer, Uncle Mountain Shaper... But Aunty Cloud Retainer's my favorite! She's given me all kinds of adepti gadgets, and taught me all about how to use them. I've learned so much from her!",
            "More About Yaoyao: V\tAfter I met Master, she said that the path of my fate had intersected with the adepti way, and took me on as her disciple. To be honest with you, I didn't even understand what she meant by that. But it's been so much fun, getting to hang out with everybody, listening to Master tell stories, and sneakily slacking off with Xiangling... And we also get to help the people of Liyue Harbor out a lot. I really love it!",
            "Yaoyao's Hobbies\tIt is said that joy hides just beyond the horizon, and bliss is as fleeting as the setting sun! So, whenever I notice anything fun going on, I always gotta go check it out... and you never know, maybe I'll find something I can help with.",
            "Yaoyao's Troubles\tOof, spear training is really kinda boring... Maybe I'll go play with Yuegui for a little bit, then come back and do some more training after I've had a break...",
            "Favorite Food\tQingce Stir Fry, Come and Get It, boiled fish... Lots of Liyue dishes are not only delicious, they also turn mealtimes into a big event. Hmm? You like them too? That's great! You'll have to come over for dinner sometime, I'll cook for you! Don't worry, I've helped Xiangling in the kitchen before, so it's safe to say that I come from good stock where food is concerned!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tOne time, Shenhe ate too many Qingxin in one go and she was sick for days! And that's why I've got to take care of myself and not eat raw Qingxin. Hmm? How did I know about that? Aunty Cloud Retainer told me!",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tThis is amazing! It tastes just like Xiangling's cooking. It's like they say: The apple didn't fall far from the tree, mmm... Wait, no, two peas in a pod! You two are like two peas in a pod. Hehe, I'm always mincing up my words when I get too excited.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tSooo tasty! Next time you cook, lemme come too! I can help~",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\t...Uh, do you always eat this kind of stuff? Maybe you should let me cook for you instead! If you're not eating well and you're still going out adventuring every day, one of these days you're gonna wear yourself out...",
            "Birthday\tThis is the day of your birth, and as is tradition, this calls for a bowl of longevity noodles. I got Xiangling to teach me how to make it, and I managed to put all the noodles in the water without breaking a single one! I also put a big plump egg in there, hee-hee! Come on, let's go, you've got to eat it before it goes cold. Wishing you a happy, healthy birthday and a long and prosperous life.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tEh? Did my spear just get lighter? ...It'd be great if it could get a little shorter, too...",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tWow! I might even be able to lift Xiangling's spear now! Yay~ Oh, I really wanna tell Master the good news!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tHehe, people always say \"perseverance is a virtue,\" and I guess I know what they mean now! ...Hmm? \"Patience is a virtue\"? But... isn't patience the enemy of progress?",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tHuh. So that's what it feels like to be fussed over... Well, any growing or changing I've done is all thanks to you! And you know what they say — \"treat other people the way you want them to treat you.\" So it's my turn to keep you safe and sound now!!",

            "Character Details\tThe adepti faithfully adhere to the contract that they have with Rex Lapis, and have thus defended Liyue for millennia.\nWhen danger arises in Liyue, the adepti are sure to come forth, and they do show up from time to time when the land is at peace.\nSometimes, they do so to punish those who harbor evil in their hearts, and sometimes they intervene to save the imprisoned. And if they happen to meet someone with a destiny intertwined with that of the adepti way, they will take them as disciples and teach them their arts.\nAmongst the adepti, Streetward Rambler is among those who interact more with mortals.\nShe has a great many disciples, the youngest of whom is named Yaoyao.\nYaoyao is both talented and inquisitive, and while she is still very young, thus limiting her ability to fully take in what she has been taught and causing no small amount of innocuous mistakes in the process, she will in time become a most knowledgeable girl.\nShe also possesses a gentle and caring nature, and she treats people with earnestness and generosity. Not only does her master favor her, but her senior disciple and other elders in her life, too, very much dote on her.\nMost will never have the fortune to enter the adepti abodes in Jueyun Karst, but Yaoyao comes and goes between them both freely and often. Indeed, the love she receives from the adepti at her young age is quite an enviable matter.",
            "Character Story 1\tAs the people of Liyue Harbor see it, Madame Ping is often found with Yaoyao by her side, the two seeming the very image of a loving grandmother and granddaughter.\nIn truth, however, there is no blood relation between them, and Yaoyao is Madame Ping's — or should we say Streetward Rambler's — disciple.\nWhen Yaoyao first became the adeptus' disciple, she was still too young to have learned to read and write, and so her master began by teaching her the etiquette of tomes of poetry on a daily basis.\nAs she grew, Streetward Rambler would gradually add the rites of the adepti, their methods of self-cultivation, and her own spear arts into Yaoyao's curriculum.\nThe voluminous nature of such teachings makes committing them to memory a challenge for Yaoyao, but her master does not overly fret about such things, for it is apparent to her that Yaoyao has indeed listened to those lessons.\nWhile her spear's shaft is heavy and ill-aligned to a child's easy wielding, Yaoyao practices every day nonetheless.\nAnd while books of poetry might be hard to memorize, she reads them daily nonetheless, to the point where she can expound on the relationship between full stomachs and righteousness in her sleep.\nHaving initially resolved to be a sterner taskmistress, Streetward Rambler was relieved to see Yaoyao's earnest attitude, and thus relaxed her requirements a little.\nThat Yaoyao genuinely treated her as her grandmother warmed the cockles of her heart greatly as well.\nIndeed, despite being half the height of an adult, Yaoyao tended to Streetward Rambler's meals and fretted over her health when the hotter parts of the year give way to the cold, as if forgetting that headaches and fevers were not common problems for the adepti.\nIndeed, Streetward Rambler came to feel as if she really had been blessed with a granddaughter, and from then on, she never said a strict word to the child ever again.\nWhile she had not begun this relationship with any intention apart from taking a disciple, she now finds herself and Yaoyao inseparable. Which is alright, she supposes. Let the little one stay by her side for some time yet — she still has much to teach, after all.",
            "Character Story 2\tThis story begins well before Yaoyao was even born. Her parents, preferring life out in the mountain wilds, chose to move away from Liyue Harbor and search for a quiet place near Qingce Village to live, building their own abode and living life in relative seclusion.\nThere they lived in solitude by the mountains and waters, and their backyard had a small field in which they grew melons, fruits, and vegetables.\nThe closest settlement to them was Qingce Village, and when they lacked for any daily necessities, they would bring the fruits of their field to the village and trade for what they required.\nThis was the home to which Yaoyao was born.\nThus did she gain the birds, beasts, and fish for companions while she was still a babbling babe, and thus did she take her first tottering steps in the radish field behind her house.\nHer gentle, pure soul was first cultivated in this quiet and cozy garden.\nLater, she would catch the eye of an adeptus and be taken in as her disciple.\nAt first, her parents were not entirely willing to let their daughter live long-term in Liyue Harbor with said adeptus, for they feared that their innocent daughter, having long been used to life in the mountains, would find herself led astray by the bright lights of the big city.\nBut Streetward Rambler's counsel ultimately brought them round:\n\"Perhaps solitude in the mountains shall indeed keep one from mortal stain, but such lonesomeness may not be what Yaoyao desires for her future. Let her have the chance to see the myriad faces of the world for herself.\"\nOnly then did her parents give her into the care of the adeptus, and time has only demonstrated the wisdom of that choice.\nIn Liyue Harbor, Yaoyao would become a much more outgoing person with the help of her master and a host of good friends. But when the festive season comes along, she does take leave of her master to see her parents at home.\nIndeed, if one desired a good teacher for one's child, could there be a more ideal pick than an adeptus?",
            "Character Story 3\tMadame Ping's old acquaintances will sometimes drop by to visit her, and during such times, Yaoyao will accompany her master and her master's guests in roaming the city.\nHaving come from afar, these guests will often not only visit the stores and food stands, but also attend storytelling sessions or Liyue opera performances at Heyu Tea House.\nOf course, being the large city that it is, Liyue Harbor has no lack of people who enjoy spending some downtime at the teahouse, including many outlanders who appreciate the cultures of other nations.\nOnce, three outlanders, first-time visitors to Liyue Harbor, sat at the table beside that of Yaoyao and company. Having heard an opera about the adepti of Liyue, they began to discuss that very topic over tea and snacks.\nUnable to get a word in lengthwise in the conversation between her master and her guest, Yaoyao succumbed to boredom, listening in on the nearby chat while eating some treats.\nThe lady from Inazuma seemed to think that Liyue's adepti were not much different from the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, having charge over matters divine and literary alike.\nThe visitor from Fontaine was of an obdurate view that the adepti were in the employ of the state apparatus. Had he met Ganyu, the Qixing's secretary before? Or did that nation simply have a similar arrangement?\nThe adventurer from Mondstadt was for his part very taken with the legends of the adepti, for he had only heard the bards sing songs of the gods, but had never himself met one or any of their familiars.\nUnable to resist, he asked the tea master if they had ever spoken to an adeptus, only to be disappointed by the reply:\n\"It is but a story, for we mortals do not daily dwell in Jueyun Karst, and few are the opportunities to meet the adepti.\"\nYaoyao, finding this statement to be incorrect, could not help but rebut thusly: \"That's not true. The adepti are among us. I mean, Uncle Moon Carver just said that the story was very interesting.\"\nFor some reason she could not fathom, Madame Ping's guest stopped speaking altogether, and Madame Ping laughed, saying a few words to the tea master to change the topic.\nYaoyao, however, did not understand: Why did people find the adepti very distant from their daily lives? The adepti were amongst them — they just didn't readily reveal themselves, that's all.",
            "Character Story 4\tNot all people can be accepted and taken as disciples by the adepti — only those whose destinies are entwined with these blessed beings may become privy to their arts and ways.\nYaoyao once asked her master: \"Why do you say that our destinies are entwined? What does that mean?\"\n\"It means that you and I have things in common that led to our meeting.\"\nThis answer, of course, was akin to some overarching axiom in a book, crushing much meaning into very few words, and has by no means been easy for Yaoyao to wrap her head around.\nYaoyao remembers that she had been playing in the mountains as usual when she first met her master.\nAt that time, she was still living with her parents, and when she went out to play, she would speak to the stones and the clouds about her feelings. In her eyes, the flowers, birds, fish, insects, and the mountains, rocks, and rivers were all her precious playmates.\nThat day, however, the stones and the clouds replied when she spoke, and thus overjoyed, she chatted with them throughout the entire day.\nThen the adeptus recalled her mystical arts, and the illusory stones and clouds dissipated, revealing Streetward Rambler to Yaoyao in her true form — and yet, Yaoyao was not startled.\nIt is the adepti way to protect the world and the people who live in it, and the adepti of Liyue do not merely defend humanity, but cherish also the things of nature. All such things are bound within their own natural cycles, and so long as one acts in concert with these cycles, all things will grow in their time and will not encroach upon one another.\nYaoyao's treasuring of her playmates bore similarity indeed to the adepti and their care for all things, and it was this that drew Streetward Rambler's interest.\nShame, then, that Yaoyao could not for the life of her comprehend the complexities of her master's reply, and thus did she lay the question aside for the time being.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter following her master to live in Liyue Harbor, Yaoyao has packed her daily schedule to the very gills. Her mornings are for readings and lessons, afternoons are for spear training, and afterward, it is time for single-minded play!\nPlay, her master said, is not to be underestimated, and for a child like Yaoyao, learning and play are both right and proper things to do.\nIt has been during play time that she has encountered all manner of people, among them the captain of the Crux Fleet, the doctor at Bubu Pharmacy, and his little herb-gathering assistant. As such, she has been steadily gaining a larger pool of people to ask about anything she may encounter that she might not immediately understand.\nShe also loves to explore the harbor area: Granny Shan's toy stall, the establishment — that is to say, Wanmin Restaurant — run by her senior disciple's family, the dockyards... If it may be explored, she would love to explore it.\nAs such, she has seen many things that books cannot tell of, such as the sails of embarking ships rippling in the wind, or the full map of Liyue that may be found in Yujing Terrace — each one of these helps her perceive the vastness of the world around her.\nSometimes, her idea of play will take her alongside her master to visit the Jueyun adepti. There she has heard many an ancient tale, and there she has learned that the truth of the past is far more perilous than any tomes may tell.\nEach day, she learns a little something more, and each day, things change all around her — nothing remains quite the same as it once was in life.\nThis is her favorite thing about Liyue Harbor.\nLife here is like a long river, constantly moving forward at a great pace.\nBy contrast, the days she spent with her parents are like a peaceful, quiet stream. The stream is wonderful, of course, and its gentle tread and slow rhythm has given her a great many warm memories.\nThe great river is also good. She will take up its unceasing drive and work hard to become an adult who both her master and parents can be proud of.\nAnd so wishing, she grows expectant, wishing to grow up.",
            "Yuegui\tStreetward Rambler has acquaintances all across Liyue, and even early on, she had paid many of them a visit, saying that her newest disciple's training was not quite complete yet, and asking them to take care of the young girl should they encounter her.\nHer original intention was simply to introduce her student and ask that they help teach Yaoyao further, that her eventual learning might increase.\nYaoyao's clever and caring manner, however, proved more lovable than Streetward Rambler had expected, and Cloud Retainer would take the request to heart.\nBefore either master or pupil had realized it, Cloud Retainer had already completed the creation of a wondrous machine rabbit.\n\"Well then, Yaoyao, one purposes to give this to you. Should you encounter any danger, call upon it, and it shall answer.\"\nYaoyao was very taken with this cute rabbit, naming it Yuegui and taking it everywhere with her.\nHaving given this gift, Cloud Retainer would seek out the little girl's master to say, and not without pride, that:\n\"One should inform you first that this device has another function. Should you ever be unable to find Yaoyao, you need only call out, 'Yuegui!', and her location shall be made known to you.\"\n\"Nonetheless, one counsels you not to overuse this feature, for when the child grows older, she will desire her own privacy, and may yet take umbrage to your constant calling upon her. Now, take one's loose relationship with one's pupil Shenhe for example...\"\n\"Oh, not to worry. I understand, Cloud Retainer.\"\n\"And it is good that you do. In any case, Yuegui shall alert us if anyone should try to do her ill without our knowledge — any such churls shall soon need all the luck they can get.\"",
            "Vision\t\"Why did I receive a Vision?\"\nThis question troubled Yaoyao quite a bit in the days that directly followed her receiving one.\nDid the gods want to reward her for the good deeds she had done? Or was this because she had been a good and respectful pupil?\nSpeaking of which, her senior Xiangling and Aunty Cloud Retainer's student Shenhe both had Visions as well. So, was this because the gods recognized the adepti, and so they would, as a matter of course, also extend this acknowledgment to an adeptus' students?\nBut on further consideration, none of these guesses really made much sense.\nIt was with a sigh that Yaoyao found herself sitting on the slopes behind Liyue Harbor, hugging a dog that had followed her up the incline.\nThis was hardly the first thing she had found incomprehensible since leaving her parents' side, and she had, by and large, decided that her doubts were unavoidable, and could wait till she got older, for surely they might clear up by then!\nBut since she now had a Vision, an item that represented divine acknowledgment, she could not betray such hopes.\nAs a disciple of her master, she would follow her example and protect the people. This meant that she would not only have to care for her master and senior disciple, but also extend care to her family and friends, and extend universal love to all people. Ah, she still had such a long way to go. Nothing for it, then — she'd hang on for a bit longer during spear practice tomorrow, and write one extra page into her calligraphy copybook too."

Obviously, most civilians have never heard the name Yelan before. So you can safely laugh off all these rumors.",

When it comes down to it, we're friends, and if somebody ever conned you, I'd feel like I'd been cheated, too.",

It doesn't matter how big or reliable the team under you may be, you can never completely rule out the risk. The bottom line is, have enough force at your fingertips to control the situation. I got lucky — I got my Vision just a few days after realizing that. Otherwise... you'd probably be talking to a very disheveled-looking ghost right now.",

            "About Ningguang: Relationship\tI got to know Ningguang a long time ago, before she was a Qixing, and we worked together for a while. Maybe I'm partly to thank for the fact that she became a Qixing so quickly. Hehe, who can say? Anyway, she was the one who recommended this job to me. It was a good choice, I'm very well-suited to it.",
            "About Ningguang: Expectations\tNingguang is good to work with. But I have to be mindful of our identities when I'm out in public. When I meet a Qixing as an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, they're \"Sir\" or \"Lady\" to me.",

            "About Keqing\tI don't really like people who cram their schedules full, because it doesn't leave any room for negotiation.

She works in a very methodical way. I always enjoy working with her.",

Whenever I help her out, I always get some invaluable leads in return. I gotta say though, sometimes I think she respects me a little too much.",
            "About Xiao\tThe elders in my clan once said that we must always show the utmost respect to the Vigilant Yaksha. Apparently, the only time that our ancestor would gain some temporary relief from his insanity was when passing by the Wangshu Inn. It must have been the comforting effect of his presence that wards off evil spirits. That said, if I ever have the honor of fighting side by side with the Conqueror of Demons, I will focus only on the mission. I cannot let myself be distracted by concerns about his status.",
            "About Xiangling\tAh, Xiangling, the lovely little chef. Her ingredients are always top quality, easily as good as Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk. Sometimes I go to her for dried Jueyun Chilis... She doesn't seem to understand why I eat them in the way that I do, and I don't feel like trying to explain it to her, either. It's just a family tradition.",

            "About Tartaglia\tThe Fatui harbinger? He helped me out once — unwittingly. I was planning a deep-reaching investigation into the former owner of the Yanshang Teahouse, but our harbinger friend got to him first. He showed up demanding payment of his debt, and also exposed his accounting fraud, which got him thrown in jail. That made it very easy for me to take over Yanshang Teahouse myself, and it's proven to be a very useful base.",

            "More About Yelan: II\tExchanging information has to be a two-way thing, so I guess I can tell you something about my past. Thanks to my family's connections, I learned some useful skills from the Millelith scouts very early on. Although there are things working against you every step of the way when you're gathering intelligence, as long as I keep myself alive, I'll always emerge as the winner in the end...",
            "More About Yelan: III\tClues are links in a chain. You have to trace them all the way back to where everything began before there can be a resolution. To that end, I need to keep my eyes and ears on every part of society, and often, that means having to be more than one person. People sometimes describe me as \"one person, many faces\" and so on... I take it as a compliment.",
            "More About Yelan: IV\tSomeone once warned me to be careful about digging up certain things from the past. Dig too deep and you might find yourself standing in your own grave, they say... Well, I'm not about to stop, least of all because of anything anyone else has to say. Sure, I can't change the facts, but if it's a choice between the cold, hard truth and blissful unawareness, I'll take the former. What about you? Which would you choose?",
            "More About Yelan: V\tTell me something. If I'm gonna stay around, what kind of person do you want me to be to you? Someone you work with? A competitor, who challenges you to sharpen your game? Just another name on your long list of acquaintances, or... somebody more important than that? Depending on what you're hoping for, I can either play that part or become that person.",
            "Yelan's Hobbies\tIn my free time, I live life completely at random. It's quite simple: I make a list of things to do, then I roll the dice to decide which one I'm going to do next. It's a surprisingly fun game, and it's really broadened my mind... in that sense, it's been quite helpful where my job is concerned.",
            "Yelan's Troubles\tMy physical fitness isn't actually that great compared with some trained martial artists. It's a hereditary thing that runs in my family. So before getting into really important work, I adjust my schedule to make sure I get enough rest, wait till I have built up enough energy, then strive to finish everything that needs doing in one go. Outside of work, I try my best to live life at a calm and carefree pace. So I'll always decline to take on any strenuous physical labor.",
            "Favorite Food\tI like to grind dried Jueyun Chilis and Violetgrass stamens into powder, mix them in with some Yunlai White Tea leaves, and then brew a strong pot of tea. It has the most powerful fragrance that makes you instantly fall in love with it. I prefer drinks like this with a long-lasting aftertaste to things like coffee and spirits.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tYou have to be very careful with sweets. That powerful sense of satisfaction... it weakens your willpower and makes you relaxed. It only takes a few bites to get addicted, and with long-term consumption, you'll slowly but surely lose your edge.",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tHm, not bad. Almost good enough to bribe me with.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tOnce you get accustomed to spicy food, everything else tastes bland. That's just the way it is.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tShall we roll some dice? Whoever gets the lowest number... gets to eat it.",
            "Birthday\tIf I was to tell you that maybe you shouldn't celebrate too hard today, because you'll let your guard down, and someone out there might just be waiting for that moment to make their move on you... it probably wouldn't go down very well. So, relax and take it easy today. Oh, and you should stop by the Yanshang Teahouse — I whipped up some treats especially for you. Not sweet ones, of course. Just the tiniest little hint of chili.",

            "Character Details\tLiyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs is an organization marked by transparency — from ordinary staff members of the Eight Trades to prominent officials of Yujing Terrace, every employee has their basic information documented in the Ministry's lists.\nYelan, despite claiming to work for the Ministry, is the sole exception. Most of her colleagues have never heard of her, nor is her name anywhere to be found on any rosters.\nThis does say something about her character — elusive, enigmatic, and erratic.\nShe is a ghost who walks in the middle of many crises under various names. But before the storms can come to an end, she has already disappeared without a trace.\nSometimes, she will pick a side in some conflict to offer her help, but those who receive her aid would be fools to celebrate prematurely, for they soon find that the same help has been extended to their opponents.\nHaving stepped into her trap, many have vowed to take revenge, yet none are able to tell what she is planning, let alone know where she stands.\nMany believe that she is a spy who works for some mysterious organization, and that her forte is stirring things up in the dark, which she then relies on to attain what she wants.\nSome even go as far as saying that she is a frenetic follower of disorder who neither serves any organization nor holds any meaningful purposes.\nEven if she does, all she wants is to add fuel to the already spreading flame and drag everyone down into a world of madness created by her.\nWith so many theories and guesses circulating, she has become a mystery. As for the truth, you could only hope to get an answer from Yelan herself.\nBut unfortunately, this is no easy task either — for it is always she who finds you when she wishes to, not the other way around.",
            "Character Story 1\tPharmacies in Liyue Harbor occasionally receive curious patients.\nOn some days, it might be a Sumeru mercenary, on other days, a Fontaine adventurer, and there might even be some Mondstadt fisher who accidentally fell into water and bumped her head against a rock...\nThese people are of different ages, statuses, and origins, but there is something equally peculiar to them, that is, they all share a slight addiction to pain.\nThey like the stinging sensation when pharmacists apply herbal remedies to their wounds and enjoy the dull pain caused by pressure on their bruises.\nThey even seem to care little if anesthetic is used or not when they are put through painful therapies.\nSurprised by their extraordinary endurance, novice pharmacists are sufficiently distracted, such that they fail to notice that all their patients are actually the same person.\nThey are, all of them, Yelan in disguise. A master in this art, she always manages to avoid attention.\nAs for the wounds on her person, these are the inevitable result of her constant exposure to danger from mission to mission.\nDespite the curious job, Yelan herself is not very curious about the world.\nShe eats, sleeps, and lives just like everyone else, but few things can really pique her interest.\nShe is well-read, but she is no avid reader. She always knows what to say to achieve the best result, yet she takes no pleasure in playing mind games.\nShe travels far and roams the lands, yet the traveling and roaming are bland to her.\nIn Yelan's eyes, these things are not hobbies, but a means to an end.\nShe even prefers to roll the dice to decide how she will pass the time.\nJust as someone who is so used to spicy food might lose the ability to enjoy ordinary dishes, Yelan finds that only spicy cuisine can bring her satisfaction.\n\"Blandness is synonymous with blindness, while thrills afford clarity.\"\nActing upon said philosophy, she chooses an acute style of life, venturing into many places while hiding in the shadows.\nShe dances with danger, secrets, and a strong sense of achievement — these are the vivid proof of her existence.",
            "Character Story 2\tShorn of her masks, Yelan is a special intelligence officer who reports directly to the Tianquan Ningguang.\nThe title itself is not entirely accurate, for it only covers the scope of her work but not her relationship with the Tianquan.\nDeep in her heart, Yelan does not think of herself as anyone's subordinate. The way she sees it, she is not so much working for Ningguang as making good on her end of the deal, or rather... she is honoring a certain pact.\nShe plucks the fruits of intelligence from the tree of danger for Ningguang, and in return, all she asks for is danger itself and the sense of achievement.\nNone know when their collaboration began.\nThe only thing certain is that Yelan has long made her presence felt in lands outside Liyue.\nFrom other nations in Teyvat to even the perilous Abyss...\nEvery secret and perilous demesne shall become a garden where orchids bloom.\nStealthily she roams the night, stars shining upon her in the skies.",
            "Character Story 3\tYelan spends much of her time patrolling and roaming The Chasm, where she often stares into the darkness deep below.\nHer family's history dates far back into an ancient age, and her ancestors once fought in The Chasm against a great cataclysm.\nWanton death was dealt during that battle, and even a yaksha met their end there. Only a few survived the grueling bloodshed.\nOne of her ancestors died, while the other went insane, constituting a huge blow to her family.\nYelan has always wanted to find out what happened back then. Despite her better judgment, she can't help feeling attracted to The Chasm.\nIt almost feels like something that runs in her blood — something inexplicably ominous — has been summoning her to The Chasm.\nPerhaps she will plunge into that darkness one day, and the ill fate that once befell her ancestors shall find her too.\nThe ominous calling that runs in the family shuts down her fear and turns on her craving for danger. This may be the reason for the peculiarities in her character, Yelan presumed.\nShe had never doubted it until she came of age, until the seal on The Chasm was lifted.\nWith the help of her companions, she unveiled the hidden past of her ancestors.\nThat moment marked a new chapter in her life:\nIn the past, she was a wild beast driven by pure instinct. Drawn to danger, she walked into darkness.\nFrom that moment on, she has found the true meaning of her instinct.\nThat which hides inside her, that constant calling, is not only a source of worry but also a light of guidance.\nIt is the blood of heroes which has been howling for 500 years.\nShe has no fear, for the courage within her makes her strong. She craves danger, for the heir of heroes is meant for a great adventure.\nSome day, she will embark on the path her ancestors once took.\nShe is the descendant of heroes, and she shall become the hero for many who will come after her.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe Ministry of Civil Affairs has a Special Attention List.\nThe list isn't long, but everyone on it is truly extraordinary:\nFor instance, the unbound and forthright leader of the armed fleet and the capable outland traveler with a broad range of skills.\nThe list even includes some reclusive adepti in Liyue whose names still bear great weight today...\nThese people could easily bring storms upon Liyue, their intentions notwithstanding.\nAs such, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, ever on guard against risk, still watches them closely.\nOn top of that, there is also a more classified Secret Intelligence List.\nThose on it are the real threats to Liyue.\nSo who are they exactly?\nThe Fatui Harbingers? Figures from the Abyss Order?\nOr perhaps, are even the names of gods listed there?\nOther than the Qixing, Yelan is likely to be the only one who can answer these questions, for she is the very person who compiled the two lists.\nThe results of such work please her greatly, and day after day, she perfects the lists, as crows embellishing their nests with shining trinkets.\nThat said, while both are equally obsessed with collecting, Yelan must sweat and even bleed to secure what she is after, while crows need only flap their wings to achieve their aim.\nFortunately, this does not bother her at all, for she believes that the intelligence is worth whatever cost she is going to pay.\nOne day, the information will come in handy — Liyue will never plunge into disaster without any clue of the danger like it once did 500 years ago.\nShe will see to it that Liyue is not caught unprepared.",
            "Character Story 5\tDon't play dice at Yanshang Teahouse.\nIf you can't help yourself, play with someone you know.\nIf a lady whom you've never seen before invites you to a game, just ignore her.\nHeed this earnest advice from veteran gamblers.\nDo not try your luck with that terrifying woman unless you want to have a gloomy day.\nThe invincible lady of Yanshang Teahouse is none other than Yelan herself, and one of her guises is that of the owner of this teahouse.\nA while ago when she came back from abroad, Liyue had just weathered the Osial crisis, and the Fatui who had occupied Yanshang Teahouse were now largely out of the game.\nYelan seized the opportunity to take it over, turning the teahouse into a secret base.\nOn the one hand, with people from all walks of life to be found here, the teahouse serves as an ideal source of intel. On the other hand, as Yelan has no issue with occasionally giving herself a break, she will pretend to be a regular customer, drinking some tea and playing a few rounds of some game.\nEvery round of finger-guessing is a tiny adventure, and every roll of dice sends sporadic thrills down her spine. Even the smallest challenge is something she can never get enough of.\nAs an intelligence operative, Yelan takes pride in her skills — she is confident that she can read her opponents' eyes and roll the dice such that they fall outside the rules but well within her designs.\nIf there is a draw, that could only mean one thing: Her opponents are cheating too.\nDon't try to reason with her. The very concept of \"reasoning\" is simply foreign to the Yanshang Teahouse, nor does it exist in Yelan's vocabulary.\nBe good and choose between the pain of losing and the disgrace of cheating.\nYou want to have neither, huh? Then why don't you turn the clock back to the very beginning? \nDon't play dice at Yanshang Teahouse!",
            "The Fascinating Bracelet and the Whitesilk Mantle\tThroughout Yelan's intelligence career so far, there has been one memorable operation that fuses both failure and success together.\nOne could say that it was a failure because she lost a family heirloom named the \"Fascinating Bracelet\" during that operation.\nThe inside of the jade bracelet is engraved with a spell passed through her line that turns the heirloom into a simple communication device. However, the spell requires a pair of such vessels to work. Now that only one bracelet is left, it is no more than a mere accessory.\nHowever, the operation also proved a success for Yelan because her enemy did not get the upper hand, either. And this enemy of hers was no ordinary character — it was none other than \"Regrator,\" Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers.\nYelan infiltrated a secret trade route that was run by Regrator behind the scenes, intercepting the goods and picking the most precious one of them as compensation for her bracelet.\nNow, there once existed a strange mystical beast in times of old. A robe made from its fur would be worth a fortune, and due to its rarity, such a robe is exceptionally hard to procure.\nIn fact, the beast is so powerful that although it died centuries ago, its body remains intact today, and its fur still emits a mysterious fragrance.\nRegrator had intended it as an offer to the Tsaritsa, yet Yelan unexpectedly intercepted it.\nNot only that, she also rejected the style that Snezhnayans had chosen for their Tsaritsa — she yanked the fur off, combined it with Liyue's Ramie yarn, and made a rather fashionable sleeved mantle for herself.\nThis series of happenings could be seen as significant or insignificant — depending on one's perspective. Ultimately, it all boils down to three words: gains and losses.\nThe cycle of gaining and losing is a rather accurate summary of Yelan's life.\nNone of that really bothers her though. Instead, she takes immense pleasure from it.",
            "Vision\tYelan wasn't always on her own. Many years ago, she once had a team who watched each others' backs.\nThere were a small group of people who for various reasons chose to tread a path in the dark with her.\nBut back then, Yelan had not yet realized that her clever tricks and ingenious traps, the skills that she took pride in, could not solve everything for her.\nEnemies with a strong sense of self-control would not bite her bait, opponents with cunning and calculating minds would not fall for her schemes, and those with overwhelming power would simply strong-arm their way out of her traps.\nTherefore, Yelan and her team paid the price — one by one, they perished along the way, though they had long foreseen and prepared themselves for such a fate...\nStill, after a mission to investigate the Abyss, Yelan eventually found herself left alone. For the first time in her life, she stopped, for a long, long time.\nThis state of affairs persisted until one day, when Ningguang visited her in her wood hut personally.\n\"You haven't been back to Liyue Harbor for a while. Something must've happened. I can understand if you want to quit.\"\nNingguang stood outside the door, with a serious look on her face but her voice still casual and relaxed.\n\"But it's alright. I work with those I trust, and I trust those I work with. I'm willing to believe that you're here trying to find a way out. All postures, aggressive or defensive, are all means to an end, anyway.\"\nThere was no response, but only a suffocating silence. A long time passed before Ningguang finally heard an answer from behind her:\n\"We both made a mistake: We shouldn't have involved ordinary folk in what we do.\"\n\"Ordinary folk?\"\nEven as Ningguang was formulating thoughts, a flash of blue shot towards her, stopping as it passed her by.\nIn a display of great control from the archer, the arrow quickly shattered into pearls of water and broke into glistening shards of light before touching the ground.\nNingguang turned around and saw Yelan walking up, a bow in hand, blood dripping down from her fingertips.\nOne could only imagine the days and nights of grueling training in archery Yelan had gone through for all her fingers to bleed.\nKnowing Yelan well, Ningguang also understood that she must have been through an uncommonly tough situation. Only that could explain Yelan's uncommon determination to lock herself up for this grueling re-training.\nYelan aimed at the mountain in the distance, a gesture that was also an answer to Ningguang.\nShe released the arrow. Like lightning it shot into the skies, piercing through clouds with might that could shatter the dome of heaven itself. As if responding to the call of an unknown power, waters in the mountains growled and howled, then swirled their way upward in the form of countless arrows.\nWhen they met halfway in the sky, they exploded into a curtain of water, bringing down a squalling shower like those that adorned summer nights.\nAs the sky cleared, there was no rainbow, no butterflies to be seen, only a faint pillar of light that fell into Yelan's palm.\nAccording to Ningguang, the Vision carries a message: \"From today onward, leave all matters to the extraordinary Yelan.\""

            "About Yoimiya: Talking\tI don't worry about \"loose lips sinking ships.\" The emotions contained in the words people say don't lie.

When I first received my Vision, I used it as a flint to light fireworks and boil water, before returning home, chucking it into a storeroom, and forgetting all about it. In the end, it was my father who found it and told me that it was a precious item that I should keep safe. Haha, at least it didn't get taken back by our dear Archon.",
            "Something to Share: Lantern Rite\tDid you know? A lot of the fireworks used during Liyue's Lantern Rite were purchased from our shop. I made them to order before asking Beidou to ship them to Liyue. Exports like these aren't allowed under the Sakoku Decree, but... How can there be festivals without fireworks?",
            "Something to Share: Cycles\t\"When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence.\" Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite.",
            "Something to Share: Spots of Light\tDid you ever try to step on a spot of light before as a child? You know, those patches on the ground created when the sunlight passes through the leaves. I once thought that it would disappear if I stepped on it, but it would always jump onto my foot instead. I tried and tried and tried, but I never succeeded... Quite the sore loser I was, then — sitting on a rock, sighing to myself and thinking, \"Ah, so there are things in this world that can't be stepped on...\"",
            "Interesting Things\tWhile squatting next to some children and watching them catch goldfish during one summer festival, I suddenly had a thought: could I make fireworks that could go off on the surface of the water? Thus, the \"Goldfish Fireworks\" were born! They can swim here and there, emit multi-colored lights, and they can even spit bubbles! I never thought that it would actually work, but I guess wonders never cease.",
            "About Beidou\tBeidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.",
            "About the Raiden Shogun\tFireworks are probably the furthest thing from the \"eternity\" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has \"eternity\" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka: Seriousness\tWe cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word \"ladylike\" was practically made just for her.",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka: Baths\tWe once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths.",
            "About Thoma\tHe's quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says. Sometimes, it might seem like there's no connection, but as he goes on, everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose. It's... quite different from how I do things. I ask him for help whenever I encounter a matter I can't settle.",
            "About Yae Miko\tAyaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, \"isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?\" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?",
            "About Arataki Itto: Duels\tOh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?",
            "About Arataki Itto: Arataki's Gang\tArataki's gang? Huh!? So he isn't just someone with too much free time on his hands?",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tPeople with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery. They talk of flowers and birds, wind and moon, but never about the reality that confronts them. He's got quite the tale to tell, I'm sure.",
            "About Kujou Sara\tDue to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture. Kujou Sara's probably the most reasonable of the bunch. At least she'll hear me out before passing any judgment. If I'm in the right, she'll acknowledge my perspective, and if I'm wrong... Hehe, then I'll get Thoma to come and help me apologize to her!",
            "About Sayu\tLet me know if you see her, alright? I'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. She always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!",
            "About Klee\tWait, you said there was a kid in Mondstadt who was good at making bombs?... Now, they aren't much different from fireworks. In other words, she might be a genius... Ohh, I'd love to meet her. *sigh* But isn't it dangerous to let children play with explosives? Don't the people of Mondstadt worry about that?",
            "About Kirara\tThe courier from Komaniya Express? She's super reliable and really quick on her feet! Ingredients used in coloring the fireworks always run out quickly, but she always delivers a new batch right when I need them! I gave her a firework once as a thank-you gift, but she was too scared to light it, saying that she got spooked once by the sound of fireworks. Hehe, so I told her to find a nice viewing spot far away and set it off for her.",
            "More About Yoimiya: I\tYou wanna hear a story? Alright, alright. Sit here, and I shall tell you the story I'm most proud of — the story of the Naganohara family! You'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?",
            "More About Yoimiya: II\tOur family has a long tradition in which we will give every client who orders customized fireworks a note. Its contents can only be understood by our family, and it records the specific formula of the fireworks that were ordered. Whether ten years or a hundred years pass, our family can make exactly the same fireworks as they did in the past so long as the client brings us that note.",
            "More About Yoimiya: III\tThe loveliest fireworks go along with the most wondrous moments. Tiny little emotions that can easily slip away are captured within these fireworks and passed down in a different form. The notes we give our clients are like a key that awaits those who wish to open a gate to commemorate the past. We at Naganohara are the keepers of that gate.",
            "More About Yoimiya: IV\tEvery moment of the summer festival is a moving tale. Those who meet under the light of fireworks grow up, mature, and grow old. When they set off the same fireworks as they did in the beginning, the skies reflect that same image from years ago... Fireworks are not eternal, but I believe that the wonderful emotions behind them should walk alongside Inazuma into eternity.",
            "More About Yoimiya: V\tI shan't tell the final tale, I think. Instead, let's watch the fireworks together in silence. You can record the beautiful scenery and all the things you wanna say down. Not that this is the end, of course. On the contrary, I believe that our story is only just beginning.",
            "Yoimiya's Hobbies: Playing\tFireworks! Wait, that doesn't count? Well then, let me think. Um... This one's a toughie.

            "Least Favorite Food\tUgh... Milk never fails to start some real fireworks in my stomach — crackle, kaboom! Y'know what I mean? But I can handle dishes and snacks made with milk for some reason, hmm. Maybe the little Seelie in my stomach is just pickier than most.",

            "Character Details\tYoimiya's name is renowned throughout Hanamizaka.\nShe is the most skilled pyrotechnician in Inazuma and is known as the \"Queen of the Summer Festival.\"\nYoimiya, who has inherited the mantle of \"Naganohara,\" is able to give people an unparalleled experience with her ever-changing and spectacular fireworks.\nIn addition to being a craftsperson, she is also the \"heroic sister\" in the eyes of many children. No matter how big the problem is, Yoimiya always has a solution to save the day.\nBe it the illusions of fear or the shadows of cold reality, they will all dissipate under the starlight magic of Yoimiya's fireworks.\nThe children are not the only ones she helps — as long as one is willing to talk to her about their troubles, she will lend a helping hand, and try her best to help them through the crisis.\nSplendid fireworks, warm starlight and passionate lights all join in a swirling dance in Yoimiya's hands. Her bright smile is always able to inspire fellow travelers and light up the way for them.",
            "Character Story 1\tTo Inazumans, fireworks symbolize summer.\nThe various festivals that take place at fixed times feature a rotation of various events, with fireworks being the sole constant.\nOver a century ago, the Yashiro Commission once organized a dazzling fireworks display with \"commemoration\" as the theme.\nThe fireworks then were made by the greatest pyrotechnicians in the land, and this was the origin of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.\nIn latter days, fireworks would become more common, and the Naganohara Fireworks Show would slowly become an event in which all people would participate.\nDuring the Fireworks Show, everyone can light their favorite fireworks, and the owner of the Naganohara Fireworks store will pick an appropriate time to set up a most lavish performance.\nThe year Yoimiya took over, her first fiesta was already jaw-droppingly good.\nOn the night before that Fireworks Show, Kamisato Ayaka enjoined Yoimiya thusly: \"Her Excellency will be watching this fireworks display personally. As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem — the Electro Mitsudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would.\"\n\"Haha, just wait for it!\" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.\nBefore the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.\nYet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.\nIt was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an \"angling\" trick added to it.\nIf viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.\nOf course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.\nWith Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, \"Queen of the Summer Festival,\" coined.",
            "Character Story 2\tNaganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always in full swing. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.\nHowever, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.\nIf chatting with the guest is her way of \"understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted,\" then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...\nYoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.\nShe doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.\nHer neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.\nWhat she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.\nAfter taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.\nYoimiya puts it this way: \"I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!\"",
            "Character Story 3\tCraftsmen seeking perfection are often rigorous and self-disciplined, but Yoimiya is an exception, acting freely and taking unscheduled breaks.\nSometimes, she even has to work late into the night when she misses her daytime work due to chatting for too long. But when the sun begins to rise, she will climb up to the heights to see the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment at having finished her work in her heart. Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...\nHer neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.\nFortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.\nAt some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.\nPerhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.\nLiving as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.\nOf course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations. Mistakes shall not be made during these all-important performances — her \"official business.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tApart from selling fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells various intricate knickknacks. This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.\nAll manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.\nFrom the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.\nThey are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared his nemesis.\nYoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys. With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.\nMany people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, \"Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all,\" she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too — everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all.",
            "Character Story 5\t\"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.\"\nThis nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.\nAs such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.\nYoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the \"rainbows\" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them \"sufficiently shiny,\" whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.\nIndeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.\nBut it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that \"rainbows\" could indeed be exchanged for \"fireworks.\"\nThough some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.\n\"The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures.\"\nThe legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...\nPerhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.\nThe children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.\nYoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.",
            "Yoimiya's Candy Box: \"Sweet Pearl\"\tEvery festival, Yoimiya not only tries snacks from every store, but she also collects all sorts of candies, wrapping them up with care before storing them away inside a small candy box.\nYoimiya's candy box is a small crimson ball that has been decorated with delicate lanyards and ornate accessories, much like the hair accessories she often wears.\nEach time she encounters a joyous event, she will take one candy out of the box and eat it. If her friends or the children are around, she will share the sweets with them.\nYoimiya's neighbors often mistake her hair ornaments for the candy box, hence its erroneous nickname \"Sweet Pearl.\"\nThe speed at which the box lightens is taken as an important measure of happiness.\nThe quicker it empties, the more pleased Yoimiya is.\nSometimes, when things get busy, she sometimes absently uses the candy box as a hair accessory, realizing her mistake only after the day is done.\nStill, even this error would inspire Yoimiya. From then on, she would wear them interchangeably.\n\"Take a guess: does my hair ornament have candy in it today? Free pick of the sweets to anyone who gets it right!\"",
            "Vision\tYoimiya is always up for a chat. It is only when the fireworks are ascending into the skies that she quiets down and just watches the lovely scenery.\nPeople often say that fireworks come and go in a fleeting heartbeat, but if they are memorable enough, they will remain in bloom forever in people's hearts.\nThose who accompanied you and the loveliness of the moment itself, will burrow deep into your mind as a beautiful memory.\nAnd as you look upon the same fireworks, many years later, that same memory and the feelings that came with it will surely rise again to the forefront of your heart.\nIs this not also \"Eternity\"?\nThe special firework formula slips that belong solely to the Naganohara family exist for precisely this purpose.\nBy incorporating goodwill and wishes into the gorgeous fireworks, ephemeral things are etched into eternity. This is the meaning of Yoimiya's line of work.\nOn one summer night following her taking over Naganohara Fireworks, Yoimiya could not sleep, and thus she continued in her research till daylight came.\nSuddenly, she heard a tinkling sound, and a burning-red object fell into an unused launching tube.\nAt first, Yoimiya used her Vision as a sort of lighter. Fortunately, her father discovered it and explained a Vision's significance to her.\nSo, this tiny gem could grant a person astonishing and mysterious powers. And yet what else could it do other than protect the children or chase some mischievous monsters away?\n\"Even if it could have other uses,\" Yoimiya thought, \"it may not ever need to do these things in my hands. I'm just someone who pursues happiness, a fireworks-maker who enjoys living life.\"\nTime has flown since then, and Yoimiya has grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of \"fire,\" with her skill at making fireworks having likewise increased.\nSometimes, she stops to ask herself this: \"How did someone as ordinary as me receive the acknowledgment of the gods? Do the gods... enjoy fireworks, by any chance?\""

            "Good Morning\tGood morning! The dew at dawn is perfect for brewing tea, so I made some for you. Drink up, and then we'll head off!",
            "Good Afternoon\tI'd like to indulge in a nap after lunch. Oh? ...You're not tired?",
            "Good Evening\tLet's go listen to tonight's storytelling performance together. Liu Su's rendition of \"Ring of Raining Blades\" is most sublime!",
            "Good Night\tThere's a chill in the air tonight, so you mustn't stay out late. Good night!",
            "About Yun Jin: Schooling\tMy schooling started very early. In fact, my earliest memories are of my father teaching me to read. Despite my best efforts, my ability is not half of his. Enough to write operas, but compared to his level of erudition, I still have much to strive for.",
            "About Yun Jin: Opera Training\tIn her youth, my mother was a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, and I learned all the operas I know from her. But, you could never imagine how strict she was with me as a teacher. Thinking back on it now, I... *sigh* No, no, no, I'd rather not think about it at all.",
            "About Us: Opera Troupe\tWe have some grand performances coming up soon, and it just so happens that we have an opening for someone to play the part of a skilled swordfighter. I think you'd be a perfect match for the part. How about it? Would you like to join our troupe? We can even enjoy some tea together in between acts.",
            "About Us: Rock 'n' Roll\tHuh? You like rock 'n' roll? Oh, that's great! I'll be sure to bring you along the next time I go out to see a show. And when I get back, I can just tell the senior troupe members that I went out to visit you... Hehe, that way, they won't have any reason to get on my case about going out.",
            "About the Vision\tHmm? My Vision? Hehe, I suppose the Lord of Geo must be a fan of the opera. Perhaps the old man was so delighted with my performance that he decided to grant me a Vision.",
            "Something to Share: Drinks\tOne of my absolute favorite pastimes is trying out all kinds of new beverages. I've already tried all the sophisticated-sounding drinks that previous generations came up with — you know, like Pine Nectar Tea and Snow Blossom Tea. I'm beginning to worry that I'll run out of new drinks to try soon. You don't happen to have any recommendations, do you?",
            "Something to Share: Dreams\tSometimes, I just feel like casting off my opera costume and going traveling overseas. You know, to explore the outside world. For now, I'll need to keep working hard at what I'm doing, so someday that dream can come true.",
            "Interesting Things\tThe chirping of the songbirds at daybreak always puts me in the best of moods.",
            "About Xinyan\tThe elders of the troupe are always harping on about rock 'n' roll being a bad influence. Needless to say, they never approve of me going to see Xinyan's shows. \"It's for your own good,\" they say. Hmph, all it's really about is their inability to accept anything new. Whatever, those old fogies can't tell me what to do. I'm going to keep rocking out at Xinyan's gigs, every week, and that's that.",
            "About Hu Tao\tAh yes, Hu Tao. Very expressive face, and she has a sharp mind too — you can be discussing the most mundane thing in the world, and she'll always bring out a string of witty remarks. I admire her a lot. There's never a dull moment when you have friends like her around.",
            "About Zhongli\tThe customs of the opera are very particular, and are passed down from generation to generation. Sometimes I find that I only know the hows but not the whys behind what we do. But when speaking with Zhongli, it is abundantly evident that he knows the origins behind almost everything. Who wouldn't be delighted to have such a connoisseur in their audience?",

            "About Xingqiu\tOh, so you are also acquainted with Xingqiu? Haha, he is quite the clever one, and with a sharp wit as well. The moment you let your guard down, you're at risk of becoming the butt of one of his practical jokes... Don't say I didn't warn you.",
            "About Shenhe\tI have long since known \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation\" inside out, back to front, but it was only very recently that I learned that the \"divine damsel\" in question is actually a real person. Life is full of strange twists sometimes! My only hope is that she can find true friendship and never be lonely again.",
            "About Keqing\tI have yet to see the Yuheng ever attend an opera performance. Now that I think about it, whenever I happen to see her out on the street, she always seems to be in a great hurry.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tKaedehara Kazuha is among the many outlanders who enjoy Liyue opera. Whether it's an orchestral section or a percussive piece, he always sits there and listens quietly. Talk about great manners!",
            "More About Yun Jin: I\tMany of the operas we've been performing recently are new ones that I wrote after assuming the directorship of the troupe. I suppose the fact that I can both write and sing my own material has contributed to my rising popularity in Liyue Harbor.",
            "More About Yun Jin: II\tPer the tradition, actors must wrap their hair, put on full-face makeup and an elaborate costume, and make all sorts of other preparations before they take the stage. There's no doubt that an opera star in full attire looks spectacular, but achieving this look is frightfully exhausting. So I perform without hair and makeup whenever I have the option — and if I must perform in full dress, I try to select a costume that isn't too heavy. Fortunately, the good folks at Heyu Tea House are quite lenient with us. Otherwise, we'd be working ourselves to early graves.",
            "More About Yun Jin: III\tAt the start of my opera career, I have to say I did let the standing ovations from our audiences go to my head a little. It wasn't long before I developed a captious attitude... If I didn't like the script, or if the stage was too small, or if I thought there weren't enough people in the audience, I would refuse to perform. Looking back now, it was all terribly arrogant of me... my goodness. I shall never let myself become so vain again.",
            "More About Yun Jin: IV\tNow that I think about it, the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has been under my leadership for quite some time now. Before taking it over, I only knew two things: how to write opera and how to perform it on stage. I never gave any thought to how to run a troupe. Becoming the troupe's director gave me a crash course in this unfamiliar area and I've experienced all the highs and lows of working with people along the way... Only now do I understand that life mirrors opera, just as opera reflects life.",
            "More About Yun Jin: V\tWell you know, many of Liyue's legends are centered around stories of gods and the adepti, so most operas focus on the supernatural, too. A prime example would be \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation,\" which we have been performing recently. Long-time opera fans adore this sort of material, but in this age of humanity, I would rather like to tell stories about ordinary people. Yes, how grand it would be to sing about the hopes and dreams of ordinary people for all to hear. I've never shared these thoughts with anyone before... Thank you for listening so patiently. I'm fortunate to have a close friend like you.",
            "Yun Jin's Hobbies\tMy hobbies? Well, opera, of course! It's what I truly love and it's what I will be pursuing for the rest of my life.",
            "Yun Jin's Troubles\t*sigh* Well, as you can probably imagine, I always have to be mindful of what I eat and make sure I stay in shape. It's a shame, because the temptation to indulge in all the tasty delicacies the city has to offer is just as strong to me as to anyone else...",
            "Favorite Food\tTianshu Meat, Black-Back Perch Stew, Cured Pork Dry Hotpot... Oh, I just want them all! Unfortunately, I basically never get to eat such things, but... um, if you don't mind me asking... Can you cook any of those dishes?",
            "Least Favorite Food\tEvery day's the same... Stir-Fried Shrimp, day in and day out. No matter how they prepare it, it always tastes the same. Ugh, ghastly! I really can't stand it anymore...",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tMmm! There's no better feeling than indulging in your favorite food... It's a shame that I can only afford to have a little bite.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tOh, what a magnificent feast! Wait a second, I'll grab us some drinks to accompany the meal.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tI'm sorry... This meal isn't really agreeing with me.",
            "Birthday\tOh, so today's your birthday? Well, I wouldn't know how to throw you a feast if I tried... so how about I sing you a song? For you alone, an audience of one. So... what song would you like to hear me sing? The choice is yours.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tAs the saying goes: \"Achievement in a field is the result of how hard you are willing to work at it, not how much you enjoy it.\"",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tIt looks like all my rigorous training is finally paying off.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tI began my training in the art of the spear hoping to enhance my performance in stage combat. I stuck with it hoping to master the techniques of self-defense. Today, it looks like I have finally achieved both of these goals.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tThe art of the spear is a vast and profound discipline... There is an almost infinite number of things one can learn. I am glad to have had you by my side during my training. Haha, I believe I've grasped the basics now. I daresay you'd better be careful when we're sparring together in the future.",

            "Character Details\tHeyu Tea House has been a popular leisure spot for the people of Liyue.\nIts business thrives on two things, one of them being its boss Fan Er'ye's business acumen in inviting a top-notch Tea Master who tells the best stories of all.\nBesides that, there is also the performance of the acclaimed troupe, Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Its director and soul — a famed opera singer named Yun Jin — takes the stage at the tea house from time to time.\nWhile one can always get delicious delicacies or good storytelling as long as one knows where to look, Yun Jin's performance does not just await one there.\nAs a result, you can always find fans of Yun Jin trying their luck at Heyu Tea House. While waiting for Yun Jin's performance, they discuss her past performances and how they feel about them.\nAs such, more people frequent the tea house, with nine out of ten of them being Yun Jin's fans.\nFan Er'ye couldn't be more satisfied with this state of affairs.",
            "Character Story 1\tLiyue Opera is one of the traditional arts of Liyue that has been passed down for generations.\nLiyue Opera enjoys a long history, and it has gone through quite some changes from what it was originally created to be.\nThe good thing is, the Liyue Opera we see now retains the sophisticated-sounding vocals and richly varied melodies of old.\nLiyue Opera performers usually perform in troupes, and the most acclaimed one of them is the Yun-Han Opera Troupe.\nFor generations, the troupe has been run by the historic house of Yun, and its current director is a prominent figure in Liyue Harbor — the opera singer Yun Jin.\nYun Jin made her name at a young age when she stunned her audience with a sweet voice and lively costumes in her debut performance.\nThe more she performs, the better-honed her animated and dynamic style becomes.\nWhether it's a delicate and dignified young lady or a mighty and honorable heroine, she can play any role.\nWhat's even rarer is that this young actress is also a playwright. Other than \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation,\" the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has performed many other new plays in recent years, all of which were written by Yun Jin.\nWith her superb skill, it is no wonder why long-time opera fans often visit Heyu Tea House to ask about Yun Jin's performance schedule when their starving ears demand good opera singing.",
            "Character Story 2\tYun Jin was born in a family of Liyue Opera performers.\nHer father is a playwright, and her mother used to be a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, taking up the mantle from Yun Jin's grandfather.\nIn such an environment, Yun Jin was exposed to Liyue Opera at a very early age, often amusing herself by echoing her mother's singing.\nA childhood hobby, as many would tend to believe, seems unlikely to be developed into a lifelong career, yet Yun Jin proved to be an exception.\nShe was serious about it and insisted on learning the art.\nHer parents were delighted to see their daughter's determination and imparted everything they knew about the Liyue Opera to her. As such, Yun Jin started learning the opera early.\nHowever, Liyue Opera is a complex art that takes years of perfection to master.\nSo even for a child as gifted as Yun Jin, what awaited her was sweat and tears. While ordinary children might shy away from the pain of hamstring stretches and the tedium of memorizing lyrics, little Yun Jin hung tough and became quite accomplished.\nBy the time she finished all the subjects in Liyue Opera, veterans of Yun-Han Opera Troupe who watched her grow up couldn't help but exclaim,\n\"Yet another rising opera star is about to shine upon Liyue Harbor!\"",
            "Character Story 3\tMany veterans of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe first joined the troupe when Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge.\nThey have remained committed since Yun Jin took the troupe over.\nTheir love for the art of Liyue Opera is so deep — perhaps even to an excessive degree — that they frown upon any other forms of music performance, including rock 'n' roll.\nYun Jin, however, thinks otherwise. She finds that rock 'n' roll vibrates with vigor and even became friends with the rock 'n' roll musician Xinyan.\nElders of the troupe are glad to follow Yun Jin's lead during rehearsals, but when it comes to daily life, they treat her like their little granddaughter.\n\"Sweetie, listen to us. No spicy food, it hurts your voice. Meat is fine, but refrain from eating too much, or you will put on weight.\"\n\"If you really can't help yourself, have more shrimp. Stay away from the... roll 'n' roll thing. All they know is yelling.\"\nThese caring elders will nag Yun Jin about attending rock 'n' roll performance for hours on end.\nFaced with the impossible mission of persuading stubborn granddads and grannies, Yun Jin has to be creative.\nWhile it's not an option to go to Xinyan's performance, it's perfectly acceptable to visit Fan Er'ye's adopted daughter Xingyan and discuss Liyue Opera with her.\nThe elders are not fond of the rock star Xinyan, but they have taken a shine to Xingyan the adopted daughter of Fan Er'ye.\n\"I've heard that Xingyan can cook and do embroidery. She must be a polite and accomplished young lady. Yun Jin may be able to pick up a thing or two from hanging out with her. How capital!\"\nYun Jin has long got Fan Er'ye to agree on the details concerning the made-up Xingyan, so don't worry. No one's gonna call her out on this!",
            "Character Story 4\tYun Jin goes by many names. To some, she is Director Yun, and to others, Sir Yun.\nThey call her Director Yun for her leadership of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Though there are managers to help with everyday work, Yun Jin is the one who makes the big decisions. She thus earned the name of Director Yun from people in business circles.\nAs for Sir Yun, that is another story.\nWhen Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, long-time fans respectfully addressed him as Sir Yun. After Yun Jin took charge later, these fans frequented her performances as well.\nThere was once after a show when an impressed fan half-joked with others, \"the Sir Yun we have now sings rather well too.\"\nA voice from the crowd immediately countered by saying: \"How can you address a young girl as Sir?\"\nUpon hearing this, Yun Jin curved her lips.\n\"Those who were born early, learn early. They are naturally better-informed than others. It's every bit right for them to be referred to as Sirs.\"\n\"But one doesn't have to be old to be knowledgeable. Besides, why can't a girl be knowledgeable?\"\n\"You are quick in mind and speech, and are thus qualified to be called Sir. I have answered your eminent question — that also makes me a Sir.\"\nHer remarks impressed the fans present, who shared this story to many. In the end, everyone followed the trend and started to call her Sir Yun whether they had or had not met her in person.",
            "Character Story 5\tMany traditional Liyue Operas revolve around the theme of the adepti and Rex Lapis himself.\nA prime example would be \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation.\" People are full of wonderful fantasies about the adepti and would like to see the representation of their joy and anger on stage. Thus, stories portraying them make up the majority of the repertoire of Liyue Opera.\nWhen Yun Jin was young, she would find these stories engaging, but having exhausted every adeptal legend in her performing career, her take on theming gradually changed.\nWhy not experiment with other themes? For instance... stories of our own, perhaps?\nStories that tell of our earthly joys and sorrows, songs that sing of the hatreds and passions of humanity.\nMaybe these stories of mere mortals may not make it as classics of Liyue Opera, but there will always be some people who remember them.\nIn love our thoughts linger, in rage our hearts burn, and in obsession, our minds go astray. These emotions, good or bad, lift the veil that covers our feelings and souls.\nYun Jin is no adeptus. She can never put herself in the shoes of the adepti, yet she is endowed with the most accurate and sensitive grasp of human emotions.\n\"So, let me sing of human stories. May my brush be the brush of all hearts and my voice the voice of all souls.\"\nThis is the unspoken wish that Yun Jin has so far only kept to herself.",
            "Longevity Lock\tHer ancestors used to work as weaponsmiths instead of opera performers.\nLater, someone in the family who was tired of weapon forging grew an interest in the performing arts. By the time it came to Yun Jin's generation, few of the Yuns still practiced the art of forging.\nMany forged things have been passed down, though. The lock-shaped copper pendant that Yun Jin carries with her is one such item.\nIn her childhood, she often practiced dancing for a whole day under the scorching heat of the sun. Sometimes, she would even faint from the exhaustion.\nHer parents' hearts ached for her, but they knew well that she had to go through such things to lay a solid foundation.\nSo instead of stopping her, they gave Yun Jin the lock in the hopes that it would keep fortune and health within her.\nSince then, the lock has never left Yun Jin's side. Before every performance, it is a routine for Yun Jin to reminisce about those days of bittersweet training by cleaning the lock with great care.\nIt feels as if she was caressing the devoted heart of the little Yun Jin who was learning the opera.",
            "Vision\tShortly after Yun Jin's debut, Yun Jin quickly got the hang of stage performance through dozens of shows and her great intelligence.\nAt the time, her appearance meant a whole night of applause for a performance. However, the more she played, the more she felt at a loss — these were not the operas she wanted to perform.\nIn every opera, the pitch and tempo would invariably go either up or down to indicate drama or doldrum.\nAs time passed by, the visage of the various characters seemed to blend and blur.\nThe music would come on, followed by a neat dance, and then her sweet voice. The girl in \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation\" seemed no different from the fisherman's daughter in \"String of Pearls.\"\nWhile the audience did not object, Yun Jin was not satisfied. \"Is skillful singing and dancing all it takes to tell a moving tale?\"\nWhat broke her bottleneck was an opera named \"Snow Treading.\"\nIt was a monodrama about a strenuous walk in the snow. It happened to be a snowy day when Yun Jin first performed the opera.\nHaving gone astray in the snow, the character felt lost and lamented her helplessness. Somehow, the snow in the story seemed to fall into reality. Yun Jin, who had also found herself adrift, felt as if she had become her character.\nThat was what she had been looking for, the feeling of leaving herself behind and walking in the shoes of the many characters she played.\nTo breathe, to live, and to smile just like them.\nThat was the opera she had wanted to sing, the story she had wanted to tell — one about true emotions, a world built on tens of thousands of individuals who live lives of their own.\nYun Jin could no longer recall how she returned backstage after the epiphany. All she knew was that when she finally had time to take off her costume, she found a Vision in her sleeve."

            "Hello\tA new contract? Okay. I'm still on leave, but I can accompany you for a while. What name should I use on the contract? I have a great many names, though when on leave I tend to go by Zhongli. And you, Traveler? What name will you be signing on this contract?",
            "Chat: Journeys\tEvery journey has its final day. Don't rush.",
            "Chat: Tours\tWhere do you want to go next? If you'd like to see Liyue's tourist spots, I have a few references.",
            "Chat: Liyue\tBoats are made for transferring commodities back and forth, and those that come across Liyue tend to stay a while, so it is where many things come to settle.",
            "Chat: Reminiscing\tOsmanthus wine tastes the same as I remember... But where are those who share the memory?",
            "After the Rain\tVioletgrass is a plant that enjoys a moist environment and is best picked after it rains. If you should choose to pick any, be sure to store them appropriately.",
            "When It Snows\tWe should look for a place to take shelter. I'll be fine, but we don't want you catching a cold.",
            "When the Wind Is Blowing\tThis weather is no good for being on vacation. We should go and take in an opera.",
            "Good Morning\tI hope today too shall be prosperous.",
            "Good Afternoon\tWant a quick meal to pick us back up? I know a good place in Chihu Rock.",
            "Good Evening\tBy this time of night, we will have already missed Ms. Yun's play, but Liyue is full of interesting places to explore, even at night.",
            "Good Night\tThe market is closed and the port has settled. Go get some rest.",
            "About Zhongli\tNothing can be accomplished without rules or standards. No matter if it is mortals or adepti, everyone has their place. This rule is what keeps Liyue in peace.",
            "About Us: Gold\tGold is Liyue's treasure. It is the blood that runs through her heart. As for whether your own heart shines like gold — we will have to wait and see.",
            "About Us: Contracts\tYou and I have a contract, so feel free to discuss anything at all within the scope of said contract.",
            "About Us: Fairness\tWe can discuss matters that fall outside of our contract, too. After all, I have been on this land for a time, and have come to know a thing or two. Of course, I do hope you can do some things for me as well. That would only be fair.",
            "About Us: Confusion\tContracts cannot be used to define friendship, nor measure sentiment. So just what can we use to measure the weight of our emotions? Do you know the answer, friend?",
            "About the Vision\tVisions... are also a type of contract. You should know that all power comes at a price. For every bit of power you gain, so too do you gain more responsibility.",
            "Something to Share\tTrade relies on both contracts and fairness. There is one thing you must never forget when making and abiding by a contract: if fairness is lost, then the contract shall become proof of one's deception.",
            "Interesting Things\tIf you're heading to Jueyun Karst, please bring me back a bunch of Qingxin. Just one bunch is enough. Travel expenses...? Ah, I almost forgot. During the effective period of our contract, travel expenses are to be paid for by yourself. Sorry to bother you.",
            "About Xiao\tYou speak of the young adeptus of Guili Plains... *sigh* Still fulfilling his duty to this very day. Please, give this Remedium Tertiorum to him on my behalf. Oh, yes... be sure not to let Paimon eat them. Nothing of this world can withstand the power of this medicine.",
            "About Venti\t*sniff* Tsk... It reeks of wine. That bard has just been through here, hasn't he? That drunkard is a disgrace to the arts. Oh... Has he tricked you into getting drunk? You're slurring a little. Wait a moment, I'll brew a pot of sobering tea. It'll be ready in only six hours, so just wait a moment.",
            "About Ningguang\tDespite the multitude of affairs that she deals with in a day, Ningguang always continues to press on. A rare gem indeed. I'm reminded of the time that she used to walk barefoot from Yaoguang Shoal to the south wharf, trying to sell her wares as she went. Time is cruel to humans.",
            "About Hu Tao\tThe current overseer of the funeral parlor? Ahem. I cannot deal with that child.",
            "About Tartaglia: Composed\tThat rascal from Snezhnaya has yet to depart from Liyue? Heh, no matter. Just let me know if he gives you any trouble. I shall deal with the matter swiftly.",
            "About Tartaglia: Drinks\tIt's said that Childe and his reputation have yet again stirred up waves among the inner ranks of the Fatui. Knowing his type, he will be sure to swiftly depose anyone who dares to challenge his actions. Hmm... Come to think of it, there will be a lot of interesting news to be heard the next time we gather for drinks. Care to join me when the time comes, Traveler?",
            "About Ganyu\tLiyue's prosperity has not merely been built on Rex Lapis' oracles or wisdom. It is also thanks to the countless servants of the Geo Archon who have honored their end of the contract. Of them, Ganyu is the one who has served for the longest time. If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval.",
            "About Keqing\tShe is the most impious of the Qixing — but I actually find the conviction of such people quite endearing. The only reason I was able to consider taking a step back from such overarching management of Liyue was because there are people like her. People who speak up when they believe themselves to be right, and then go and do something decisive about it.",
            "About Yanfei\tDespite never having signed a contract with me, she upholds order within many strata of Liyue society in her own way, dispelling misconceptions and correcting biases... Should her father one day return from his travels, I imagine that he would be even more delighted than I.",
            "About Baal\tTime tempers all volition. Yet she would give up everyone for her beliefs. Perhaps it is for this very reason that she has come to where she stands today... Should the chance come by me, I too would like to learn of the Eternity for which she so earnestly endeavors.",
            "About Buer\tAs well as ruling over all of Sumeru, the God of Wisdom, Buer, has a duty to guard Irminsul. Only one who possesses great wisdom could hope to shoulder these responsibilities. All life in Teyvat owes her gratitude for saving Irminsul.",
            "About Furina\tShe made a contract with her own self to save the nation, strictly adhered to it for over five centuries without once wavering, and even fooled the Heavenly Principles in the end... I have great respect for approaches to justice that place exacting demands not only on others, but also on the self. Though her divinity has vanished and the throne of the Archon is no more, Furina will go down in Fontaine's history as a God of Justice worthy of recognition.",
            "About Xianyun\tI hear many merchants of Liyue tell tales of a Ms. Xianyun. By most accounts, she appears proud and taciturn upon first glance, yet in conversation, people find her to be forthright and fair-minded, and they are pleased to make her acquaintance. I am glad to hear this. But... I have also heard a great many accounts lauding her readiness to part with large sums of Mora...",
            "More About Zhongli: I\tWhy is it that once you finally get a break, rather than taking a rest, you instead come to me? Is it that you want to hear one of my stories?",
            "More About Zhongli: II\tHave you heard of the origin of the Blackcliff Forge? In the past, they would mine the ore veins of Mt. Tianheng, and then replace the cavities with factory equipment. Tunnels run in all directions throughout the mountain — some even run to the ruins deep within the earth. I doubt there is a person today who could map out all the tunnels.",
            "More About Zhongli: III\tHave you heard of the origins of the Lantern Rite? In a war, long ago, the people of Liyue would release lanterns to remind their soldiers of the way home, and to never lose sight of themselves. Though in this day and age, I doubt there are any that remember.",
            "More About Zhongli: IV\tThe God of Contracts. Have you heard of him? He has an impressive memory. He remembers the name of every person he comes across, and the date that every ship built in Liyue sets sail. After all, only in being able to do so can he memorize all of the contracts he holds. With that said, not every memory is a happy one...",
            "More About Zhongli: V\tFor those that live too long, the friends of days gone by and scenes from their adventures live on in their memories. As such, I have no regrets in meeting you, friend. Should the day ever come that we are not together, you will continue to shine like gold in my memories.",
            "Zhongli's Hobbies\tI enjoy partaking in walks through the city — when time permits. I find it very calming. Yes... Just when did this feeling begin...?",
            "Zhongli's Troubles\tTo get people to abide by a contract and act in accordance with the guidelines set out within is simply to ask them to respect the concept of fairness. It is not a large request. How are there those who still do not understand such simplicity?",
            "Favorite Food\tThere was once a drink I used to enjoy with friends — long ago... Is it because the climate has changed? A shame I will never be able to relish in its smooth flavor again.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI don't like seafood. Just seeing it reminds me of that... slimy texture, and that scent that just won't wash off. As for why I hate it... *sigh* It's a long story, so let's just say my memory is a little too good.",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tThe finest ingredients cooked with true expertise. This is no small feat.",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tThe art of gastronomy is a fascinating one. That it appeals to you comes as no surprise.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tSince you seem to have some time on your hands, why don't we find a quiet place and I'll share one of my stories with you.",
            "Birthday\tHappy birthday. This is a dried Glaze Lily that came into bloom on the day of your birth. Long ago, the people of Liyue would say that this flower blooms bearing the weight of the beautiful memories and prayers of the land. I believe this to have applied on the day you were born as well.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tIt seems my strength is returning. Not a lot, but enough.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tMy power is growing, and so with it grows the burden on my body... I'm okay. My structure is not the same as that of normal people. Please, do not worry yourself.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tI see. Using a Vision harnesses elements. As far as the common folk are concerned, this is no small feat. So... back then... they were aware of this as they stood beside me...",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tAfter letting go of my Gnosis, I never expected to see a day like this again. Thank you, friend. Ah, yes, I have a new contract here. Care to take a look at it together?",

            "Character Details\tIn Liyue's traditional customs, \"receiving adepti\" and \"sending adepti off\" are equally important.\nThe Hus of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, who have been in this business for 77 generations, are the masters of handling funerals. However, Hu Tao, the current owner of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, primarily focuses on the art of sending mortals on their way.\nFor the various ceremonies for sending adepti off, Hu Tao usually employs the help of a friend in more or less the same business. That person's name is Zhongli. The adepti have been with Liyue for millennia, but only a handful have ascended in the past three thousand years, which means that everything regarding the traditions now only exists in texts. This is not something one would likely witness twice in their entire lifetime.\nNot even the most particular and learned of researchers or scholars could find one fault in Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's ceremonies for sending adepti off.\nEverything must be perfect, from the costumes, the time, the place, the items, the weather, the scheduled length, the size of the permitted audience, to the stature, profession, and age of said audience. Nothing can be overlooked.\nWhen folk describe Zhongli as \"living history,\" the latter usually only smiles and sighs.\n\"I... just have a good memory.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tIn Liyue, if a person pays great attention to details, and has insuperable criteria by which they judge certain matters, then they are called \"particular.\"\nIn truth, everyone is \"particular\" about something. Some people hate spicy food, others don't eat fish, and some want their tofu served sweet...\nBut as for Zhongli, he is particular about everything.\nHe attends operas performed by only the most celebrated stars, takes only the most luxuriant thrushes out for walks, and he goes into the kitchen personally to instruct the cooks as to the ratio of shrimp and fish required to make the most authentic Fullmoon Egg.\nZhongli has expertise in all manner of things, from fashion to daily essentials, to fine wines and delicacies, to teas and spices, and to flora and fauna. He is also more than capable of participating in discussions on commerce, politics, and international relations.\nBut on a typical day, all you will glean from him is a few pieces of useless trivia, because he particularly enjoys sharing these fun tidbits with you.",
            "Character Story 2\tWhen making a purchase, look to haggle.\nThis is a common understanding among the people of Liyue. No matter what high heavens the store owner praises their product to, no matter its ancient history or classical value, prices are always flexible. Half the stated cost is a good place to start.\nBut when Zhongli pays up (or rather, calls for someone else to pay up on his behalf), he never looks at the price tag. As long as it catches his eye, Zhongli will pay as much as the owner asks. Indeed, he will even buy it at a premium sometimes.\nBut for some reason, Zhongli always forgets to bring money.\nFor small purchases, he has friends to help him out, and large bills he somehow finds ways to have written off.\nTo those merchants who secretly pride themselves on their powers of flattery, Zhongli is a man of strange proclivities: in truth, he knows a great deal about the value of money and finance, and he also understands the suffering of the people. However, he seems to not understand that poverty is part of the human condition.\nOr perhaps it might be said that he cannot imagine himself being poor.\nHow has such a person not died of hunger yet?",
            "Character Story 3\tThere is no way Zhongli can starve.\nSuch concerns as profit and loss are beneath his notice. The Seven Nations and the world itself are where his efforts are directed.\nAs for wealth... He is wealth itself.\nHe is Morax, the overlord Rex Lapis who rules Liyue, and the Geo Archon of the Seven Archons. The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat, Mora, is named after him.\nWhen night falls and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his own hands.\nTo the people of Liyue, Rex Lapis has many divine titles.\nWhen he laid down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of Commerce.\nHe has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historians call him the God of History.\nThousands of years ago, the forebears of the citizens of Liyue Harbor struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create stoves. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.\nPeople from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.\nBut in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most fascinating.\nThe delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a warrior... Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited by their deity at some point — and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history.",
            "Character Story 4\tAs the founder of Liyue Harbor, \"contracts\" are the most important thing to Morax.\nFrom simple monetary exchange and agreements between merchants to the ancient laws that Morax himself laid down, there is no part of city life untouched by \"contracts.\"\nTo merchants, \"contracts\" are the most important standard to which they hold themselves: deadlines, invoices, shipping destinations... Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.\nThus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.\nThrough the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as \"permissible if unaddressed,\" and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.\nAmid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.\nThe person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the \"Tailor of Liyue,\" in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.\nBut no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.\n\"The one who reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tRex Lapis, most ancient of The Seven, has lived far too long.\nRex Lapis still remembers that moment when the final archon took their divine seat, thus ending the Archon War and the era of warring gods. The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding humanity.\nAs time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.\nThe carefree Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest of The Seven.\nWhen Barbatos first came to Liyue, Rex Lapis believed his fellow archon to have encountered some terrible crisis in pursuit of their duties, thus requiring his aid.\nSo when Barbatos descended in a gust of wind, the Geo Archon had already prepared himself to receive this neighboring deity and lend what help he may.\nBut as he looked, the Anemo Archon tossed a wine bottle at him.\n\"Here's some wine from Mondstadt. Care for a taste?\"\nTo forsake one's duty to deliver a single bottle of wine — what a preposterous notion!\nYet the Anemo Archon kept coming to visit, to explore Liyue Harbor, all sorts of strange questions on his lips. The Anemo Archon's questions knew as little limits as the wine in his hands.\nFrom then on, the first Seven would often gather in Liyue.\nRex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.\nThe world has changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory.\nThe seven seats changed and again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.\nNor would the duty of guiding humanity be honored by the new archons.\nEven the hardest rocks may be worn down after three thousand years.\nNor would the wind ever return again.\nOne drizzly day, the ancient ruler was strolling about Liyue Harbor, and overheard a merchant telling one of his workers,\n\"You've finished your duties, go ahead and call it a day.\"\nLong did he stand amidst the milling crowd.\n\"Have I... already finished my duties?\"",
            "That Which Rises From the Sea\tDuring the Archon Wars, every corner of Teyvat was consumed in the fires of conflict. Not only did gods fight amongst themselves, but countless wicked things also sought to expand their domains.\nOne such type of creature caused no end of woe for the Geo Archon, long before he took that title along with his place among The Seven.\nThese foul creatures, straight from the murky depths of the ocean abyss, had a squishy exterior, and possessed agile tentacles that would live on even after being cut off, even secreting some thick and revolting fluid in the process.\nThis alone would have been enough to make them the most monstrous of all creatures, and still it was not the pinnacle of their monstrosity.\nWhat made them so truly terrible was their small size, which gave them the ability to duck into unimaginably small nooks and crannies.\nNo space was too narrow for them, neither the wooden boards of tables and chairs, nor the seams of windows and doors and curtain folds, nor even books and brushes.\nMany a poor soul had, on at least one occasion, unwittingly outstretched their hand, only to quickly retract it in horror with a blood-curdling scream at the sensation of something cold, clammy and damp, while one or more of these despicable creatures came crawling up their arm, leaving a shiny trail behind them...\nAt the behest of the people of Liyue, Morax agreed to wipe these creatures out. But these parasites upon civilization could not be destroyed like enemies on a battlefield, by simply summoning a storm of stone spears that would shatter the earth and churn the soil...\nStill, he was the God of Contracts. His word had to be his bond.\nSo, he went through the town from house to house with prisons of stone, seizing these creatures one by one and locking them away for good...\nThis long campaign of pest extermination taught Morax the true meaning of \"a burden lifted.\"\nThe grueling campaign itself, and the terrible smell of those ocean creatures' secretions, left a lasting impression on the deity.\nToday, even when he goes out incognito as the mortal man, Zhongli, Morax gives those living, squirming seafood products a wide berth.\n...Well, except for dishes where said seafood products have been sliced and diced into oblivion, such as seafood tofu. He'll quite happily eat those.",
            "Vision\tOnce the Rite of Parting, of which Zhongli was both director and star, was over, the Fatui Harbinger named Signora appeared before him.\nBy prior contract, she was here to claim the Geo Archon Morax's Gnosis.\nBefore the Traveler and the two Fatui Harbingers, Zhongli related the truth that he had established a contract with the Cryo Archon.\nIn his own words, this was his final \"Contract to End All Contracts.\"\nYet no matter how one looks at it, the loss of his divine ability to defend Liyue was too great a price to pay.\nEven amongst mortals, the basis of a contract is \"equivalent exchange.\"\nAnd for the God of Contracts, who must have established countless such agreements in his long years of existence, such an important contract must have come with its benefits.\nNow, the Geo Archon has given away his Gnosis as his part of the deal.\nWhat, then, must the Cryo Archon have wagered to balance the scales?"
