            "About Xingqiu\tOh, Xingqiu? I find his written works quite interesting. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has been asking that I cooperate with a different author for greater royalties. Hmph, do I seem the type to be swayed by a few extra Mora?",
            "About Barbara\tBarbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... Albert offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort.",

            "More About Albedo: III\tThe time required to sketch portraits closely correlates with one's mood. I could spend half a day sketching Huffman, while I might only need three strokes of the pencil to sketch Kaeya — one for the face, one for the eyepatch string... and one for the eyepatch.",
            "More About Albedo: IV\tWhat do I do besides sketching and research...? I will occasionally read novels from Inazuma and Liyue. They contain many fascinating ideas which can sometimes provide me with unexpected inspirations for my own creations.",

            "Albedo's Hobbies\tHmm... Besides research, the activity I spend most of my time on is probably sketching. At first I saw it simply as a way to better study the structure of living things and materials so as to aid me in my experiments, but it eventually became a hobby of mine. Indeed, it is a very good way to relax.",

            "Least Favorite Food\tWhat food do I dislike? ...Large portions of meat at restaurants. I have a rather small appetite, so a meal like that only ends up in tragedy — either I overeat and the joy of the taste is lost, or I don't finish it and the food is wasted. I decided to simply not go to restaurants, although that has also meant I must spend more time preparing my own food...",

            "Character Details\tAlchemy is an ancient art, and many of its secrets have been lost to history. The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue.\n\"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!\" Or so most alchemists would protest.\nBut as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy.\nAt least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.\nThis young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Akademiya did not possess.\n\"The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life.\"\nAs if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.\nSeconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand.\n\"And this... is new life.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tAlbedo has a very important job within the Knights of Favonius but does not often appear in public.\nStill, he does not have the strange and eccentric temper that people tend to assume of academics. In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings.\nHe is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm.\nAs a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance.\nOn days when he shuts himself away in his laboratory to focus on his work, or heads out into the wild to gather materials, no one in Mondstadt will be able to find him.\nYet Albedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person.\nHe delights in giving guidance to his assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose.\nHe finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt.\nYet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that Lisa, for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Albedo got into Mondstadt because of his master's recommendation letter.\"\nThis statement is technically true. But Monstadt's gates are open to everyone, and he would have been quite welcome even without the recommendation letter.\nIn fact, Albedo's life in Mondstadt may even have been more comfortable without it.\nThis is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer, Alice, an old friend of Albedo's master, Rhinedottir.\nAfter receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests.\n\"So, Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!\"\nAnd just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.\nThe work of the Knights was actually quite easy for Albedo, requiring only five percent of his energy.\nThe rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal, he thought.\nAnd yet...\nAlice has a daughter, named Klee.\nYes, \"that\" Klee.\n\"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!\"\nFrom that day forth, cleaning up after Klee would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy...",
            "Character Story 3\tAlbedo has no memory of any blood relations. From as far back as he can remember, he was already adventuring deep within domains with his master.\nOf course, Miss Alice, the Knights of Favonius, and that traveler who had a sense of the stellar depths about them... They are all important people. And yet his master is unquestionably the most special to him.\nFor Albedo, she is his only kin.\nShe was a cold and strict woman who raised him and taught him the secrets of alchemy.\n\"The universe is the sable essence of the true starry sky... Earth is the accumulated memory of time and being...\nChalk: that is you. Soil is where alchemy derives its name, and is the basis of all life. And this...\"\nShe demonstrated her technique before him as a huge life form burst from its culture tank in a shower of shattered fragments.\n\"...This is new birth.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tAlbedo once led a simple and content existence.\nThere was no need for him to contemplate anything. Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.\nBut one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.\nAnd with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.\nUpon the note was written: \"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\"\nThe classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.\nIf one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.\nIn the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.\nHe had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.\nBut this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.\nDid this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?\n\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe alchemy that Albedo commands is wholly different from any of the arts practiced in the Seven Nations of Teyvat.\nIts lineage can be traced back to the nation of Khaenri'ah.\nKhaenri'ah was an underground realm, with precious few natural fauna. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.\nThis art of creation was known as \"The Art of Khemia.\"\nAlbedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes.\n The next stage after \"soil\" is \"chalk,\" which was also something his master had mentioned.\n\"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man.\"\nNow, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive.\n\"From soil was birthed chalk.\"\nThe profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.\nSuch ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.\nShe was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her.\n\"I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?\"\nFrom time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment.",
            "Albedo's Artwork\tAlbedo's interest in drawing and painting began back in the days of traveling with his master.\nAt first, he would simply illustrate his notes with basic sketches. But he soon noticed that the process of rendering things in great detail helped him to intimately understand their physical makeup, which was of great utility to his alchemical studies.\nAdditionally, it also allowed him to enter into a pleasant state of clarity, in which he needed only to focus on observation and creating his artwork, and nothing else.\nEventually, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal tuition.\nWhen strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys sketching and painting all manner of living things, but particularly people in moments of joy.\nSometimes, he even gifts his artwork to his unsuspecting models, believing that when a work of art captures a transient moment of enjoyment, it is something worth treasuring.\nAlbedo continued to refine his skills in this manner, going from strength to strength — until one day, when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma.\nHow was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power?\nAmazed, he decided to give it a go himself.\n...Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, \"A Legend of Sword\" was printed and published.\nUnfortunately, it received lukewarm reviews, being lambasted as \"a dictionary with divine illustrations.\"",
            "Vision\tGaining a Vision came as no great surprise to Albedo.\nWhen he received it, he gave it a single glance before continuing to engross himself in his work.\nHe barely felt any wave of emotion at all, as if this was something to be taken for granted.\nAs far as he is concerned, his Vision is merely a tool with which he can more conveniently conduct his research.\nWhat truly sparks joy within him is turning the unknown into the known.\nOne day, he will understand all there is to know about this world — and Visions are no exception."

            "Character Details\tA capable person who keeps a low profile for too long is often perceived as someone with a mysterious identity and ulterior purposes. Alhaitham himself is a powerful rebuttal to all these cliché views: He is a brilliant man, but he is only an ordinary employee of the Akademiya, with a stable job and a cushy house in Sumeru, leading a carefree and comfortable life.\nSometimes, people find it next to impossible to catch the current scribe in his office. Little do they know about the scribe, other than his name, \"Alhaitham,\" and that he is supposed to be present during work hours. The fact is, no one knows his whereabouts, and all they can do is leave documents and files on his desk.\nAlhaitham couldn't be more satisfied with how things are. The man might be at home or in the library, but he'll never appear where people wish him to be.\nHaving an entirely unpredictable schedule affords undisturbed freedom.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe title of a \"scribe\" may sound impressive to most Akademiya students, but this fancy name is just a product of the Akademiya's culture to use unnecessarily high-flown titles.\nIn truth, the scribe does not have to be present at all major meetings, nor does he participate in core decision-making. The scribe is simply responsible for classifying and archiving important documents. However, in Sumeru, where books and manuscript documents were once managed as a resource, the scribe is one of the most \"in-the-know\" people in the entire Akademiya. One can say that this position is rather similar to that of the Grand Conservator — after all, the person who manages texts will have privileged access to profound wisdom.\nAs the current scribe of the Sumeru Akademiya, Alhaitham acts in perfect compliance with his role: He does not attend any non-essential meetings, and when he is required to be present, he only records key points, jotting down other minute details based on his mood. If the meeting does not affect his personal interests or fails to pique his curiosity, he will not be bothered to give any comments. He does make comments, however, when someone has come up with something offensively foolish — and one should expect these comments to be more blunt than necessary.\nSuch is Alhaitham's life philosophy: Whenever the need for his judgment arises, one must be ready to accept any means and privileges he might require to make that judgment. Fortunately for everyone, Alhaitham notes that he is too lazy to possess too many ambitions.\nAll scholars seek knowledge and the truth. Some do so for fame, while others, for ambition. And some others enjoy conquering knowledge and the truth, transcending them, and savoring the sense of superiority in the process. Alhaitham isn't any one of them. He is only driven by what intrigues him. He believes that many scholars have already become lost in their pursuits, taking the truth as a tool or even a shortcut to self-realization.\nHowever, whether one seeks it or not, the truth is always there, hanging high above the sky like an illuminating star. It is not the end of a trip or the destination of a match. It is and shall remain constant, regardless of human existence. Also, human pursuits will not simply end after certain knowledge has been acquired — though people never doubt that they can claim the fruit with joy and are prepared to sacrifice everything for it, their desire for knowledge will keep them going.\nThose who fail to see through the truth set themselves on an endless path, while those with clear minds will say: The truth did not come into being to serve anyone, and whoever is unable to harness their desire for knowledge will be destroyed by it. Such is the rule of the Nation of Wisdom. Of course, if you want to blend in, you are welcome to fake such a posture.",
            "Character Story 2\tTo the people of Sumeru, those who played a part in the operation to save Lesser Lord Kusanali are deemed to be heroes. However, a great many who make such compliments don't really know the full story. They simply repeat a fragment of a tale that they find inspiring. As one of the protagonists in their stories, Alhaitham has no opinion whatsoever about being a \"hero,\" nor does he believe that these stories are worth talking about.\nMeanwhile, Alhaitham has declined the Akademiya's offer to become the Grand Sage multiple times. But given the chaos in Sumeru, Alhaitham eventually agreed to serve as Acting Grand Sage temporarily.\nIt already defied common logic for someone to refuse the titles of Sage and Grand Sage, and yet Alhaitham went further still, resigning and returning to his humble role as Scribe at the agreed-upon time instead of clinging to power.\nIf he did manage to gain anything from it at all, it was the financial benefits: His salary stayed the same after his resignation, not to mention the several high-quality research projects that he was able to complete on his own. There is no doubt, then, that he will lead a well-off life. In addition, his interpersonal relationships have also improved, as he has more or less befriended the other participants in the archon-saving operation — they have gotten close to the point where Alhaitham might greet these people with a nod or two when he sees them.\nSometimes, Lesser Lord Kusanali will also invite Alhaitham to the Sanctuary of Surasthana to discuss various matters. He has met many people there: the General Mahamatra Cyno, the mercenary Dehya, and Nilou, star of the Zubayr Theater. Nilou even once asked him: \"How did you manage to come up with such a bold plan? When I think back on it, we were all quite lucky to not get hurt...\"\nNilou hesitated before she continued, and Alhaitham understood her confusion, for anyone would have wondered how he could have stayed unscathed despite the influence of the Divine Knowledge Capsule. But in Alhaitham's eyes, he was never in danger, for he had never used any capsules.\nAs for how he had managed to do that, it was all thanks to his role as the scribe. As a scholar lucky enough to have read the Akasha's system manual, he had studied the headset and Canned Knowledge, such that he knew how to alter the status signal of the Akasha. He had even once thought of reversing the holographic shield of the Akasha Terminal and projecting it to the back of his head to offer protection from attacks on that front.\nIt has been proven that a plan lays the foundation for everything, and that prior research lays the foundation for a plan. Alhaitham, who had no interest in boasting about how he remained unscathed, answered Nilou's question with another: \"As far as I know, Cyno and Dehya are also curious about this, yet you are the only one who has raised this question. Were they just too shy to ask me themselves?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tAlhaitham seldom discusses personalities or dispositions with others. He believes that the prevalent theories about them are wrong. Suppose someone insists that one's character has nothing to do with their abilities and opinions, the person with such a view will find themselves unable to judge any aspect of another person. A smart person will often hold different attitudes towards a foolish person and another smart person, and the foolish often think differently when facing success and failure. People's views on Alhaitham are proof of this point — given his superb talents and egocentric personality, no one wants to get too close to him, but still, they see him as an outstanding scholar.\nThis is exactly the public image Alhaitham desires. Many scholars are rigid and inflexible, but Alhaitham is not one of them. As a matter of fact, his occasional sarcasm in part reflects his philosophy. Society (or the collective) relies on rules to regulate individuals, and language is one of these regulative tools. Turning language against its original design serves to challenge unreasonable rules, and one can thus stay out of trouble.\nThe word \"talented\" is abused within the Akademiya, and so are \"born differently,\" \"touched by the archon,\" and such... In Sumeru, one's talents are a trial. Outstanding talent is not necessarily seen as a perfect gift, but it also divides people. For instance, to compliment someone with unimaginable achievements, ordinary folk often call them a \"genius,\" or \"superhuman,\" or a \"prodigy\"... But upon reflection, one will soon notice another layer of meaning that even the speakers themselves have not realized: That the talented and the ordinary are categorically different.\nIf someone is capable of things that others aren't, they must have been endowed with some special abilities and gifts. Excessive compliments for and wild imagination regarding outstanding people only serve to alienate them. \"They are successful because they are different\" — such is the typical excuse favored by underachievers. These ignorant notions mean nothing to Alhaitham. Though he does know his way around people, he will not waste his time on such trivial matters.\nRules define borders and set limits. Yet these rules should not be judged solely on the number of people they limit. Therefore, Alhaitham has come up with his own set of rules with which he perceives everything and challenges the world. It is the crystallization of his philosophy. To maintain these rules of his own fashioning, Alhaitham acts on his own will and deals with anything that appears harmful in his eyes.\nOnly with objective judgment can one see the truth. By acknowledging the differences between individuals and recognizing differing levels of capabilities and mental capacities, one will discover the answer right away: Judgment from others is inconsequential, but to leave the right of judgment in others' hands is equal to denying oneself. To be \"different\" should not simply be a label given to you by others. Rather, the talented should have long understood that their uniqueness is also a gift.\nTo put it another way, when a talented person truly understands that they are different and that they are indisputably ingenious, only then can they truly understand the value of their abilities. And as for cowards who remain blinded by perspectives advocated by the great majority, they have not yet found their true selves.",
            "Character Story 4\tTo live a peaceful and comfortable life, one must meet a few requirements first: Congruous personality and logic, adequate fighting prowess, a slow-paced job, and a cushy house in the vicinity of one's office.\nAlhaitham has checked all the boxes above. He would never deny that no place suits him better than the Nation of Wisdom, where social capital is linked to one's academic abilities.\nHis current house, which is located near the Akademiya, is one of the academic resources that he gained through promising research projects. This house's story dates back to Alhaitham's student years. If his classmates still remember him, they will recall that he was not one to mingle with the crowd. As a result, he has only participated in one joint research project. Despite its eventual success, the project resulted in a huge quarrel and a parting of ways. Little do people know about Alhaitham's part in this story, though they might be acquainted with the other protagonist: The Kshahrewar architect Kaveh.\nThis academic incident is not very widely-known — and in truth, the tale of two geniuses falling out due to differing perspectives is an all-too-familiar one in the Akademiya. But even though their collaboration did fall through, neither of them will deny the other party's exceptional brilliance. As for their research, the Akademiya would later transfer the relevant assets to the researchers involved as per regulation.\nAlthough the two did not continue that research, its great success in the early stage still serves as compelling proof of Alhaitham's academic ability. Later, the Akademiya even used this project, which they had forgotten to cancel, as a reference for allocating housing resources, and as such, Alhaitham was given a very decent house befitting his participation in this ingenious project. But the other contributor, Kaveh, had never approached Alhaitham regarding that allocation. It wasn't until later that Kaveh had someone inform Alhaitham and the Akademiya that he was not in want of a house and thus had no use of this property.\nWhen next they met, Kaveh had gone bankrupt. According to Alhaitham, this former friend of his possesses a personality and values that are not congruous with his abilities. The two differ on too many things and cannot reach a consensus even today.\nAllowing Kaveh to stay in this house provides Alhaitham with an interesting research topic: Legally and socially speaking, since Kaveh has previously forfeited the right to his half of this house, he should pay the landlord during his stay. However, paying rent would, to some extent, deny his contribution to the research, which contradicts the academic spirit.\nAn intriguing matter to consider, but Alhaitham has no interest in the answer. Thus, he has taken his broke former colleague in, collects rent as the rightful landlord, and gives his colleague some household chores. He is well aware of the dissatisfaction Kaveh might have, but it matters not to him. As far as Alhaitham is concerned, Kaveh is a familiar face, similarly lacks familial attachments, and is the polar opposite of himself as a scholar — that is to say, an excellent mirror. Human vision is limited, but it can be perfected through the presence of another genius. Taking this opportunity, Alhaitham will be able to observe other aspects of this world and thus understand more things that may have otherwise been unfathomable.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe Nation of Wisdom places academics and knowledge above everything else. As such, a scholar acknowledged by others within the Akademiya usually possesses a higher social status. Alhaitham was born to just such a family of well-received scholars. His parents died very early in an accident, and he was raised by his grandmother, a Kshahrewar scholar.\nAlhaitham doesn't have many recollections of his parents. He learned from his grandmother that they were both employed by the Akademiya, with his father being a mentor in Haravatat and his mother, a renowned scholar in Vahumana.\nAlhaitham has inherited his parents' intelligence, and he was always the sharp kid amongst his peers, so much so that he started reading abstruse academic journals at around the age of seven. Having noticed his exceptional talents, Alhaitham's grandmother suggested that he attend school early. However, it only took half a day in the Akademiya for little Alhaitham to report this back to his grandmother: Everyone he met there was boring and he preferred reading alone to listening to their meaningless courses. Alhaitham's grandmother saw his parents' talents and personalities in him, and agreed to let him stay home to be self-taught.\nTo Alhaitham, \"to be self-taught\" means to read, break down, reorganize, and question. Due to his family background, he was lucky to be exposed to books made of paper. Interestingly enough, he takes more pleasure in reading his grandmother's hard-copy collections than obtaining knowledge from the Akasha directly.\nAs opposed to the Akasha, books are inflexible and rigid, and there is no guarantee that their contents are error-free either. To use such a medium of knowledge is to dance with potential misinformation. The majority of people in Sumeru hate this, but Alhaitham derives great enjoyment from it. It was from reading that he acquired the ability to learn, analyze, and even rectify, and ultimately, he has learned to question. If the rustic and primitive method known as reading is ever any trouble, it is trouble that Alhaitham appreciates.\nAlhaitham's grandmother told him: \"You and your father both like reading. Now, I can't say if the two of you have been given too much share of wisdom or not, but always remember that being different is a gift.\"\nKnowledge is to be recognized, pursued, and trusted, but one should never forget to question it. Perhaps only those who come to such an understanding will not be easily moved by Canned Knowledge and other convenient knowledge media. And only someone who had already met these prerequisites would have casually read the Akasha manual sealed deep within the House of Daena.\nAs Alhaitham's grandmother had said, books contain useless information, and sometimes in large amounts, but his sharp mind will sift through them — and if a book he has read lingers in his memory, it will come in handy one day.\nAfter his grandmother's passing, Alhaitham managed her funeral on his own, inheriting her properties and her small library. Before she passed away, Alhaitham's grandmother gave him this earnest blessing: \"You are such a smart child. Many such people have large egos and a propensity to act on their own. You are outstanding and possess a broader horizon than ordinary people. This is not a bad thing, but you must take care to have a clearer mind than others. You must understand that vain pursuits are but dust, and that you must discern your path with the greatest of wisdom.\"\nLater, Alhaitham applied for the Akademiya and was immediately admitted, scoring high marks in the Haravatat entrance exam. He was informed that his grandmother had also applied for him to be able to attend classes in other Darshans. Following his late grandmother's advice, Alhaitham has always kept a low profile and a clear mind, and always makes decisions for himself.\nYears later, when Alhaitham moved into his new house, he brought all those books over. While sorting through them, he flipped through a few that he had read long ago. The journals that had well-wishes written on their title pages were from his mother's collection, and the ones with reference materials inserted between pages and notes on the margins had once belonged to his father. On top of them, there was a thick book with an exquisite, emerald-colored cover. On the title page, his grandmother had written thus: May my child Alhaitham lead a peaceful life.",
            "The Doer's Belt Pouch\tA sturdy and durable green belt pouch.\nPeople often mistake it for a wide belt, an impression perhaps reinforced by its color being in perfect harmony with Alhaitham's outfit.\nThere are only a few things in this pouch: Keys, some recent read of Alhaitham's, and a portable music player that goes with his headphones.\nAlhaitham personally made the music player when he first became the scribe, and it is connected to the headphones via cables of the same color. He sometimes uses the gadget to play music, and other times, to block noise.",
            "Vision\t\"The value of language is not limited to words. A unified language helps to govern thoughts. Language is the bottom line, rules, weapons, and violence. By making our language unique, we can open up a special path to the relative completion of minds.\nGoverning thoughts may appear meaningless to some, but to others, it has a very significant meaning. Individuals' pursuit of uniqueness gives rise to various languages and media. People are controlled by language under many circumstances.\"\nAs Alhaitham flipped through these pages, reaching the end of the book and its back cover, he realized that an intricate ornament had been underneath the tome this whole time.\nOf course, he knew what it was — a Vision, the proof of one's power. However, this item did not mean much to him.\nA believer might have perceived this divine item to be a thing most lofty, but to him, it was no more than a useful tool.\nAlhaitham was out on a research trip when he was given the Vision.\nHe didn't plan to dwell too much on it. It belonged to him, after all, so what difference would it make if he checked on it tomorrow, as opposed to today?\nAnd just like the knowledge he has acquired, what he has obtained shall always remain in his possession."

As she drew close, she was enveloped by powerful energies, and she saw her own image within the portal as one looking into a mirror, feeling as if she were in two places at once.\nWith a flash of light, the \"world\" that Aloy knew completely disappeared from her sight, and she now found herself in a strange, beautiful new world just waiting to be explored."

            "Character Details\tAmber is an Outrider of the Knights of Favonius. In an age where Outriders are becoming obsolete, she continues on with her responsibilities.\nIt takes a newcomer only a few days to feel right at home with this passionate girl.\nWhether it's before the Good Hunter's signboard, the banks of Cider Lake, or the tree tops at Windrise, one can find traces of this vigilant Outrider in red anywhere. \nOnce spotted by her, no suspicious individual can ever escape her interrogation.",
            "Character Story 1\tFrom a young age, Amber has always had boundless energy and a positive outlook on life.\nEach day, she burns with a fiery enthusiasm that sees her go about her life like a whirlwind, smashing through any obstacle that stands in her way.\nAt times, however, her excessive energy can make her quite the troublemaker.\nNeedless to say, she was quite a handful when she was young. Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on her grandpa's head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a Dendro Slime's leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.\nSomehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.\nTo Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.\nBut it was only on the day that her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years.",
            "Character Story 2\tAmber's grandpa was once the leader of a mercenary group. He came from Liyue Harbor and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed Teyvat. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack; he was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.\nToo ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.\nBefore long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each one of them personally, and began leading them on missions.\nIt also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of Mondstadt and founded a family.\nYears later, Amber was born into that family. During the day, she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the outriders; at night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.\nAmber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew.\n\"When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then, I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?\"\nAs the coarse skin of her grandpa's palm rubbed against her head, a bewildered but earnest Amber nodded energetically in response.",
            "Character Story 3\tSomething happened one day four years ago that profoundly changed Amber.\nThat day, her grandpa left his coat of arms and sword in his office and simply disappeared, leaving no note and telling no one he was leaving.\nHe had been the beating heart and the backbone of the Outrider division, and without his leadership they rapidly became undisciplined and lost their edge.\nA few failed operations later, the Outrider division was facing obsoletion. In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.\nOn top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.\nAmber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.\nShe had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage — and lots of it.\nShe wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.\nBut more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland.",
            "Character Story 4\tLife in the Knights of Favonius was not easy for Amber in the beginning.\nBeing as young as she was and having just lived through the trauma of losing her grandpa, the senior knights made a point of taking special care of her.\nHowever, for a girl as desperate to excel as she was, being taken care of by others implied that she wasn't yet mature enough to stand on her own two feet.\nAccordingly, she voraciously sought out extra responsibilities and made this as visible as possible to her seniors.\nFinally, during an intense engagement with some monsters, the seniors noticed her bravery and resourcefulness in the heat of battle.\nThat was the moment when they realized that their little girl was growing up.\nAs she matured, she also became more at ease with herself. Whatever feedback she met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence, or taunting, her response was always the same.\n\"For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!\"\nAmber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.\nShe firmly believes that she will not disappoint her grandpa.",
            "Character Story 5\tToday, Amber is still the firecracker she always was, burning with endless passion and energy.\nNow that she's all grown up, Amber holds firm to her grandpa's teachings as she spreads her Wind Glider's wings and watches over the City of Freedom with the eye of an eagle and the cautious cunning of a bunny rabbit.\nThe \"Crimson Knight\" is known throughout Mondstadt.\nThe people are delighted to see the mischievous little girl they remember growing up to be a guardian they can rely on.\n\"Never fear, Outrider Amber is here!\"\nHer self-confidence is simply unshakable:\n\"I am Outrider Amber, the one and only outrider — which makes me the best one out there!\"",
            "Amber's Journal\tAmber doesn't make writing a daily diary a habit, only electing to write special or memorable events down in her journal.\n\"I finally caught that magical bird! It's called a Rami... something. I don't remember. But I've been chasing it for three days, and I've only been able to sit down for a proper meal today. That magical bird was a really cunning one, burrowing in the thick forest like that. Good thing I didn't give up! Best of all, Master Jean gave me special permission to pluck a feather plume from it as my reward. Hehe, I'll wear it at my side every single day!\"\n\"I'm sure I followed the cookbook to the letter and grilled the meat for six minutes. But while the outside is charred, the inside isn't cooked yet... Did I not control the heat properly? But I really am hungry, so I'll just have to try again tomorrow. One day, I'll make the best steak, and I'll call it... the Outrider's Champion Steak!\"\n\"I met a strange outlander today. I was suspicious at first, but as it turns out, this outlander is both reliable and capable. Ugh, come to think of it, what would I do if an enemy that strong showed up? ...I musn't fall behind. I must train harder!\"",
            "Vision\tAmber once believed that if she took on her grandpa's post, she would understand why he left Mondstadt.\nHowever, even when she officially became an Outrider, she was no closer to unraveling the mystery behind his wordless departure.\nHer grandpa had left nothing for her to find either, indicating that she would have to forge her own path.\nAmber floundered for a while, until she flipped through an old book of fables that she would eventually come to treasure.\n\"What you lacked was not wind, but courage. It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world.\"\nAmber realized that she shouldn't wait for directions from someone else, but that she should be like those courageous birds that spread their wings and flew into the blue skies.\n\"There must be something that only I can do. There must be.\"\nThe moment she realized this, a Vision began to shine brightly at her hip."

How come he gets his own special ceremony!? Was the hundredth Vision supposed to be, like, stronger than the other ninety-nine, or something? Pff, nah, it can't have been that, 'cause, uh, hello! They would've chosen me if that's what they were going for.",
            "About Kamisato Ayato\tHaha, I only wish I could have met my bro Ayato sooner. He really taught me something. \"You can kindle the warrior spirit in even the weakest of bugs\"... Yep, I really took that one to heart. If it weren't for those words of wisdom, I'm pretty sure I would have given up beetle fighting after losing for the 780th time... Heh, I guess sometimes it takes a warrior to understand a warrior. When we're playing trading card games or battling beetles, we're always totally on the same wavelength.",
            "About Yoimiya\tHmph, she's always showing off her fancy fireworks and toys to the kids. Well, I'm sick of it! Nobody steals my thunder! I'm the one that's supposed to be adored by the kids! Me! That goes for you too, you're siding with me on this, okay... Huh? Whaddya mean, you're not a kid? Eh, details. If you're shorter than me, you're a kid as far as I'm concerned.",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tWord on the street is that he blocked the Musou no Hitotachi after you escaped from Tenshukaku. Seriously? 'Cause I mean, that is awesome! Who knows how he pulled it off. Hey, now that I think about it, he's from a fallen clan, and I'm from a fallen clan... That kinda makes us equals, haha! Yeah, so next time someone attacks you, it's my turn to block the blade!",
            "About the Raiden Shogun\tDuring the Vision Hunt Decree, the Shogun had to send her top tengu in person to get my Vision off me. Heh, means she must have found me to be quite the pain in the neck. But, y'know, she's abolished the Vision Hunt Decree now, so no hard feelings, I guess. As long as she's learned her lesson, of course. 'Cause if she pulls something like that again, this old pain in the neck will be back with a vengeance.",
            "About the Lady with Fox Ears\tI crushed that Kitsune Ramen eating contest we had. Even all that Fried Tofu couldn't stand in my way — she didn't come close to beating me! ... I was, uh, bedridden for more than a month after that, but you know what? I'd rather lie in bed a winner than walk away a loser! So... Anyway, I had the last laugh, 'cause she had to foot the bill for 32 bowls of noodles! Haha!",
            "About Kujou Sara\tYou know what, yeah, she beat me during the Vision Hunt Decree. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When you lose, you admit defeat, and when you screw up, you take it on the chin, like a man! And anyway, let's not forget which one of us won't agree to a rematch — her, the tengu warrior! It's just a sumo street fight, I mean, what's she so afraid of? If she keeps snubbing me, I'm gonna have to stop calling her Kujou Tengu and start calling her Kujou Chicken! Heh, we'll see what she thinks of that.",
            "About Gorou\tOh yeah, the doggy general in the resistance... Hey, I've gotta hand it to him, he may be on the small side, but he's got quite the fighting spirit. Also, he gives off this vibe that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, almost as if he understands my innermost feelings... I mean, I've barely met the guy, so that's kinda weird.",
            "About Kuki Shinobu\tNobody questions my leadership in the gang, what I say goes — except when it comes to Shinobu. She's always challenging everything I say. And not only that — all the hard-earned loot I bring back and share with everyone? She goes and returns it! But also, she gets me out of jail, and out of every mess we get ourselves into, so I'll let it slide. Besides, I don't wanna get on her bad side... An angry Shinobu would make my life a nightmare.",
            "About Sayu\tAll I did was give her a little pat on the head this one time when she wasn't looking, and now, she pounces to attack every time she lays eyes on me. Haha, what can I say? Tanuki are adorable! What am I supposed to do — not pat one on the head? ...Oh yeah, and that's the other thing — she beats you up for calling her a tanuki, too! What's up with that? I mean, a tanuki's what she's going for, right? Sheesh, talk about getting your fur all ruffled over nothing...",
            "More About Itto: I\tI know what you're thinking: \"I don't see it — how did this guy get to become the boss of the Arataki Gang on the back of beetle fighting and trading card games?\" Well, you're right, those are just child's play. Wanna know the hard skills that really got me where I am? Eating ramen standing upside down, sleeping with my eyes open, playing the harmonica with my nose, and swatting houseflies with my hair. Yeah, I know. Betcha see it now, huh?",
            "More About Itto: II\tPeople in Inazuma have this ritual every time there's a holiday, or they move, or get sick, or whatever, where they throw beans around and chant: \"Fortune beans are falling down, send the oni out of town. Fortune in, oni out. Fortune in, oni out!\" ...Ugh, the chant gets worse every time I hear it, but the streets full of beans, with my allergies? Total disaster. I've gotta fix this, for every oni out there! We're innocent, people! Quit trying to ward us off and drive us out every time there's a minor life event!",
            "More About Itto: III\tIn a... \"attempt\"... to end human prejudice toward the oni, I had the gang use a Kamera to take a picture of me showing my softer side and stick it to the Message Board in Inazuma City. Next thing we know, some jerks have graffitied all over it! Tsk! Then, some ashigaru blockheads from the Tenryou Commission accused me of disrupting the peace, next it was the Yashiro Commission, complaining it ruined the atmosphere in the area, and finally, even the Kanjou Commission got involved — they sent some lackeys over demanding advertising tax! Ugh, they have no idea who the bad guys are here!",
            "More About Itto: IV\tIn the Arataki Gang, we're proud to welcome people who've experienced adversity in their lives. Don't listen to the people who call us freaks, or weirdos. Every member of my gang is like family to me, and they all feel the same way. Whatever happens, the gang will face it together — both the highs and the lows.",
            "More About Itto: V\tI gotta respect the Blue Oni for sacrificing themselves so that the Crimson Oni could live on... In principle, though, I'm absolutely against it. No one should have to sacrifice their own kind for the sake of a better tomorrow, period. It's only a better tomorrow if it's a better tomorrow for everyone. We need to work together, not have everyone just focused on themselves, making their own sacrifice, trying to look cool in the process... Eh, I guess there's no changing the past, what's done is done. But from this day forward, no more sacrificing, not on my watch! You go to sacrifice yourself, I'll stand right in your way!",
            "Itto's Hobbies\tBeetle fighting, trading card games, spinning tops, kendama, hide-and-seek, you name it, I can play it! Whaddya say, pick one and we'll have a little contest? Just make sure you're ready to get thrashed! Hahaha!",
            "Itto's Troubles\tGranny Oni isn't an oni at all... In fact, she's the kindest human that has ever lived. She only got her nickname because she took me in.

            "Favorite Food\tLollipops are pretty much the best things ever. The candy tastes awesome, but also, it looks really cool just having a stick hanging out of your mouth. It gives me, like... a real punk kind of vibe. Here, you try it!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tUh, well I am an oni! So there's nothing I hate more than beans. Soybeans, Mung Beans, whatever, I hate 'em all. Just touching one is enough to set off my allergies, let alone eating them. We have to get people to resist this constant urge to throw beans everywhere!",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tHahahahahahahaha! Mm, mm, mm! I haven't eaten somethin' this good in three whole years!",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tWhile walking through Hanamizaka, it is hard not to notice a young man of the oni race named Arataki Itto.\nNever mind his horns or piercing voice sticking out like sore thumbs — the sight of him enthusiastically joining in to play childrens' games is enough to set him apart from the crowd.\nIn any case, his obvious lack of things to do stands in stark contrast to Hanamizaka itself, where craftspeople gather in droves and busy themselves all day long.\nItto claims to be the \"first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang,\" the responsibilities and duties of which he tried to explain to some Tenryou Commission officials when they came to him to investigate a rather harmless street brawl. Unfortunately, they interrupted him not two minutes into the explanation before marking him down as \"unemployed.\"\nThat designation is not exactly accurate, of course: other than the Gang's activities, which the Shogunate does not acknowledge, Itto does also do some odd jobs to stay solvent, usually working one day before taking three days off.\nAs such, a more accurate designation should have been \"three-quarters unemployed.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tObjectively speaking, Itto's reputation leaves much to be desired within Inazuma City.\nEven though he is not considered a villain, he is certainly no law-abiding citizen either. If one really had to assign some sort of hazard level to him, then perhaps the level of being used by parents to keep naughty children in line (\"If you don't behave, Arataki Itto will come and snatch your snacks away!\" for example) might suffice.\nThat said, unlike threats of \"the Great Mujina Youkai grabbing you and taking you deep into the mountains,\" or \"being inlaid upon the Shogun's statue,\" the scenario threatened here can actually occur.\nStill, \"snatching\" is, again, not accurate, for the fate of these snacks is decided fair and square by ritual combat!\nIn the eyes of many, winning snacks off kids in competitions is exceedingly shameless, but Itto believes that every battle must be taken seriously, whether one's foe is a 5-year old child or the Almighty Shogun herself.\nIt is also due to this conviction that Itto can lose to a child without any reservations at all.\nAnd while the adults have much to say about his behavior, the children find Itto the big oni to be a rather good playmate.\nHe is knowledgeable about all manner of street games and plays them all with great gusto. He also stands up for any who are being bullied.\nLately, the children have been very into Onikabuto battles against Itto.\nThe rules of this game are simple and the fighting is both fierce and very watchable. Most importantly of all, they actually have a pretty decent chance of winning this one, unlike with other games.",
            "Character Story 2\tFor the longest time, the Tenryou Commission has regarded the Arataki Gang as a group of only occasional troublemakers who do not require that much attention.\nThis group only has less than 10 regular members and there are many internal disagreements concerning the date of its founding.\nAkira believes that it all began when Itto saved him from a few two-bit ruffians. That day, Itto persisted even after having been knocked to the ground 7 times, ultimately causing the punks to back off in annoyance. Helping Akira up from the ground, Itto declared: \"Well, guess you're with the Arataki Gang now!\"\nGenta and Mamoru believe that the Gang was truly founded at the end of a certain year when they all squatted on the outskirts of Inazuma City and roasted Lavender Melons.\nThat day, not one of them had a single Mora to their name, and they were all very hungry indeed. While gorging himself on a melon, Itto said with a sigh, \"We should roast Lavender Melons like this every year!\"\nThat said, neither Genta nor Mamoru thinks that these experiences need much memorializing.\nFor Kuki Shinobu, the Gang was officially formed the first time she had to drag Itto's sorry behind out of Shogunate gaol, for this was the first time any official records had ever made mention of the Arataki Gang.\nAs for Itto, he believes that the Arataki Gang existed from the first moment those words entered his mind.\nUnfortunately, he no longer remembers when that was.\nAnd as for Granny Oni, who has taken care of Itto since he was young, she believes that the Gang was never formed.\nTo her, these children are just \"Itto and his friends.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tThe land of Inazuma has been home to the oni race since antiquity.\nThey existed here alongside the lordly Hakushin kitsune bloodline and the tengu.\nSuch youkai often have supernatural abilities that humans could only look upon in envy, but the oni lack many special traits in that regard.\nOther than the horns on their heads, they are mostly remembered for their explosive tempers and penchant for making trouble.\nAs for their legendary fear of beans, it has a scientific basis.\nAs it turns out, oni are allergic to beans. However, because the oni bloodline has thinned out greatly over time, most people display only very minor allergic reactions.\nUnfortunately for Itto, his allergies are still pretty severe. Forget eating beans, so long as he makes skin contact with them, Itto will get itchy all over and even find it hard to breathe.\nThis thus makes beans the only thing that the usually carefree Itto is particularly wary of in his daily life.\nFor their part, the Arataki Gang members do not order any dishes made with beans, not even in private, as a mark of respect for him.\nOf all products made with beans, Itto fears Fried Tofu the most — indeed, he even says that the very sight of it leaves him feeling queasy for three days straight.",
            "Character Story 4\tAnd when one mentions Fried Tofu, a certain pyrrhic victory immediately comes to mind.\nThe battle that caused that incident began as a rather pedestrian conflict: a fox-eared lady had happened to sit in the chair that Itto would customarily sit on while eating at his favorite food stand... and on his payday, no less.\nThe two began a contest of words over whom the chair belonged to, culminating in a straight-up (unnecessary) battle.\nItto, hungry from a hard day's work, chose an eating contest, while the fox-eared lady chose a theme of \"kitsune ramen.\"\nItto was momentarily at a loss when he realized that said ramen contained Fried Tofu, but with the oni race's pride on the line, he soldiered on gamely en route to victory nonetheless.\nAnd as for that innocent chair, it was ultimately given to Itto as a trophy by the rather mortified owner of the food stand.\nRegarding the various contests he has been in, there are two that still weigh on Itto's mind quite heavily.\nOne of them is the rematch that he demanded of Kujou Sara, who defeated him and took his Vision as part of her duties in the Tenryou Commission.\nTo this day, the Kujou has not agreed to the street corner sumo match, something that frustrates Itto to no end.\nThe other incident happened many years ago when Itto was young. Then, he had gotten into an argument with a young tengu, the result of which was a sumo match in the Byakko Plain. Unexpectedly, the ensuing furor sent them both rolling down a mountain.\nIn the end, it was the tengu who carried Itto, who could not walk after spraining his ankle, all the way home. Of course, the match went unsettled.\nJust his luck, Itto often thinks, that both such incidents had to do with tengu!\nAlso, how on earth were these tengu all so strong despite looking so skinny?",
            "Character Story 5\tEvery oni child has probably heard the story of the Crimson Oni and the Blue Oni:\nThe gentle, helpful Crimson Oni defeated the wicked Blue Oni, thus winning the respect of the humans.\nThis was Itto's favorite story when he was young, and he was proud of his red oni horns and his Crimson Oni lineage.\nHowever, this simple pride was shaken by a certain incident.\nWhen incidents of robbery occurred in the village in which Itto lived, the Arataki family fell under suspicion on account of their oni heritage.\nItto no longer remembers the details of that incident, but he remembers the wary, disgusted stares the villagers gave him and his parents as they left, and the parting words they said, which Itto has heard countless times since:\n\"Once an oni, always an oni.\"\nNo matter the time period, all oni are the same as far as humans are concerned. In that case, would it not be better to become the Blue Oni, whom people feared? Surely that was preferable to being like his parents, who were driven out despite having done nothing wrong.\nAfter his parents died of illness, the young Itto was turned out onto the streets, where he would lay into anyone who spoke ill of the oni race.\nWell, Itto was mostly the one getting laid into. But he proved quite the pain in the neck, never giving up no matter how many times they knocked him down.\nStill, he was only a child and eventually collapsed on the street due to exhaustion and hunger after a terrible round of beatings at the hands of some ruffians who had banded together against him.\nAt this moment of crisis, Itto was saved by an old human woman.\n\"Why did you save me? Can't you see that I'm an oni?\" \"You must be hungry. Come, I've made some porridge.\"\n\"I told you, I'm an oni! Can't you see them horns?\" \"Oh, I can see them. Do you want some of that porridge, by the way?\"\n\"Agh, you know what, you're not listening to me at all. Oh, alright... One bowl of porridge, please.\" \"Coming right up.\"",
            "The Great Singalong\tAs the year was drawing to a close, the Arataki Gang met to discuss how they might celebrate the turnover of the year.\nAs opposed to more reputable organizations, the Arataki Gang did not have any fixed venues to hold their activities, which posed some... logistical issues.\nThe Lavender Melon suggestion was quickly eliminated. While roasting melons itself was certainly not an issue, eating only that to celebrate the new year certainly was.\nAn Onikabuto festival was considered, but the year's end was not mating season, and so the contestants would not be half as motivated as they usually were.\nUltimately, lots were drawn, and the \"Great Singalong\" was selected.\nThis activity was suggested by Itto himself, and it entailed everyone standing on a cliff and singing against the ocean wind to express their innermost feelings and well-wishes for the future.\nThe various gang members actually rejected this in their hearts when they found out about it. After all, screaming into the wind was nowhere near as fun as eating melons. Kuki Shinobu even indicated that she would like to take leave to return home on that day.\nHowever, the event went through nonetheless. The yelling and hollering were indeed quite soothing for the soul — and as things unexpectedly turned out, Itto was quite the good singer as well.",
            "Vision\tItto's Vision was something he found under his hip after waking up one morning. By that point, he had already been in Hanamizaka for many a year, and his livelihood was at least somewhat stable.\n\"Well I never! Dad, Mom, Gramps, Granny, and Granny Oni, this... Now isn't this something?\"\nThese were Itto's real thoughts as he first looked upon his Vision.\nThat day, he would excitedly show his Vision to every person he met, even showing people where it had made an indentation on his back until everyone was thoroughly sick of hearing the story.\nA few days later, however, the story would change a little:\n\"Now as you know, I wasn't surprised at all when I first saw that Vision. I mean, you'd expect as much out of the first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang, after all!\"\n\"More importantly, a person's worth isn't something that can be determined by a mere Vision, oh no, sir!\"\nThe keen-eyed, however, would notice that Itto had bought a very soft spectacle cloth.\nAlso, a certain question showed up in the advice column of the \"That's Life\" magazine that went like this:\n\"Ms. Hina, how should I best take care of my Vision and make it shinier? And when I say 'shinier,' I mean shinier than everyone else's, of course!\"\nWhen gang members read this and excitedly showed the magazine to Itto, they were surprised to see the long-time fan of Ms. Hina just look at the mag casually before laying it aside."

            "Character Story 1\tEvery citizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara.\nHowever, this has not always been the case. At first, Barbara's songs sounded strange to the citizens of Mondstadt, and many struggled to see the appeal.\nThis was because for the longest time, the folk songs of bards were the only popular songs known in Mondstadt.\nFortunately, Mondstadt stayed true to its reputation as the City of Freedom, and the people ultimately embraced the new while continuing to cherish the old.\nPeople accepted Barbara's songs, and over time her positive energy rubbed off on them. Soon, they could be heard humming her tunes all around Mondstadt.\n\"Albert, would you stop please! You're completely out of tune!\"",
            "Character Story 2\tBarbara's feelings on her own success are mixed.\nTo the extent that an idol's duty is to make everyone adore her, she has done a fantastic job.\nThere is no doubting that she has made the right choice.\nHowever, an idol is also expected to spread joy and relieve people's spiritual fatigue... Has she really accomplished that?\nShe sang for blind Glory, encouraging her to believe that her lover would one day return. She sang, too, for sick Anna, promising her that her illness would one day be cured.\nYet, the smiles on their faces never last long after the songs end.\nThis has led Barbara to become somewhat disillusioned and doubtful.",
            "Character Story 3\tBarbara has always been a bright and optimistic girl since she was young. Though at times she can be a bit clumsy and mess things up, she always bounces right back and has another go.\nBarbara is the complete opposite of her sister, who is seen by all as the pride of her family.\nUnlike Barbara, her sister has always been the very definition of success in all aspects.\nInitially, all Barbara had ever wanted was to surpass her sister in at least one thing, even if only once.\nHowever, be it swordplay, her grades, or anything else, she was never able to compare.\nEven for someone as optimistic as her, she found herself to be upset and down.\n\"Hard work is the most miraculous magic. But when even that doesn't work... what then?\"",

            "Character Story 5\t\"Thank you\" are the two words that Barbara hears most often.\nWhen she feels lost, she will suddenly find that there is someone wanting to hold her hand.\n\"Thanks for being here with me. I feel so much better.\"\nTo Barbara, the greatest reward is seeing the smiles on people's faces.\nTherefore, whenever she is massaging her swollen calves or drinking tea to care for her sore throat, Barbara recalls all those who have been kind to her.\n\"It's the encouragement I receive from others that keeps me going.\"\nJust maybe, the smiles she receives are proof that her songs really can heal people.\nHer ambition to surpass her sister and become the most popular person in all of Mondstadt hasn't been abandoned by Barbara, it is simply buried deep inside her heart.\n\"If only I excelled more, perhaps I could be of help to Jean.\"\nThis is what she believes.\n\"Okay... Go Barbara, go!\"",
            "Alice's Idol Magazine\t\"...Idol?\"\nThe first time that Barbara heard this strange word, she was visibly confused.\n\"But... aren't The Seven the ones that people are supposed to worship?\"\n\"Yes, but not exclusively...\" replied Alice, an elder of the Hexenzirkel, as she groomed the young girl for stardom. \"Read this, it contains everything you will need to know.\"\n\"Idol Magazine\" was the name of the assigned reading material. Barbara had no idea what world this magazine had come from, but by reading it she found out that there was indeed such thing as an \"idol,\" and that it mainly involved working hard at getting everyone to like you.\nShe also discovered that an outstanding idol is capable of not just bringing joy to themselves, but also bringing spiritual healing to others through the power of song and dance.\nBarbara set about learning one new song after another, dancing to the beat as she went. Finally, she found happiness, and she found it in the smiling faces of others.\nSome time later, when Alice anxiously relayed to Barbara that plans for \"Teyvat Idols!\" were falling through, Barbara was starting to make a name for herself through her performances in Mondstadt.\n\"Hmm... Well, if I'm the only one left... I guess you can leave it to me to define what it really means to be an idol!\"\nDriven by this ever so slightly selfish ambition to spread joy and healing to others, Barbara is slyly swotting up on new tunes behind the scenes to this very day.",
            "Vision\tThe story of how Barbara obtained her Vision is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.\nShe had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever.\nNothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.\nSomeone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family.\nAnother suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.\nBarbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?\n\"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need,\" Barbara thought to herself.\nAnd so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew.\nIt was an unceremonious beginning to her singing career. After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.\nNevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.\nEarly the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.\nBarbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.\nBarbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tBeidou is the leader of The Crux — an armed crew based in Liyue Harbor.\nAn armed crew means exactly what it sounds like: a crew of sailors armed to the teeth.\nWithout getting into too many details, everything The Crux does is approved by the Qixing... more or less.\nBeidou is a trusted leader, so much so that her crew believes her capable of taming the storms and billows on the sea.\n\"It's Beidou! Even the mightiest of storms must bow its head to her might!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tBeidou is something of a cultural icon in Liyue.\nThough her fame does not quite reach the same lofty heights as that of the Liyue Qixing, one can be certain that every merchant in the city knows her name — and that of her crew, The Crux.\nNaturally, there are rumors abound regarding someone of her status. People love to tell epic tales of her earth-shattering (or rather, sea-splitting) feats. Tales in which her abilities are exaggerated to almost superhuman levels.\nOne rumor is that she can channel Electro energy with her sword. It is said that she once used it to cut a formidable sea monster from the depths of the ocean abyss in half with just one hit.\nBystanders who overhear such tales generally dismiss them as drunken ramblings. But to anyone who has ever voyaged with Beidou themselves, these stories are no joke. In their view, if this world really were home to a giant sea monster from the ocean abyss... Beidou would certainly be capable of cutting it in half.\nIn summary, Beidou's abilities are every bit as impressive as her reputation in business circles. So if you hear her lauded as the Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean — suffice to say that there is no smoke without fire.",
            "Character Story 2\tBusiness people tend to put profit before their humanity. This is just accepted as the way of the world. At most, it makes for some light verbal sparring at the dinner table.\nBut things are different in Liyue, where everyone is involved in business. They reject the notion entirely, claiming that Liyue Harbor is a special place where humanity is sacred.\nForeign merchants will retort that the only thing special about Liyue is that \"They've managed to commodify humanity, too!\" To this, Liyue locals respond, \"Then how do you explain The Crux?\"\nWith The Crux having made a name for itself over many years, its services are extremely expensive to charter. And yet, on one voyage when The Crux encountered a strong storm, Beidou noticed a small private boat nearby. Seeing the way it was tossed about by the waves, she ordered her crew to tow the boat to safety — despite the risk that her ship's keel might give way. What little food and water the fleet had left, Beidou shared with the rescued crew as she navigated her vessel onward through the raging storm.\nFinally, after several days, The Crux delivered the rescued boat to a safe mooring spot. Grateful to Beidou for saving their lives, the crew of the rescued boat became her loyal trade partners thereafter.\nAfter Liyue locals recount this story, they smile and insist, \"When you have someone risking their life like that, you can be sure that it takes far more than commodification to explain their actions! Would you really dare to look Beidou in the eyes and talk about the commodification of humanity?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tWord has it that The Crux's boss behind the curtains is none other than the Qixing's Tianquan, Ningguang, herself.\nBoth of the people involved deny this outright, though they do so for different reasons.\nAs a member of the Qixing, Ningguang often needs someone else to do her dirty work for her. Of the many candidates available, she picked Beidou.\nNingguang would emphasize that she picked Beidou, not The Crux. Ningguang's collaboration with The Crux is, therefore, purely incidental.\nMeanwhile, when Beidou hears the rumors about her dealings with Ningguang, she furiously insists that she collaborates with Ningguang on an equal footing: Beidou is her own boss and no one, not even Ningguang, is sitting in the background pulling the strings for her.\nBeidou is certainly unique among Ningguang's collaborators.\nShe does not tread carefully or show reverence in the way that most of them do. In fact, one could even say Beidou is sometimes at odds with Ningguang.\nNingguang's advisers worry constantly that Beidou is too unpredictable and too much of a maverick. But Ningguang simply smiles and dismisses their concerns.\n\"On the contrary, Beidou is the most reliable person in Liyue,\" she replies. \"Just tell her the truth, as well as what's in it for her, and she'll come around in her own time.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tOnce, after disembarking from a long voyage, The Crux held its customary three-day celebratory banquet. The autumn was like any other before it — except for the new chef in town. This was Xiangling, the head chef-to-be of the Wanmin Restaurant.\nLooking to keep costs down, they lured Xiangling onboard after meeting her on the streets, by hook and by crook. When she saw Beidou, Xiangling was dismayed, and let Beidou know this in no uncertain terms: \"If you want to have Yue-style seafood, then I can't agree to help you. I'll have you know that I intend to transcend Liyue's two warring culinary styles with my cooking...\"\nBeidou merely smiled and gestured to the chest of gold coins beside her: \"Just do what you're good at. We made quite a bit on our last run. How does a retainer of fifty thousand Mora sound?\"\nNot one to shy away for a chance to prove the worth of her cooking, Xiangling took the job.\nWhen the day was done, Beidou was indeed won over by Xiangling's skill. She declared in front of her crew that Xiangling would soon be a renowned chef throughout Liyue. She also insisted that they refer to her as \"Madam Xiangling.\"\nHaving only begun to make her name, Xiangling admired Beidou for her generosity with money and her direct personality. Thereafter, Xiangling would sail with Beidou often, looking for new and exotic seafood ingredients. She found herself surprised by Beidou's vast knowledge of seafood and their culinary preparation, given how far she usually was from any kitchen.\nOf course, that didn't mean Xiangling would necessarily heed Beidou's advice on whether something was edible or not...but that is a story for another time.",
            "Character Story 5\tSome say an object takes after its master.\nThough it may not be a suitable description, The Crux crew does indeed take after Beidou, exhibiting the same qualities.\nHowever, there are still secrets among the crew, spreading in places unnoticed by Beidou.\nHer First Mate always takes new sailors out after their first safe return for drinks and fills them in on the details of an old story:\nIn the past, the crew went on a journey to brave the unknown seas and found itself at death's door in a horrific storm.\nAt that time, Beidou stood on the deck behind the wheel, singing a Liyue fishermen's song in the storm.\n\"...all the way until the waves died down and dawn broke on the far horizon...\"\nThe First Mate often ends the story with this final line and a look of longing on his face.\nAs business grew and the crew expanded, more and more outrageously incredible details were added to the story, making the rookies worship Beidou like a goddess.",
            "Pier Laborers' Gossip\t1. Facing a three-headed hydra of unrivaled girth, Beidou hurled forth her greatsword. Spinning in the air, it sliced clean through all three of the hydra's vertebrae, before returning to her waiting hand.\n2. Beidou has beaten Ningguang at chess. Twice. The important part is not so much that she did win Ningguang's money, but more that she dared to.\n3. Since the day she slew the sea monster Haishan, Beidou has never sung a fishermen's shanty ever again.\n4. Yes, Beidou knows shanties. But don't you dare ask her that to her face. I mean, you know how that hydra ended up, don't you...",
            "Vision\tLiyue and Inazuma share a common saying: \"Its fins formed the ocean deep, its tail the mountains high.\" The fishermen learned this phrase while ashore long ago, and sang it over and over, spreading the tune far and wide till it became the much-loved song people know today. Whenever the mists gather over the sea's surface, one can hear the distant song of the fishermen hidden in the white shroud: \"its fins formed the oceans deep, its tail the mountains high...\"\nThis was Beidou's childhood lullaby. The tale of Rex Lapis smiting the sea monsters had become legendary among the people of Liyue. As a child, Beidou loved tales like this, and in her dreams, she thought: One day, I want to see this big fish too.\nThis day, however, she sang this song with a different emotion in her heart. Her entire crew sang along as they sailed.\nHaishan was in the waters with them — at once like a dragon and a fish, it was larger than any could have imagined in their worst nightmares, and mighty as a deity, raising waves dozens of meters high with ease.\nAll who ply their trade on the high seas are destined to meet Haishan eventually. Beidou had longed to do so since she was nine, dreaming of slicing its head off in a single blow.\nMany times she had challenged the creature, and many times she had failed. But this day was different. This day she charged at Haishan with her best greatsword in hand, and crack sailors at her back.\nThe battle would rage fiercely for four days. With cannons and harpoons, arrows and ropes the fleet would assail Haishan, while Beidou battled the thusly tied-down creature for ten hours, well into the night.\nNow, nighttime was when Haishan was in its element, and in their vigilance not a single member of the fleet dared sleep a wink. Beidou stood upon the prow, listening to the wind.\nOne strike. Just one strike. That was all she needed. And so she waited, unmoving, in the freezing wind.\nThen, at the crack of dawn, having neither eaten nor drank throughout the night, Beidou heard a change in the sound of the waves.\nWith one almighty strike that sounded as if it could have sliced the moon in two or ripped a mountain from the face of the world, she chopped the leviathan's head clean off!\nThe sound of thunder filled the heavens, and a single bolt of purple lightning struck the ocean right in front of Beidou, even as she bathed in the blood of her nemesis.\nThus descended a Vision to the slayer of the sea monster, its violet glow as stunning as lightning, and its immaculate, jeweled form a treasure more precious than dragon blood. A suitably divine gift for the hero who subdued Haishan."

I have such terrible luck all the time, and yet I was rescued against the odds and survived all this time. It's a miracle if you ask me.",
            "More About Bennett: III\tYou've, uh, noticed then... Heh. Yeah, Benny's Adventure Team has been me on my own for a long time now. Reason is, I have such bad luck that even the most benign of adventures end up turning into the adventure from hell, and no one wants to come with me... Do you feel the same way?",
            "More About Bennett: IV\tI was born unlucky. That's just the way it is, and I've lived with it so long now that I'm just used to it. But you know what? Maybe it's a good thing. It means I know that whatever luck I do have left is gonna run out sooner rather than later... so I'd better make the most of my life while it lasts. You know, go on plenty of adventures, meet loads of people... I mean, if I didn't live like that, I may never have even met you! Can you imagine? Haha!",

Once the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild becomes the biggest branch in Teyvat, I wanna go adventuring all over the whole world! Benny's Adventure Team will be the greatest adventure team there ever was, because you and me are the greatest adventurers! ...\"Since when?\" Uh... I don't remember exactly when you signed onto Benny's Adventure Team. But whatever, it's just details, right?",
            "Bennett's Hobbies\tI like all kinds of things, but most of all, I like adventures! One day, I'm gonna find the most valuable treasure in the whole world, and then my dads can have a better life... and the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild will be back in business!",
            "Bennett's Troubles\tHmm... Well, if you really wanna know... When I have a bad day, I feel a bit glum. Like, it sucks when I come back empty-handed from an adventure, or when one of my dads' old injuries starts acting up. But... they're just small things, really. After a good night's sleep, I forget all about them. New day, new start! Haha!",
            "Favorite Food\tMeat! Meat is the best sustenance there is. Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, Steaks, and Sweet Madames are all my specialties. You won't go hungry if you come adventuring with me, that's for sure!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tYou can't really afford to be picky as an adventurer. That said, I can't really handle spicy food. I find it hard to breathe after eating Jueyun Chilis, like the spice went right into my lungs. And there's no avoiding the diarrhea afterward... It's the devil's fruit, I say. Who knows where it came from?",

The event seemed to have left him with a broken heart.\nAnother member, Royce, heard someone shout \"Heyo!\" before losing consciousness in a huge explosion. The culprit, Klee, was sent to the confinement room for seven days for mistaking the cave the adventurers were still exploring in for a giant rabbit hole and blowing it up.\nHeckler suffered from a severe bout of diarrhea for a week after joining the team. Although it turned out to be food poisoning, he insisted it was because of Bennett's bad luck.\n\"They'll be back! They're just... on leave. Please don't invalidate my team's registration with the Guild...\"\nSeeing Bennett beg and plead before her eyes, Katheryne sighed and decided to spare him the truth that his \"teammates\" had long jumped ship.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere was once a predicament of incomparable despair.\nA predicament that had all but swallowed an old adventurer.\nThe scorching flames scalded his skin, the deafening thunder almost ruptured his eardrums, and the hollering winds threatened to rip his soul from him.\nAt the end of his hellish journey, what awaited him was... a baby.\nThe old adventurer thought he was the first living thing to pass through this arduous ordeal. But how could he explain that which lay before him?\nIn that moment, it hit him, and he believed it to be true.\n\"This baby must be... a child abandoned by the world itself.\"\nThough there were no mighty artifacts, jewelry, or gold, the old man's face did not seem disappointed in the slightest, for he regarded this baby, whose life hung by a mere thread, to be his treasure.\n\"This child is what I was meant to find on this journey,\" he thought as he took the baby into his arms.\nEven if what he was about to do opposed the will of the world itself, he was unafraid.",
            "Character Story 3\tThe old adventurer died from severe injuries before being able to tell this story, leaving only the child he had saved.\nOn his deathbed, he only managed four final words: \"will,\" \"adventure,\" and \"final treasure.\"\nSeveral single, childless, old adventurers in the Adventurers' Guild in Mondstadt raised the child as their own and named him Bennett.\nBeing raised by the Guild, Bennett referred to everyone as \"Dad.\"\n\"Dad, your dentures fell into the bowl!\", \"Dad, you should stop wearing that old leather armor. Where are the undergarments I bought you?\", \"Dad, it's raining, better keep your distance from me so you don't get struck by lightning!\"\nTaking care of all his aging dads who have no family has taken up most of his time outside of adventuring.\n\"The dads certainly have found a treasure, haha!\"\nCyrus, the current Guild Master, laughed, giving Bennett a pat on the back.\nThough he is unlucky himself, he can at least try to bring luck to those he cares about. At least, that's how Bennett feels.\nBennett the Unlucky still strives to find his own lucky treasure through his series of unfortunate events.",
            "Character Story 4\tOz the Raven, Fischl's familiar, said Bennett is \"the most tenacious young man in the world.\"\nIndeed, Bennett's share of bad luck throughout his life can be seen from his scars, old and new.\nAttacked by monsters, buried in collapsed ruins, falling from cliffs... A wealth of \"unfortunate events\" has taught Bennett how to deal with more of them in the future.\nBarbara, the Deaconess at the Church of Favonius, was once surprised by how skilled Bennett is at treating dislocated joints.\nAnother gift from his ordeals is his jaw-dropping talent for combat.\n\"Look at his moves... Doesn't that hurt?\" Grand Master Varka of the Knights was extremely intrigued after seeing Bennett in combat.\nIt's not that Bennett doesn't feel pain — he has simply gotten used to it. He adapted to the pain as others would to pungent smells or blinding light.\nTherefore, the way Bennett dives into battles head-on without reservation has become a signature of his.",
            "Character Story 5\tWhat does death mean, exactly? Always walking the thin line between life and death, Bennett can't help but wonder.\nBennett knows that the old adventurer who saved him has left many praiseworthy stories and legends after his death.\nHe knows that adventurers will not have weeping at their funerals, only toasts made in their names by old comrades.\nHe knows, to the adventurers of Mondstadt, a \"good death\" comes at the end of a life given to the pursuit of treasure and the secrets of the world. Once over, their souls are brought back to their homeland by Barbatos.\nHe once feared death.\nHowever, after pondering on this matter some more, he now feels death may be something fortunate for an adventurer...\nNot that fortune has anything to do with him.\n\"Onto the next treasure!\" And with that, Bennett puts this thinking business behind him.",
            "Adhesive Bandage\tWhenever he suffers severe injuries such as fractures or excessive loss of blood, Bennett will go to the Cathedral to seek treatment from Deaconess Barbara.\n\"Sorry, it's me again...\" Bennett will say, scratching the back of his head.\nBarbara, however, will just shake her head, and with a \"let's deal with those scratches as well,\" she will toss him some adhesive bandages.\nSuch displays of concern may be inadvertent, but they have a special place in Bennett's heart. He sticks those bandages on his wounds with the care of one pinning a medal to their chest, before thanking her wholeheartedly.\nBennett keeps many such bandages in his utility pouch when he goes on adventures. Ones he gets from his dads, from Barbara, from Katheryne... and from adventurers he sometimes meets by chance after getting injured.\nThese tiny tokens of goodwill form a tangible collection of fair fortune unique to Bennett.\n\"Well, since everyone's by my side, I guess I'm not that unlucky after all.\"",
            "Vision\tBennett's passion for adventure is unstoppable.\nHe wants to constantly explore, challenge, sweat it out, and eventually grow old on the adventurer's path.\nBut there was once when he met with a true crisis.\nJust as that old adventurer had so long ago, Bennett was in a predicament that would cause any other person to despair.\n\"Losing this much blood... Not good.\"\nBut Bennett did not stop. \"There's no reason to turn back,\" he thought.\nSomehow, he just knew that all the agonizing misfortune he had suffered up till this point was for the sake of overcoming this precarious position.\nBut at the end of his hellish journey, what he found at the end was — nothing at all.\n\"Ha, returning empty-handed is... part of an adventure. I... don't mind...\"\nAt last, his tightly-wound emotions came loose, allowing his many injuries to rob him of his consciousness, and he collapsed.\nWhen he reawakened, he found that his wounds had been cauterized by a mysterious flame, stopping both the bleeding and the pain.\nA jewel pulsed warmly in the palm of his hand, its rhythm in time with the heartbeat in his chest — the beating heart of an adventurer.\nThis was not the mercy of the world, or that fate took pity on him. Rather, this was his \"final reward,\" one befitting a person with Bennett's burning passion."

Today, I am grateful to now hold this duty. It is what I was born to do.",
            "About Candace: Parents\tMy father was a scholar from the Akademiya. He originally came to Aaru Village on a research trip, and then he met my mother...

            "More About Candace: III\tEven now, there are those who hold on to a belief that King Deshret will be resurrected. But it's not possible. The past is but grains of sand, scattered to the four winds. The best we can do is to let go, and leave the wind to carry them to their final resting place.",
            "More About Candace: IV\tMy shield? Well, according to what people outside the village say, it has the blessing of Bennu. With this shield in hand, all the grains of sand are my eyes and ears, and the desert is ready to do my bidding... Their imaginations can get a little carried away sometimes. But anyway, that aside, the main thing for me is it always works like a charm.",
            "More About Candace: V\tI'd really love to look into your future with my amber eye, if I could...

            "Candace's Troubles\tEvery now and then, a few violent thugs make the mistake of trying to disrupt the peace and tranquility of Aaru Village. I do wonder... is chasing them into a monster-infested valley perhaps a little too... merciful? What do you think, do you have any better ideas on how they should be dealt with?",
            "Favorite Food\tTo me... quantity is more important than taste when it comes to food. Life in the desert uses up more energy than you might think. After a day's work, there's nothing more satisfying than having a filling meal.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI don't hate it, but compared to regular meat, eating fish is a real nuisance... Maybe it's because we don't really eat fish here in the desert, but for whatever reason, I'm just not very good at removing all those prickly little bones... This must sound ridiculous to you.",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tI learned to wield the spear and shield knowing that I would one day need them, and today I use these skills to protect the village. So perhaps this new strength I now gain in the present is preparing me for trials that lie ahead in the future.",

            "Character Details\tCandace, who has heterochromatic eyes, serves as the guardian of Aaru Village.\nCandace always shows the greatest kindness to all travelers visiting the village, and she will not pursue an inadvertent faux pas so long as that person corrects themselves in time. In Candace's view, the village rules are the most important thing. So long as these boundaries are respected, anyone can be allowed to rest in Aaru Village.\nBut woe betide those who regard this tolerance as weakness. Those who try to do anything illegal in Aaru Village will definitely pay the price.\nBy then, they will find that Candace's lance and shield truly are the most frightening of weapons.\nThe scion of Al-Ahmar, a member of desert folk, the Guardian... Candace, burdened as she is with multiple identities, also bears the eternal responsibility of guarding Aaru Village.\n\"This village only welcomes those who can follow the rules.\"",
            "Character Story 1\t\"Aaru Village is the final refuge for King Deshret's descendants.\" \n\"The mission of the Aaru Village's Guardian is to guard the village till the last of King Deshret's people fade away.\"\nWhen Candace was officially appointed as the new \"Guardian\" at the tender age of eight, the one who handed the position over to her admonished her as such.\nWith King Deshret's death, it was already a blessing that his descendants might have such a refuge from the world.\nAnd so, generation after generation, the Guardians take up their duties in silence, defending countless villagers until they pass on as the \"descendants of King Deshret\" and gain eternal peace.\nIt was once the common wish of the residents of Aaru Village to fade away in peace, sequestered in their village.\nHowever, when new life emerges in this ancient village... Everything that they used to know might just have to change a bit.",
            "Character Story 2\tWhen Uncle Anpu, the village head, announced that a caravan from Sumeru City was about to arrive in the village for trade, the former Guardians could hardly believe their ears.\nThey indignantly accused Uncle Anpu of undermining tradition and requested that Candace, the current Guardian, do her duty by summoning guards to drive the merchants out.\nHowever, Candace refused the request, for she had already reached an agreement with the village head that the village must make changes for the future of its residents.\nThey kept explaining, but the former keepers did not relent, and it was even suggested that if Candace was unwilling to do her duty, they would take up arms again and carry out a Guardian's work themselves. At last, a clang of lance against shield silenced all the quarrels. With lance and shield in her hand, Candace stood up and looked around with a smile, before announcing to the stunned elderly folks around her:\n\"It is good to see you all in such good spirits.\"\n\"But I am the current Guardian of Aaru Village, so please, go and rest, as you should.\"\nThe persuasive power of weapons trumped words at this moment, and it seemed that it would be enough to end the fracas.\nAfter a moment's preparation, Candace accompanied the village head in her station as Guardian to formally receive the caravan and hold trade negotiations with them, before personally escorting them out of the village.\nA few days later, the merchants visited again and completed this seemingly humble transaction regarding cloths.\nThis batch of merchants returned to Sumeru City with news of the success of the deal. Soon after, a new topic cropped up among the business-folk of Sumeru, one which had been rarely heard of in the past:\n\"Hey, you know what? Someone went to Aaru Village to do business — and they made a good sum of Mora, too. Think we should give it a shot next time...?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tIn truth, Candace doesn't often use her lance and shield as debating tools.\nThe children in Aaru Village have always believed that \"Big Sis Candace\" will only frown no matter how angry she is — at most, she might ask the children in trouble to copy the calligraphy prepared for them by Grandma Kulsoom several times.\nThe other guards in Aaru Village believe that although Candace's requirements are strict, she will not give out corporal punishment to those who slack off or whose physical abilities are not up to par, and that she will simply guide them with more care instead.\nThe older folks in the village, for their period, note that Candace is a person who will not let negative emotions show on her face, and indeed, she has never once looked sad in front of them.\nEven the merchants who visit the village will be received by Candace with the utmost hospitality. From introductions to accommodations, she arranges everything in good order.\nPerhaps she might even be too gentle for the merchants' comfort.\nAfter all, this village is next to Great Red Sand. Leaving the monsters aside, lawless bandits must have long had this village in their sights.\nIs the Guardian truly capable of protecting everyone... and their business as well?\nOne night, a drunken merchant dared to ask:\n\"Guardian, we can do business in this village, no problem. But as you know, this desert is a real den of outlaws...\"\n\"You need not worry about this. Only those who obey the rules shall be guests in Aaru Village. As for those who don't...\"",
            "Character Story 4\tThose who do not respect the rules shall be the \"enemies\" of Aaru Village.\nWhether they be Eremites hiding in the sands, bandits disguised as adventurers, or Treasure Hoarders attempting to steal goods... Anyone who dares to invade the village, no matter how they may try to hide and escape, will eventually receive the punishment they deserve.\nThose who sincerely confess their guilt will be forgiven and given enough supplies to cross the sands, but never again will they be permitted to show their faces around Aaru Village.\nAs for the more recalcitrant sort... Their despicable souls shall find company only with the desert sands.\nA former member of the Eremites once warned his companions that Candace, the terrifying Guardian of the village, is a true descendant of King Deshret.\nThe shield in her hand possesses the blessing of Al-Ahmar, such that as long as its wielder holds it tightly, every grain in the great desert will heed her call. So if Candace so wishes, she could even send forth a huge sandstorm to engulf all her foes.\nNot only that, her amber left eye can also perceive the future and read the fates of others. Indeed, such is her terrible might that none can ever escape her pursuit.\nSuch are people's beliefs concerning Candace, that she has swept all of Aaru Village's enemies away by virtue of these divine powers.",
            "Character Story 5\tOnly Candace herself knows that she has never really felt the blessing of Al-Ahmar.\n\"The Guardians have never been blessed by the grace of god\" — this is a secret handed down from Guardian to Guardian.\nOnly when a new Guardian takes up their shield will they be told the truth.\nThe effects of the truth on those now in the know has varied. Some gave up and became so despondent that they stopped practicing martial arts. Some came to believe that since they were not being watched, they didn't have to obey the rules either, and so acted recklessly, even in violation of the law.\nBut Candace was not depressed.\n\"My lance and shield are not wielded as a prayer for a god's blessing.\"\n\"My duty will not change, regardless of whether any god favors us or not.\"\nShe practices diligently day after day and through this has forged both an extraordinary will and martial skills.\nMany who have visited Aaru Village have extended invitations to Candace, wondering why someone as capable as her would choose to live in such an inconspicuous place. If she was willing to leave, they often say, she may yet be able to start a new career...\nYet Candace always answers them thusly:\n\"A Guardian will not leave what they have purposed to protect.\"",
            "Candace's Trinkets\tCandace often buys all kinds of trinkets from merchants who visit Aaru Village.\nHairpins adorned with aquamarine beads, headbands made of silk and satin, gilded necklaces, metal bracelets engraved with Kalpalata Lotus patterns, pendants with the emblems of the Akademiya's Darshans drawn upon them...\nWhile Dehya has encouraged her to dress up more often and use the Mora she spends on herself, Candace feels that some things are too fragile to survive her daily work environment, and so she puts them deep in her wardrobe.\nSo it seems that these trinkets will come in handy only when Candace temporarily puts her duties aside and changes into other clothes to have a rest in the shade — or perhaps she might just give it to a friend as a gift.",
            "Vision\tWith outsiders pouring in, Aaru village was faced with a variety of unprecedented circumstances.\nThey now had Treasure Hoarders pretending to be businessmen within the village, mercenary groups hijacking trade caravans, unscrupulous vendors engaged in charlatanry...\nMoreover, after seeing people who came from abroad, the residents of Aaru Village gradually began to yearn for life outside. Gradually, people tried to go out to make a living, and fewer and fewer young people were willing to stay in the village.\nThe former Guardians had long been dissatisfied with Candace, who, as they saw it, had \"abandoned\" their traditions. Seeing that the village was in such a situation, they again held a meeting and prepared to challenge her.\n\"What we Guardians must do is maintain order in the village!\"\n\"Candace! What you have done will only cost this village its peace!\"\n\"Candace! Go and fulfill your duties now!\"\nAs the war of words swayed back and forth, the lance-wielding female warrior suddenly shot up to her full height.\n\"That's enough!\"\n\"If you only wish to protect the 'past' of this village, then do it yourself! Whether you wish to just remain in your homes or leave Aaru Village, that is up to you!\"\n\"I will not let the people of Aaru Village be bound by the past forever.\"\n\"If you can't move forward, then it's up to me to protect our future!\"\nThe old Guardians were intimidated by her, her young, fiery eyes making it impossible for them to come forward and question her further.\nBurning with rare anger, Candace hefted her long spear and stormed out of the dispute-ridden hut.\nAnd, as if in response to her convictions, a shining \"jewel\" had appeared at the tip of that lance, though she knew not when it had done so.\nThe eyes of the gods had found her, and they had given her their approval.\nA \"Vision\" is also a resolute heart — and no finer ornament than it may be found anywhere."

            "Character Details\tThroughout its long history, Liyue has never had a lack of rumors and myths regarding all manner of evil spirits and demons. And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has to do something about them.\nChongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists, and has possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his pure-yang spirit. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to scatter evil spirits. \nHowever, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never come face-to-face with a single ghost or demon.\nChongyun believes in his heart that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has... is just not orthodox.\nTherefore, he has dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his unique physical condition.\nYet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his path to self-realization?",
            "Character Story 1\tWhen Chongyun first ventured out as an exorcist, there had been much talk of an evil spirit lurking inside Liyue Harbor.\nThe victim of these hauntings was a woman from a family with a high enough stature to even have a word or two with the Liyue Qixing.\nFrom a time she knew not when, her sleep began to be harassed by sounds that kept her awake, but every time she tried to follow the sound, it would suddenly shift behind her, and begin ringing again in her ears.\nThis shock caused her unspeakable distress, and she even lost weight for loss of appetite.\nHer wealth was enough to hire the best exorcists from all over, but no matter what they tried, they had to retreat empty-handed. And not only did the noises persist, they even grew in boldness.\nIt was then, just when she had given up all hope, that Chongyun walked through her door.\n\"I apologize for coming just now, it has been far too sunny lately... I heard that this place houses a very stubborn ghost. Please, leave it to me.\"\nThen Chongyun brought a chair over, and sat upon it in the middle of the house for a time.\nThat night, the strange sounds were no more.\nThe wealthy woman finally had a good night's sleep, and she came running to Chongyun the next morning with an overabundance of gold and jewelry as a reward.\nBut Chongyun, as was his wont, only accepted his usual fee of a few hundred Mora without an ounce of emotion on his face.\nEver since that incident, Chongyun has found that his reputation precedes him for miles around. He has become beloved in Liyue for his \"style and character,\" and indeed scholars have given him this appellation: \"a heart of clear water, and a face of ice.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tHowever, calling his mannerisms and style \"frosty\" couldn't be farther from the truth.\nDue to the abundance of yang energy in his constitution, he is constantly troubled by increased body temperature and sudden urges or impulses.\nHe has tried everything to alleviate the issues both physically and psychologically.\nHis methods include not drinking hot water, not eating hot or spicy food, wearing light clothes, not getting into arguments, keeping himself from being angered, staying indoors on sweltering days, and always bringing a parasol when on the job.\nIn short, he attempted to stay away from everything that might aggravate his condition.\nDespite all this, his yang energy did not subside a whit.\nA little depressed, Chongyun began to wrestle with his own body. When he heard about an evil spirit in Dragonspine, he made for the peak wearing only a shirt.\nThough it was hard enough to keep himself warm, he still felt this insufficient. Digging a hole in a frozen lake, he jumped in and soaked in the icy water while waiting for the evil spirit to show itself.\nAfter staying in the lake for half a day, he finally caught a glimpse of his target.\nHowever, after pursuing it down to the mountainside, he discovered it was only a snow rabbit that had been frightened off by his flying swords and floating charms.\nThe fever that he ran afterward lasted far longer than it would in a normal person.",
            "Character Story 3\tChongyun's pure-yang spirit is not only a huge obstacle in his path as an exorcist, but a constant daily hassle.\nHe must be extra careful to stay away from \"heaty\" things, to which he is very sensitive, or risk his yang energy and emotions going out of control.\nChongyun's clan once held a celebration party at Wanmin Restaurant. And though he waited until all the dishes had gone cold, he did not expect the tender rice balls to be stuffed with Jueyun Chili.\nAfter but a single bite... Chongyun had no recollection of what happened next.\nHowever, according to the victim, chef Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant, many unforgettable things happened.\nChongyun first jumped onto the reception desk and shouted, \"Everything's on me tonight!\" — never mind that he did not actually have any money on him.\nHe then began to chat with customers at other tables as if they were old pals, bragging to them of how incredible his clan's exorcist arts were, never forgetting to taste other people's dishes on the tables before he left.\nLastly, he claimed to have sensed an evil spirit in Wanmin Restaurant. This he did not find, but he did slap a charm on Xiangling's forehead and chase her around with his sword.\nAfterwards, Chongyun scrimped and saved for an entire month to pay Wanmin Restaurant back for the mess and any damages he might have caused; he also gave Xiangling an evil-warding talisman that he carved by hand.\nBut Xiangling, for her part, didn't mind Chongyun's \"transgressions\" at all. Instead, she felt that the crazy Chongyun was the real Chongyun, without any personal walls up.",
            "Character Story 4\tChongyun has had the privilege of meeting a true friend in his long journey as an exorcist: Xingqiu.\nIn contrast to the hard-working Chongyun, Xingqiu was naturally gifted, and had a more flexible way of looking at problems.\nAfter learning about Chongyun's troubles, Xingqiu came up with a possible solution.\n\"If you can't reduce the effects of your yang energy, what if you sought out an evil spirit that is immune to it?\"\nThis was a eureka moment for Chongyun. Since then, Chongyun has no longer sought to alleviate his condition. Instead, he now tries to get Xingqiu to come with him to find such a spirit.\n\"What? Sightings of the legendary Aoyin near the Sea of Clouds? Leave it to me!\"\n\"The old house at Feiyun Slope has been taken over by an evil spirit? My bad. I'll attend to it right away.\"\n\"A master exorcist is staying over at Wangshu Inn? I could learn a lot from him... Hmm, better go with a gift.\"\nXingqiu usually just makes these \"leads\" up as he goes, and thanks to his \"advice,\" Chongyun often comes back empty-handed, blaming his bad luck.\n\"I tried my best to look for it, and even spent quite a sum purchasing more intelligence on that evil spirit — but I wound up missing it by a hair anyway,\" Chongyun says, abashed.\nIf Xingqiu has time to spare when such an occasion arises, he will encourage Chongyun, treat him to some new cold dishes he has found and then set off to get Chongyun's swindled money back.\nA warm and reliable companion, indeed! — So Chongyun thinks at such moments. Who could he possibly trust, if not his fine friend Xingqiu?",
            "Character Story 5\tIn truth, Chongyun wishes that he could fit in more, but he is often forced to reject the invitations of others on account of his need to control his abundance of yang energy.\nOf these practices, he finds one particularly incomprehensible: hot springs.\nBathing and \"relaxing\" in steaming-hot water? Even the sound of that scares him a hundred times more than freezing in a lake on Dragonspine.\nHowever, he has also heard everyone sing yearning praises of these hot springs, praising their comfort, and asserting that they become more so the hotter they are, and that one is filled with energy for a whole week afterward.\nChongyun still doesn't know if this is true or if people are just teasing him.\nAnd he would have dared to try it out, if not for the ever-present problem of his pure-yang spirit.\nXingqiu once asked him this:\n\"If you were able to master your yang energy and rid the world of all evil spirits someday...what would you do after that?\"\nThis seemingly off-the-cuff remark troubled Chongyun deeply.\nPerhaps he had indeed missed out on a lot in life on account of his condition.\nBut he doesn't regret spending time. If one way of living doesn't work, he just needs to find himself another — and in any case, he already has his answer.\nIf that day comes, well, he'll go to the hot springs then.",
            "Field Guide to Demons and Beasts\tThe tomes that Chongyun's family has passed down from generation to generation detail every evil spirit they have ever subdued.\nFrom little critters to the monstrous demons found in tall tales of horror, their varieties are almost dazzling.\nIt was one such terrifying story that inspired Chongyun's vow to rid the world of evil spirits.\nBut as far as he is concerned, inheriting these books has... also proved inconvenient.\nOther than textual descriptions, the books also contain illustrations of said evil spirits that carefully detail their unique characteristics — even if the artist may not have been the greatest talent.\nBut Chongyun has never seen an evil spirit in his life. Unwilling to break with this artistic tradition, he was at a loss.\nUltimately, he would attempt to use his imagination to draw some suitably strange images.\n—Thus did the Field Guide to Demons and Beasts grow ever more exotic. Best not to think too deeply about that seven-winged, five-legged chicken-beast or that half-fish, half-hilichurl demon.",
            "Vision\t\"Those other exorcists at least have the courtesy to wave their swords or tack on some talismans. You just sat here for a while, and now you say you're done, and that I should pay you? Who are you trying to fool?\"\nChongyun faced a great deal of suspicion when he first took up the role of an exorcist.\nHe immediately faced one big hurdle: it was a lot easier to prove that \"evil spirits are present\" than not.\nOf course he would seem a charlatan even compared to \"exorcists\" who just went through the motions.\nWith all the ability in the world but no place to use it, looked on with suspicion, and needing to suppress any passionate impulses...\nThose who eventually apologized to him were also few.\nBut even so, Chongyun would not go with the flow, and use some fancy act to cover for his real method of conducting exorcism.\nEven with his unique composition posing countless obstacles for him, Chongyun has never once considered giving up.\nOne day, he will become the greatest exorcist in Liyue, control his abundance of yang energy, and rid the world of evil spirits.\nPerhaps it was this resolve that earned him the gods' favor — that said, the Vision granted to Chongyun was one of \"Cryo\" rather than \"Pyro.\"\nAs to which of his goals it was that the Vision responded to, that is also a mystery."

            "About Us: New Friends\tI used to think that I'd never make a single friend in my whole life, but things changed when I went to Mondstadt... Then after that, I met Master in Sumeru. Now I've met you, too. All in all, I think I've been really lucky.",
            "About the Vision\tI never thought there'd come a day where I get my own Vision. In the past, I used to think that the gods only cared about people who were born popular... Um, but I was in a bad place back then. Sorry.",
            "Something to Share: Skill Names\tMaster is always reminding me that practice makes perfect, so I sometimes try reading some light novels to improve my reading ability... Because they're at least easier to read than Master's essays. But recently, I was reading this book where the main character has loads of different skills.

When I was a kid, there were so many times when I just wanted to scream out to the gods and ask them why, why did I have to go through so much pain...? *sigh* But, for all I know, maybe the gods feel just as helpless about everything they have to endure as I did back then.",

It's just that... whenever I'm reminded of the sealing process just before leaving Mondstadt... ooh... the back of my neck starts hurting again...",
            "About Kaveh\tThe General Mahamatra once brought him to our place for a meal.

So much time has gone by — I bet she's even more cool and confident than ever these days! Who knows if I'll ever be able to match her.",

She's always saying that I'm a hardworking student and eager to learn, but that's because I have to be! I'm a slow learner, so I have to put in the extra effort. Oh, there was a time when I accidentally saw her research journal — only for a second, though. It was all written in old script, and I couldn't even make out half of it... Definitely the scariest book in Teyvat!",

After so long in that place, I couldn't help but start to wonder, what have I done wrong to deserve this? Why won't anyone come to rescue me? Gradually, I went from hating just the Fatui to hating everyone in the world. Thinking about it now... it was quite childish.",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\t\"Helpful,\" \"bright and sunny,\" \"friendly and passionate\"... Just ask around Gandharva Ville, and you'll hear this Trainee Forest Ranger praised to the skies in such terms.\nAs long as her body allows, no matter how busy school gets, Collei will never slack off when it comes to her forest patrol work, and is always willing to lend a warm helping hand to whoever is in trouble, regardless of what walk of life they are from.\nNevertheless, even as enthusiastic and positive as she is, there seems to be a past and things on her mind that she is not yet ready to reveal to others.\nIf in the woods where she often patrols, you should chance upon a tree hollow full of strange notes, or hear someone whispering nearby...\nNo matter what you witnessed or overheard, please kindly take a detour and consider it a silly prank — one played by an Aranara, perhaps.\nAfter all, there are some things that only a tree hollow can know — for now, anyway.",
            "Character Story 1\tIf words are the vehicles of wisdom, being literate is undoubtedly the starting point of the pursuit of knowledge. Collei, however, seems to have only barely reached the foot of the mountain of knowledge.\nWhen she first arrived in Gandharva Ville, even the outspoken Tighnari showed obvious hesitation, making repeated inquiries with the General Mahamatra if she had walked through the wrong door, since he had yet to make any plans to teach preschool level courses.\nStill, after several twists and turns, Collei did finally become a trainee. To facilitate her learning of words, Tighnari gathered a wide assortment of books and documents, in the hope that Collei would soon master enough words through extensive reading.\nApart from the literacy encyclopedias for children and the mandatory-reading academic papers that made her head swell, Collei can most often be found reading fairy tale picture books from Mondstadt.\nThe logic is simple: those books tend to have fewer words and more pictures. Even if you do not know the words, chances are that you can still guess their meaning by looking at the illustrations.\nHowever, reading only children's books hardly sufficed to keep up with her curriculum. Once she had picked up slightly more words, she immediately started to look for new extracurricular reading materials.\nAccording to some travelers who had passed through Avidya Forest, there was a type of book in Inazuma known as the \"light novel,\" which was easier to read than academic papers, and with fewer illustrations than picture books. To Collei, that sounded like the exact type of book she needed.\nMore importantly, the plots of these \"light novels\" were often so incredibly riveting that as soon as they got a copy, many readers just had to finish reading it in one go, even if they had to stay up all night.\nThat definitely sounded tempting to Collei, since she had to force herself, more often than not, to stay awake long enough to finish her readings.\nOne day after her forest patrol, Collei excitedly ran back to her dormitory with the newest volume of \"Onibudou.\" She was so ready to pull an all-nighter reading the light novel — and as it turned out, she indeed stayed awake that night.\n\"My sealed power!\" \"The lonesome avenger!\" \"You'd be wise to stay away from me!\" \"I shall never witness the grace of the gods!\"...\n—Covering her head with the quilt, Collei tossed and turned upon her mattress the entire night. Even as the dawn broke, she had not yet torn her mind away from these words.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere is a saying in Teyvat that has obscure origins and is often used by people who are feeling extremely ashamed or embarrassed:\n\"I just wanted the tree to open up and swallow me.\"\nCollei was pacing in the woods while murmuring the sentence, which she had just learned from a book.\nBefore she returned to Sumeru, she had promised a dear friend that she would become an excellent doctor with exceptional medical skills so as to save people like her who were in constant agony, both physically and mentally.\nHowever, it takes only a passing passion to make a wish, and yet it requires years of painstaking training to realize it. In the examination that had just concluded, Collei had hit the barrier between reality and expectations once more.\n\"Ugh... How am I supposed to tell Amber about this...\"\nPlus, she would have to ask her master to write the letter for her. Things like doing poorly on the test and wanting to have someone to talk to were not things she could easily speak out in front of her master, either.\nIt just so happened that a tree hollow, roughly the size of a person, appeared along her patrol route, as if some god had overheard her mumblings.\n\"Wait, wait... Talking to Aranara about my problems... I mean, I've read about it in the books, but they were children's books! I'm sure I've outgrown that... But now that there's no one around...\"\nBefore she knew it, she was already crouching in said hollow.\nThe darkness turned into a solid fortress, isolating Collei from all kinds of pressure.\nCollei, being an introvert by nature, found it difficult to present herself impeccably. No matter how hard she strove to be as outgoing and sunny as Amber, she could never manage to ignore her weariness and loneliness.\nThus did Collei vent her distress to that hollow, emptying herself of all the negativity she had accumulated after getting back to Sumeru.\n\"Did Collei go on patrol in that area again?\"\nA few days later, Tighnari checked on Collei's recent forest patrol routes, which she had been taking all too frequently, before looking at her test papers, which featured remarkably higher scores. He could not help but think to himself:\n\"Did she find a way to improve her grades in the forest? Well, that's not bad either way. Alright, I'll save that patrol route for her and leave her be for the time being. I'll have other Rangers take the other routes.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tShould written tests be left out, Collei actually does well on her exams, especially when it comes to \"surviving in the wilderness.\"\nThe jungles of Sumeru suffer no shortage of poisonous creatures and dangerous beasts, while unexpected emergencies lurk around every corner. Therefore, a competent Forest Ranger must be a thoroughly-prepared one.\nAnd Collei really exceeds in this regard. She may not be as literate as her peers, which hinders her performance in all the written tests. Yet, she is nothing if not practical and creative.\nWrapping thorny vines around her boots to increase traction, rubbing the toxic sap of poisonous mushrooms onto hunting traps to promote efficiency...\nSuch ideas have ensured that she can travel in and out of the jungle safely, successfully extracting those unfortunate enough to become lost in the woods, accidentally ingest poison, or get hit by a running beast.\nThose who have been rescued by Collei are, one and all, amazed by her unique but reliable survival skills — not to mention how they are all moved by her genuine kindness and enthusiasm.\nBe it surrounded by grave dangers, or lacking food and supplies, even if the rescued traveler turns hysterical, she embraces every circumstance with the warmth of the sun.\nShe cares little for scars, and hunger concerns her not. She just wants to offer help to whoever is in need.\nThe only thing about her that is considered unacceptable by many is the recipes she utilizes during times of crisis: as long as they can replenish her energy, she will even gladly swallow fireflies without hesitation — the crushed pits of Zaytun Peaches are even less of an obstacle.\nWhen people meet her, they simply cannot help but wonder about this young trainee's past.\n—What sort of experiences could make such a seemingly innocent girl see the wilderness as her home?",
            "Character Story 4\tBefore returning to Sumeru, Collei had wandered for a long time.\nThe decisive difference between wandering and traveling, of course, lies in that the former bears no designated destination.\nHer wandering started from those charred ruins, or perhaps earlier, when she was afflicted with that disease, and it was long destined to be a never-ending nightmare extending into nothing but total darkness.\nMost of the companions with whom she had fled from the ruins either lost their way in the endless waves of sandstorms, or corroded to death by divine remains.\nSick and cursed, they had nowhere to stay, thus turning to uninhabited jungles and wildernesses.\nMother Nature is both merciful and cruel. She would never reject them because of their illness, nor would she offer whatever they need even if they cried out for it.\nAs more and more of her companions could walk no further, the lessons they left behind helped the rest become better at surviving in the most desperate situations.\nAnd when Collei's last companion could no longer continue, she learned yet another lesson: never to reach out to anyone again.\nAt that time, the two of them had their backs against the cliff, utterly exhausted. Yet, they could still hear the beast roaring from not too far off.\nPerhaps it was because of the narrow passage, if not for other reasons, but her only remaining companion bumped into her, sending her careening off the cliff.\nFortunately, Collei managed to grab a tiny twig in her panic, before stretching out her other hand and shouting for help.\nHowever, that companion merely glanced at her with a complicated look before escaping alone without hesitation.\nShe did not get far, the beast's howls outpacing her fleeing steps like a raging wind. The beast's pure predatory instinct caused it to overlook the shivering Collei, who was barely hanging onto the cliff.\nCollei quietly withdrew her hand and held on tightly to the branch that might break at any moment, until all the sounds above her head died down.\nThe roar of the beast and the screams of that companion had all disappeared.\nShe could not hate that companion. If she were in that person's shoes, she could not guarantee that she would have made a different choice.\nAt that moment, there was only one thought remaining in Collei's mind.\nBe it to offer help or to ask for it—\n\"I will never reach out to anyone again.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tCollei once again touched someone's hand during a certain year's Ludi Harpastum in Mondstadt.\nThe city was elaborately decorated with lights and lanterns. The streets were jam-packed with people. The sky was getting darker, and the stage was in full swing.\nA girl in flaming red just grabbed her hand, took her out of that cramped wooden box, and squeezed into the crowd.\nPeople gathered around, cheering and applauding the contestants who were playing hoops or with slingshots.\nCollei could not relate to them. No matter how well they could play these most childish games, what use were they in hunting game out in the wild?\nYet, the girl with her was extremely passionate about these little games. She would cheer and whoop at every victory, and hand out the prizes she won to the children.\nCollei was even more baffled. If not for the rewards, why would anyone participate in these activities? Was there really any fun in them?\nSo she sneaked to a corner and picked up a slingshot to try her hand at it — in the end, one of the more than ten shots she fired eventually hit the edge of the target.\n\"Yay! I hit it!\" Collei turned her head excitedly. \"Hey! Did you see...\"\nIt was only then that she realized that she had been there for quite a long time and the girl in red had already left.\nIn the days that followed, Collei had been practicing day in and day out. Gradually, she became more than familiar with the sounds of drawing a bowstring and throwing darts. She practiced for a long time, until she would seldom miss a shot out of ten.\nEvery time she pulled the bowstring back, Collei remembered the excitement of hitting the target for the first time on that night.\nAnd that when the girl grabbed her hand and ran towards the crowd, her palm was as warm as the sun.",
            "Cuilein-Anbar\tTo grow up is to best one's immature past self.\nCollei often helps the children in Gandharva Ville mend toys, and her Forest Rangers colleagues also occasionally ask her to help patch their clothes when they get torn up by branches.\nThat said, Collei was by no means born a seamstress. As a matter of fact, her first attempt at sewing was nothing short of a disaster.\nIt was when Collei was about to leave Mondstadt. Right before she left, she handed a piece of repaired old clothes to Lisa, hoping that she could return it to its original owner, Amber, on her behalf.\nThe piece was indeed repaired, but also covered in stitches so twisted that one could potentially mistake them for earthworms. In all likelihood, it was no longer possible for its owner to ever wear it out again.\nShe was afraid that Lisa would laugh at her or criticize her.\nTo her surprise, Lisa just gently took Collei's hands, hidden as they had been behind her back, and carefully bandaged the injuries.\nShe was not even slightly surprised by all the injuries, deep or shallow, on Collei's fingertips. She just casually commented, \"Why, it almost looks as if someone's been bouncing Wolfhooks across their hands all night, as if they were balls.\"\n\"Don't be this impatient with your studies in Sumeru, little Collei,\" Lisa said with a smile. \"There's always a first time for everything, and learning to overcome the difficulties you encountered during that first time is where the meaning of growing up lies.\"\nCollei instantly blushed. She had not quite learned how to accept the kindness of others back then.\nBut she was just a child, and children grow up.\nThe desperate child would grow up and discover hope once again. A child who could not use a slingshot at all gradually learned how to aim.\nThat child who was once constantly injured by a needle has also slowly grown up to be an ingenious role model in the eyes of other children.\nIn Gandharva Ville, children gather around Collei, chittering with envy and excitement.\n\"You're so skillful! What a pretty cat!\" \"Collei, does it have a name?\"\nCollei, for once, felt so proud of herself. She held up the exquisite cat doll, all fine stitches and perfect needlework.\n\"This is — Cuilein-Anbar!\"",
            "Vision\tThe rain was pouring. A surge of rock, earth, and debris had blocked Collei's way back.\nCollei lit a bonfire by the cliff, trying to warm the shivering girl next to her.\nThis river valley would require a full day's journey from the woodlands that were the domain of her usual patrols. If she were here all by herself, it would not be entirely impossible to get back in this rain.\nBut now that she had a child with her, wracked by cold and hunger after being lost in the woods for a long time, she had to wait.\nThe girl looked pale, her forehead boiled, and she kept murmuring her mother's name.\nCollei still remembered the girl's mother, who had been anxiously and desperately seeking help in Gandharva Ville — she recalled the look on her face, the look of one who wished that she was in suffering instead of her daughter. Collei knew that look.\nThe family had been traveling with a caravan to cross the river valley. As they were camping and resting, her playful daughter had run off, straying into the deep forest. As soon as the caravan noticed that the child was missing, they tried their best searching for her, but it was all in vain.\nIn desperation, the mother had to return to Gandharva Ville to look for help.\nRecently, Tighnari had been attending meetings in the city with other Forest Rangers, and the situation before her was critical — Collei could not wait for any of them to return. Nor could she rely on the search and rescue dogs during such heavy rain.\nSo she immediately grabbed her pack, bow, and arrows, before diving into the forest alone.\nAt that moment, the occasional low growl against the sound of thunder and rain told her that there were beasts approaching.\nCollei could not help but recall some disturbing experiences from her past. Old memories came flooding back, the memories she least wanted to face.\nBut the rain would pass, and after receiving the news, Tighnari rushed over without taking any breaks.\nTraces of fighting could be found all the way along the cliff. Several beasts lay fallen in the distance, while Collei and the girl slept peacefully on each other's shoulders.\nTighnari's heart seized up in his chest. He was well aware that Collei was not capable of doing all this — unless she had wielded power that should not be unleashed.\nIt was like drinking poison to quench thirst, and it would surely aggravate Collei's condition. He must contact the General Mahamatra right away...\nTighnari's footsteps awakened Collei. She hurriedly gestured to ask her master to quiet down so as not to wake the girl next to her.\nTighnari checked upon her worriedly, \"Collei... Did you...\"\nCollei shook her head. She raised a hand and released the fist that had been clenched all night.\n\"Master, I've become stronger! I won't let anyone's efforts go to waste — from now on, I'll protect everyone.\"\nIt was a Vision, silently glowing in her hand."

            "Character Details\tAs the leader of all matra, General Mahamatra Cyno is well known to everyone in the Akademiya.\nHis duties are to arrest those who violate the Akademiya's rules and regulations, terminate illegal studies, and uphold discipline of the Akademiya. Nevertheless, researchers feel that this General Mahamatra does nothing but undermine academic progress and prohibit scientific research. Some even claim that he is \"cutting off the path to knowledge\" and can be seen as a dire threat to any researcher eager to seek knowledge...\nOver time, researchers have come to shrink away from Cyno in silence whenever they so much as see him, wanting to have nothing to do with him.\nBut the General Mahamatra is hardly bothered by such things.\nIf this exaggerated public image can really deter some researchers, that will in no way be an inconvenience for his work.\nPlus, in the words of that Forest Watcher friend of his,\n\"The research conducted by most researchers is nowhere significant enough to result in a talk with a matra.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tWisdom can bring enlightenment to scholars, but can also lead to utter arrogance.\nIn the history of the Akademiya, many researchers have used their \"wisdom\" to commit crimes.\nFor example, in order to test the limit of the Specters' body inflation, one Amurta researcher adopted an illegal catalyst and created a mega-sized Specter, which later exploded during the experiment and leveled the entire research center. Then, there was a researcher from Spantamad who had aimed to test a Ruin Guard's ability to cultivate fields, but lost control of the modified machine, resulting in the ruin of many farmlands and grave injuries for several farmers. There have also been numerous criminal cases concerning academic fraud and the abuse of intelligence for personal gain...\nSuch researchers, who do not abide by the law and pose dangers to others, will all be pursued and judged by the matra led by Cyno.\nWhen they stand before the matra, these researchers will almost always spare no effort to justify themselves. Their reasons have included but are not limited to suddenly cut funds, the Akademiya's favoritism towards other researchers, the results of their work being stolen... Some may even accuse the matra of stopping them from completing their research out of jealousy of their talents.\nCyno's response to such sophistry is always to stay silent and press forward in subduing all those garrulous criminals and sending them to trial.\nThose who violate the rules can always come up with a million excuses. However, only one ending awaits them.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe name of the General Mahamatra has traveled well beyond the Akademiya's walls.\nAccording to a Forest Watcher in the Avidya Forest, he once caught a glimpse of this General Mahamatra quietly traveling through the woods in the middle of the night. A person living on the outskirts of Apam Woods can still clearly remember how a white-haired teenager asked them for a bowl of water, before venturing deep into the forest alone with just a traveling pack on his back. Adventurers resting in Sobek Oasis claim to have given directions to Cyno, though the area he was heading to had been packed with monsters. Even the proudest mercenaries and Treasure Hoarders in the Great Red Sand dare not make things difficult for the General Mahamatra, having learned this lesson well from the example of a mercenary group that was annihilated in the desert for sheltering wanted researchers.\nHowever, for those criminals who have fallen into the hands of Cyno, their reverence for the General Mahamatra usually comes from another aspect of his character.\nWhen escaping from the Akademiya, criminals tend to flee in an extreme panic, and can sometimes stray into perilous places. Yet, instead of letting them suffer the consequences, Cyno will come to their rescue without hesitation, just so that he can bring them back to the Akademiya to face their proper punishment.\nOnce, a criminal who had crossed the Great Red Sand with Cyno asked him about the point of doing all this. Cyno replied,\n\"Only the law can judge you, and my role here is to bring you to face the scales.\"\nAfter being released from prison, the researcher, who had been a Vahumana graduate, turned their adventures returning to the Akademiya into a novel titled \"The Goon,\" which remains a bestseller in the Akademiya. The researcher was even invited by Vahumana to give a lecture, during which they went into great detail about the portrayal of \"justice\" in the book.\nIf you ask Cyno, however, he would say that certain parts of the book were heavily exaggerated. In truth, they did not encounter any monsters created by the descendants of King Deshret, nor did they stray into a living labyrinth at the bottom of the desert or survive a sandstorm in the folds of a humongous sandworm.\nNevertheless, Cyno did appreciate the candidness with which the author described their own crimes, and would like to remind them to not commit such crimes ever again.",
            "Character Story 3\tIn the Akademiya, the mere mention of the matra's office can make any researcher's heart seize up.\nApart from the renowned \"evil deeds\" of the matra, what disturbs them even more is how creepy, dry laughter can be heard from the office whenever Cyno walks in...\nResearchers firmly believe that this must be the matra's way of expressing smug satisfaction at the sight of Cyno passing judgment on some hapless researcher.\nBut only the matra know that the laughter is a response to Cyno's unique sense of humor.\n\"I once worked on a case where the researcher involved was under great pressure because his paper had been rejected multiple times at the review stage. He eventually rammed it through by successfully bribing the members of his review committee. However, the data in that paper was so wrong that it didn't even take long to be exposed as academic fraud. When I went to arrest this researcher, he asked me 'what have I done wrong?'...\"\nAfter a pause, Cyno continued,\n\"I answered, 'Your paper.'\"\nSeeing the matra all sit there in silence, Cyno seemed to be worried that they did not get the joke, so he went on to explain it with a serious expression,\n\"You see, the interesting part of this story lies in how, when he asked me what he had done wrong, he expected me to say that his fault lay with his bribing of the committee due to academic pressure, yet I told him that his error was in not reaching the correct conclusions in his paper. The clever part about this joke is that I changed the subject that was being discussed...\"\nAfter he finished explaining, the matra all exchanged looks before letting out a few dry, strangled laughs in concert...\nThe awkward laughter lent a strange sense of human warmth then to the often somber and solemn matra office.\nHowever, to prevent such an awkward situation from ever happening again, the matra gradually came to a consensus that after Cyno finishes telling a joke, everyone in the room must force out a laugh or two in response so that he will not start explaining it.\nOn the other hand, any matra who attempts to imitate Cyno's style will be harshly punished by the others through extreme means such as confiscating their canteen meal tickets.\nAfter all, one Cyno is enough for the whole division.",
            "Character Story 4\tCyno has always believed that the matra are not the enemies of those who seek knowledge.\nCyrus, a scholar who tutored Cyno before, once told him that without the Akademiya's laws, \"wisdom\" will soon turn into \"calamity.\"\nThese floating scraps of out-of-control \"wisdom\" are like bait on a sea of ignorance, luring innocent knowledge seekers into the abyss.\nThey will make researchers far too arrogant and reckless, to the point where they may even attempt to tamper with life and death due to their lack of respect for human life. Eventually, they shall cause irreparable damage to the world.\nThe sages keep introducing new rules and regulations precisely to ensure that the knowledge seekers of the Akademiya will not be misled and go astray because of such bait.\nThe matra who hunt down those who violate the law and judge them according to those same laws are in fact the \"guardians\" of all those who seek knowledge in the Akademiya.\nHowever, in the eyes of researchers, they are but a bunch of \"demolishers\" who constantly, violently cut off their paths to knowledge.\n\"Dumb humanoid Fungi,\" \"Mr. You-Can't-Do-This,\" \"Paper Shredders\"... These are all nicknames they have come up with for the matra.\nAmong them, the most notorious one is \"the Akademiya's Sumpter Beasts,\" a name coined by a Haravatat researcher.\nWhen they first heard of this nickname, most of the matra were rather enraged, reckoning that the researchers thought too little of their hard work.\nOn the contrary, Cyno noted that he actually fancied it quite a bit.\n\"We matra are indeed Sumpter Beasts who walk the Akademiya's halls, carrying the rules and regulations on our backs.\"\n\"When exercising our rights, each of us must always keep that weight in mind.\"\nAfter pondering the matter for a while, this General Mahamatra added,\n\"Plus, we could stand to be more like Sumpter Beasts in avoiding pointless arguments and focusing on, ahem, getting to our desired destination.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tWhen the Akademiya was first established, its researchers wielded their boundless imagination and innovation to the fullest with the abundant resources available at their beck and call.\nThey had reshaped terrain, controlled the weather, recreated ancient relics... But when the knowledge of the earth could no longer satisfy their insatiable curiosity, some researchers turned their focus to the starry skies, whereas some others attempted to tamper with life and death.\nHowever, these kinds of knowledge were not things they should or could have touched upon.\nTo prevent researchers from being devastated by their own knowledge, the sages laid out six cardinal sins.\nThey held that all the crimes in this world derive from these six sins.\nThe first is to interfere with human evolution;\nThe second is to tamper with life and death;\nThe third is to delve beyond the universe;\nThe fourth is to investigate the origin of words;\nThe fifth is to revere gods without acts of devotion;\nThe sixth is to attempt the forbidden and fear none.\nSince then, the sages have been introducing new rules and regulations according to these six deadly sins while amending and revising old ones. The matra enforce the laws, and the researchers perform their roles accordingly as well.\nIn this way, everything in the Akademiya functions in a desirable manner, and the Akademiya and its researchers have been marching forward with thriving clarity of wisdom ever since.\nAs time has passed, the six ancient sins seem to have been forgotten by most, and ambitious people have been on the move since...\nHowever, for Cyno, the current General Mahamatra, what he ought to do has not changed.\nHe will, according to the six ancient deadly sins, justly judge all the lawbreakers.\nEven sages shall not be exempt.",
            "Cyno's Genius Invokation TCG Deck Box\tThis deck box, which contains Cyno's Genius Invokation TCG deck, is his favorite physical possession.\nThe exterior of this deck box is wrapped with multiple layers of high-quality leather, and every seam has been carefully handled. As long as the rope fixed on the leather remains tightly tied, the entire deck box will be completely sealed, and not even a drop of water can get through. The interior is padded with silk, which can minimize the bending of card corners. According to the shop owner, the silk used was all imported from Liyue and made from top-quality Silk Flowers. This deck box even comes with a tough leather strap, so the buyer can easily affix the box to any part of their body. The surface of the deck box is even engraved with the Genius Invokation TCG emblem and the name of one who purchased it.\nCyno has put his strongest deck in this box. He believes that as long as he gets to duel with this deck, he will be nothing short of invincible.\nOf course, the next thing to do is to find a couple players who are willing to play against him.\nHmm... Would that Forest Watcher be available at the moment?",
            "Vision\tWhen it comes to how Cyno got his Vision, many versions of the story can be found circulating in the Akademiya.\nSome say that he was once instructed to arrest a researcher who had been studying methods of making counterfeit Visions. The researcher had previously bought a masterless Vision for research, which then became Cyno's Vision. Some believe that Cyno is actually a descendant of King Deshret. They say that he grew up in a temple located in the Great Red Sand and was raised by a nameless Hermanubis priest who cultivated Cyno's will and strength before, when he was ready, bestowing upon him a Vision and requiring him to cross the desert all by himself to arrive at the Akademiya and enact Hermanubis' will. Of course, according to some conspiracy theories, Cyno's Vision is closely connected with certain forbidden technologies hidden within the Akademiya. Otherwise, how could this member of the desert ilk earn a spot in the Akademiya?\nNo one dares to check any of the stories' authenticity with Cyno in person, and Cyno himself cannot be bothered to waste energy on these ridiculous rumors.\nThe truth is that the way he obtained his Vision was rather simple.\nIt was the day before he was about to become the new General Mahamatra. As per usual, after finishing his work as a matra, Cyno went to the library to read books relating to the Akademiya's rules and regulations. He can still well remember that the book he was reading that day mainly talked about the six cardinal sins that the sages had decided on, which they held to be the origins of all crimes and thus served as the foundation for all the modern rules and regulations of the Akademiya. While he was reading the chapter on \"to attempt the forbidden and fear none,\" he failed to fathom some chunks of the content depicted in the book, so he closed his eyes and ruminated. The moment he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a Vision, laid nicely on the page.\nCyno looked at the Vision and fell into contemplation. He first confirmed that there was no existing rule that prohibited someone from being granted a Vision. Then he went over several academic cases with Visions involved and ensured that this Vision was not some malicious trap. He went on to ponder the challenges he might encounter after becoming the General Mahamatra and how this Vision might help in these future trials... After carefully weighing up the pros and cons, Cyno finally accepted this gift from the gods earnestly.\nBy then, the morning light was already shining through the windows. Cyno left the library with the Vision and his as-yet-unfinished read in hand before heading over to the location where he was to be inaugurated as the General Mahamatra.\nIf all went well, in half an hour, he would become the Akademiya's new General Mahamatra.\nHe was about to be entrusted with the sacred power to judge those who had erred, and this Vision would ensure that this sacred privilege could be exercised as intended."

            "Character Details\tThe term \"Eremites\" does not reference a specific group or organization, but all those who are born of the desert and ply a trade using their martial prowess, operating as mercenaries.\nFrail is humanity in such a desolate profession. To survive, those who walk the path of a mercenary will naturally come together, forming loose bands of mercenaries.\nThough the Eremites are many, few among them will be remembered as legends, with most bound to be as evanescent as sand in the wind. Yet there are exceptions who, like Dehya, may linger in the annals of history.\nThe \"Flame-Mane\" Dehya is fierce and brave, the lion her moniker invokes an analogy for her might. The nickname itself, meanwhile, denotes her passionate nature.\nShould you be planning to hire a mercenary to serve as a bodyguard, Dehya stands as a prime choice. Procuring her service runs an expensive premium, but her abilities make that a worthy expenditure indeed.\nCompared to those overconfident fools hawking their talents as hired blades on the street and novices capable of little more than brute force, Dehya is a conscientious professional.\nWith all this said, those who wish to procure her services should make haste, for there is a long line of other potential clients that have need of the Flame-Mane, and the opportunity, just as grains in the desert, will slip away before long.",
            "Character Story 1\tAll desertfolk, including Dehya, learn to master and comprehend the sands.\nHere, where the blue of the sky is boundless, where the gold-paved waves of the sands bleed into the cleft of the horizon, it is easy to feel how small one truly is.\nEven those familiar with the sights and scenes of the desert can be intermittently shaken by the forces wielded by nature, and find themselves yearning to profess their supplication upon the sands where they were born.\nThe feeble and meek fear this land, and only those strong of spirit can find themselves drifting free upon this golden ocean.\nAmongst the desertfolk, the bravest, most inured to the cruelties of their existence amidst the flowing sands are the mercenaries — The Eremites.\nSuch a life is one with little comfort or ease, so what a mercenary truly desires are those who can support them, with such covenant-kin being the equal of blood relatives.\nIn her youth, Dehya's family consisted of her father and his mercenaries.\nAs she grew to independence, her new family was the \"Blazing Beasts,\" fellow mercenaries she could trust and count on.\nAfter battling together for a time, a tacit understanding forms between individuals, with entire thoughts conveyed with but a movement, a gaze.\nLater, as she temporarily bid the desert farewell to commit to a commission in the rainforest, she often found herself reminiscing about the moments she spent with her companions, singing by the fireside.\nShe can rise as high as the sky or stray as far as the sea, but Dehya was and will always be a daughter of the sands.",
            "Character Story 2\tBefore one makes any individual comparisons, broadly speaking, females are slightly edged out by males in raw physicality.\nDehya, likewise, was not born with immense might. Even so, the other mercenaries have a great many reasons to hold her in high regard.\nFirstly, though she is not the strongest in her profession, she has force enough all the same.\nShould one doubt this, they merely need to test the weight of her blade. To make such a greatsword dance and flow without sufficient strength would be impossible otherwise.\nSecondly, she has tremendous combat instincts. It is known that the greatsword, Dehya's weapon of choice, demands a trade-off between force and speed. Should such a weapon fail to achieve a decisive first strike against a sufficiently mobile foe, it will prove more burden than a boon for the wielder. In moments like these, Dehya uses her superior insight and technique to overcome the opposition.\nSometimes, she will cast her weapon aside, eschewing the edge of a sword for the weight behind her fists. She will even hurl her weapon at foes without warning to buy a fleeting opportunity. How any such moment plays out all depends on the actual conditions presented by each battle.\nAside being good in a fight, she also knows plenty about surviving in the desert.\nThe commissions that the Eremites most often take will have them serving as bodyguards against raiders without outside support, herding away dangerous creatures, and assisting their clients in avoiding dreaded weather conditions.\nSometimes, they even find assignments that have them acting as guides, helping caravans, adventurers, and researchers reach their desired destinations.\nDehya knows how to deal with startled scorpion swarms, how to circle around vultures to avoid getting entangled with those nimble annoyances, and how to negotiate and minimize danger when faced with robbers.\nClients like it when matters are handled thoroughly and practically. To earn true praise from their employers, mercenaries must offer more than just brute capacity for violence.\nIndeed, the ability to overcome one hundred or even a thousand foes has its limits, for when sandstorms scour the earth and sky, even the mightiest warrior will be buried beneath its shroud.\nA wise mercenary knows when to retreat, and how to preserve themselves even while meeting their objectives, for doing so exemplifies the true heights of strategy.",
            "Character Story 3\tAs Dehya's reputation gradually grew amongst the Eremites, those of her band grew proud of the fame she was earning and, during a day when everyone happened to be present, the rowdiest of her companions stated their desire to grant her a nickname worth remembering.\nEveryone agreed that they would announce Dehya with the new nickname whenever she won future battles, so it needed to be something spectacular — capable of spreading goosebumps through people like a skin-raising plague.\nThe youngest members gave their all trying to come up with something. They chittered and clamored, trying to give Dehya a vicious moniker capable of instilling debilitating terror in potential clients, usually beginning with \"bloody\" or \"terror.\"\nDehya was not such an amateur as to think that a title alone might encapsulate the entirety of what others felt about her. But still, as if everyone wanted to kill some time on this matter, she didn't mind.\nAs she listened to bad suggestion after terrible suggestion, she couldn't help but guffaw with laughter. The atmosphere reminded her of moments from her childhood when her father gathered his compatriots to put on plays for her, detailing chivalrous heroes defending the helpless or messy brawls between siblings to amuse everyone. There was no specific point to it, except to bring some cheer while surviving in the vast emptiness under the desert's midnight sky.\nAnd just as the chatting was starting to put her in a good mood, that old ne'er-do-well's shadow slid back into her mind. Though admittedly disgruntled, Dehya did her best to keep the curl of her lips imperceptible.\nThat night, Dehya rejected several laughable names, such as the \"Sovereign of the Sands\" and \"The Crimson Edge.\" She thought it was time to let the farce come to a close. It was just a name after all, and true mercenaries did not let such things affect their business much.\nJust then, an aged mercenary interrupted the discussion. At first, he snorted disdainfully at the stupidity of those around him. Then, he asked a question: \"The Legend of the Lion. This story ring a bell for anyone?\"\nThis tale was, naturally, one Dehya was familiar with. During her childhood, her father had told her lots of old stories — far too many, really. She had wanted to forget everything that had to do with him, but memories are not so easily consigned to oblivion.\nWhile she was lost in the twists and turns of her past, her companions decided upon a title for her that actually sounded quite alright: \"Flame-Mane.\"\nAnd though she loathed the man The Legend of the Lion reminded her of, she found herself halted just before she could reject the name. Was it not all too petty to refuse such goodwill on that account?\nMust she avoid all the things related to her father, just because she wanted to forget him? Of course not. Besides, the story had brought a genuine feeling of warmth and comfort to Dehya, allowing her to face the world with open eyes, experience all it had to offer — and those experiences had not been falsehoods.\nSo why not take up the title of \"Flame-Mane?\" She could have done far worse.",
            "Character Story 4\tDehya is an individual of immense beauty, a fact undeniable to all who know her.\nShe is blessed with eyes of frosted sapphire capable of shivering souls, honeyed skin that bears a nigh-resplendent gleam when greeted by sunlight, and a length of wavy, black-and-gold hair that drifts behind her with every light-footed step she takes.\nThe desertfolk hold maidens imbued with attractiveness and vigor in great esteem, seeing them as embodiments of vitality.\nDehya, likewise, pays a great deal of attention to her looks. When she finds the opportunity, should her environment allow it, she always seizes the chance to take a shower and part her person from the stench of sweat. During her leisure time, she hits up the market for personal care products, procuring powder for her eyes and face alongside other cosmetics for times when she might need them. With how she uses these consumables daily, she often finds her supply depleting rapidly.\nMercenaries are typically a crude bunch, accustomed to violence with little focus placed on how they present themselves, making Dehya something of an oddity in that regard. Unable to understand why she is so concerned about her appearance, some of her companions have asked her as much.\nWell, what else could it be? The men of the desert smell so foul — a stench only made worse when they kick off their boots — that the nausea that follows is near-debilitating.\nCoated with sweat, having not washed their feet for the better part of a month, and reeking of alcohol, they infuse the air in a room with unfathomable rankness.\nImagine, an entire room filled with such unsanitary individuals. Mighty though Dehya might be, she has little desire to spend her time choking for breath.\nAs such, she sticks to a number of ironclad personal habits that separate her from the many slobs who plague their trade, leave her employers with a good impression, and keep her looking good at all times.\nA portion of her hard-earned Mora, likewise, is always placed into getting jewelry and cosmetics. She treats such purchases as rightful rewards derived from fruitful labor.\nWhen one is constantly surrounded by such fatiguing things as weapons, enemies, and business, a little care and gentleness go a long way toward lowering her defenses, allowing her to face the coming future with a softened heart.\nThough it is true that Dehya is a ferocious mercenary, she is, always first and foremost, a lovely and carefree woman.",
            "Character Story 5\tUnlike many who leave the desert and never look back, Dehya has always been proud of her heritage. However, her identity has indeed also introduced a great many obstacles into her life.\nShe lacked a systematized education and was in turn also bereft of any complex technical knowledge besides that which had to do with martial prowess and desert survival. Such was the case for many an Eremite mercenary.\nIt is clear to Dehya that this lack of knowledge has constrained her people and their potential, their energies and curiosity long subsumed by the sandstorms and the sweltering heat. If she hadn't encountered the miraculous creations of the Akademiya, tasted the fine wines of Mondstadt, beheld the elaborately crafted utensils from Liyue, or the mechanical brilliance possessed by the people of Fontaine, she too would have been unable to see past the borders of her environment.\nMeasured on merits of courage alone, the folk of the rainforest pale before the tenacious desertfolk. Avatars of determination, even after being lashed by the winnowing tongue of the withering winds for years uncounted, the people of the desert continue to live on, generation to generation, their bodies and minds as enduring as the rock of mountains, perhaps even more so.\nBut if they lack foresight to see beyond the present and visible, they will always only be crawling about in the sand.\nThe Mora they earn devoted solely to food and drink, their wealth flowing out as fast as it comes in, passing through them like the sand within an hourglass. The few among them who possessed foresight and intellect knew that to find a better life, changes were needed. But those individuals often cast the desert behind them upon embracing said better life, shifting to lives lived only for themselves.\n\"Why can't we be more? Why must we be bound to spending our strength — even our lives — to live just a little better?\"\nThey were made by the desert, but also shackled to it. Dehya desires to transcend such limitations. At present, she is still contemplating what kind of future she desires to seek.\nHow far someone can progress in life is not all determined by something as subjective as personal will — Dehya understands that all too well. But she also knows that, so long as there is a chance, she will try to deliver hope back to the desert, to do something for those still living there.\nThough her future paths may lead elsewhere, the sands will always be her home.",
            "The Legend of the Lion\tAccording to Kusayla, when a lion roars, even the blazing sun must shiver.\nLittle Dehya had never seen an actual lion before, so whatever Kusayla claimed, she heeded without question.\nKusayla would vividly describe how the sun would cleave the land with its heat, warping mud to powder and distorting the very air in the atmosphere. Despite this, the lion constantly thundered onward, striding across this burning plain. Try as the sun might, the lion's approach was constant and unrelenting, pursuing the star tirelessly with its roaring until the light finally fled past the horizon.\nSuch was the might of the lion.\nEnraptured by the story, little Dehya's eyes gleamed bright, brighter even than the campfire burning beneath a blanket of night.\n\"The lion can...\" Kusayla's eyes scythed about for a moment before he snatched one of his slimmer compatriots to use as a volunteer to complete his analogy. \"The lion can take out ten guys his size. Easy.\"\n\"What about you? Can you beat the lion?\" Little Dehya asked Kusayla.\n\"Hard to say, but I know quite a few tricks, so I think should be able to give that beast the business.\" Caution lit Kusayla's expression, betraying no hint of boasting.\n\"If the lion charges me, I'll... dip down beneath it, angle myself under its body, and then... Open its stomach with my blade. That should be enough to do it in.\"\nUnsatisfied with mere words, Kusayla called upon another of their band to pretend to be a lion, planning to give a personal performance for a triumph most hypothetical. Unfortunately, their acting left much to be desired, with the \"lion's\" roars crippled by a lack of presence, sounding more dog-like than anything.\nDehya was unsurprised. She knew what kind of character her father was. It was folly to take all he said seriously, and only disappointment awaited if one did so. All she really had to do was laugh along with him.\nThe Legend of the Lion, however, did linger in her recollections.\nMany years later, just as Dehya and her companions were deciding what title would sound best for her, the Lion was mentioned, pulling her back to this childhood fable, and her father, who had put everything into the form of a play for her.\nThough she had been estranged from Kusayla by then, she couldn't help but indulge in the nostalgia of her youth.\nNow, she finally understood what her father felt in his heart all those years ago, though he was now gone, adrift in the Eternal Dreamland.\nThis would prove one regret she would not be able to reverse. But still, one must veer toward optimism, for bitterness did not suit the lifestyle of one working in the desert. Besides, the memories of her preadolescence were now things she could openly look back upon with a sense of satisfaction.\nRecalling her girlhood, Dehya's eyes couldn't help but light up just as they had beside the campfire beneath the night sky all those years ago.\nShe would become a lion, akin to the one told of in Kusayla's story, so that the legend might yet live on through her.",
            "Vision\tDehya isn't all that sure when her Vision manifested precisely, but she guesses that it might have appeared when she had just started walking her own path.\nDuring that time, she was consumed with thoughts of growing stronger.\nAs a mercenary, being weak meant not being able to take on enough commissions, which in turn meant no Mora for food.\nIt was during this critical juncture that the Vision appeared by her side. With how stretched for Mora she was, she even considered trading it in for actual currency.\nPeople all say that to be granted a Vision is a sign of divine favor, but Dehya felt that if she was truly chosen, the gods would have sent her Mora instead of some trinket that lacked instant monetary value.\nAdditionally, though the Vision can help her direct the elements, victory in a true battle is still decided by skill, judgment, strategy, and physical conditioning.\nThere are many legendary mercenaries who achieved such renown even without a Vision, relying only on training and grit.\nDehya likewise understood that, should one become overcome by pride at having the gods' favor, stop thinking things through, and fail to appreciate that which is before them, no enemy would be required to punish such hubris. The desert itself would exact vengeance upon such folly on its own.\nThe things she would experience thereafter would serve as further proof that even divine power has limitations. For all their might and wisdom, even a god might be constrained.\nDehya likes her Vision, but she will not bend to become an apostle after a mere brush with divine attention.\nShe is a mercenary. Someone who lives and dies by the blade. Such a person trusts only in the sweat shed to feed countless gardens of battle and bloodshed."

            "Character Details\tAs the city of ballads and wines, Mondstadt's alcohol industry is renowned all over Teyvat.\nAs owner of the Dawn Winery, Diluc is essentially in charge of half the industry. This means he has a huge stream of revenue and an entire network of information, in the form of tavern patrons' gossip, right at his fingertips.\nIn a way, he is the uncrowned king of Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe scent of wine always lingers in the air in Mondstadt.\nIf one were to follow the scent to its source, one would invariably arrive at Diluc's Dawn Winery.\nA wooden plaque proudly announces the winery’s name, and beneath it is written the winery's motto:\n\"Shine True.\"\nMost interpret this to mean that the wines are brewed for consistency of taste, with time-honored techniques and that same healthy dose of sunny optimism that the dawn brings.\nMeanwhile, the more pragmatic Knights of Favonius are reminded of the long history of mutual support between the winery and the city.\nThe winery holds festivities from time to time. These events are routinely attended by enthusiastic fathers, eager to introduce their wonderful daughters to the young and single winery master.\nThis is all highly entertaining to the other guests, who watch on and comment, mockingly:\n\"We'd much rather Master Diluc stays married to the winery, given how good this wine is!\"\nDiluc deals impeccably with all situations, no matter who or what comes his way.\nDiluc is a fine young gentleman in every conceivable respect.\n",
            "Character Story 2\tDiluc avoids talking about the past.\n\"If only Diluc were still a member of the Knights...\"\nAfter a few drinks, senior knights will say words to this effect with a sigh.\nThey refer to events from a long time ago, back when Diluc's father, Master Crepus, was still the owner of the winery. Master Crepus' wish was for his son to become the most esteemed knight of all and safeguard Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.\nAs per his father’s wishes, Diluc trained rigorously to make himself worthy of the Ragnvindr name. Sure enough, he passed the Knights of Favonius' trials, swore the oath of protection to Mondstadt, and entered their ranks. Before long, he received an early promotion which saw him become the youngest-ever Cavalry Captain.\nOver the course of his missions and patrols, the denizens of Mondstadt gradually came to know this young and passionate Cavalry Captain.\nNo matter what the missions demanded from him, he always maintained his composure and his passion. No matter how big the challenge before him, his boundless courage always led him to the front line. The praise he received from his comrades and citizens spurred him on.\nBut the words of praise he valued most of all were:\n\"Good job. Now, that's my son.\"\nHis father's words fueled the fire inside his heart and served as his greatest motivation.\nHis faith was an unquenchable fire that burned strong and bright inside him.\nDiluc was so young back then.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"Sometimes, life can change in an instant.\"\nThe day that Crepus spoke these words to Diluc would turn out to be the latter's last as a Knight of Favonius.\nFor on that day, a horrific monster attacked the transport fleet he and his father were traveling with.\nThere was no time for Diluc to send for help. The monster was stronger than any foe the young Cavalry Captain had ever encountered, and overpowered him.\nDiluc could never have anticipated the way this battle would end: His father, who had been denied admittance into the Knights and who was shunned by the gods, defeated the monster with an unknown evil power — before that same power backfired, mortally wounding Crepus himself. Crepus died shortly after in his son's arms.\nWith a heavy heart, Diluc returned to the Knights' headquarters, only to receive an unthinkable order from Inspector Eroch: \"Conceal the truth.\"\nEroch insisted that the incident must be portrayed as an unfortunate accident in order to maintain the reputation of the Knights of Favonius in the eyes of the public.\nSuch was the sheer outrageousness of this request that Diluc did not think it was even worth trying to argue.\nDiluc's father had once said to him that the world would never turn its back on the faithful.\nBut now, the Knights of Favonius trampled on his faith like it was nothing. He couldn't help but wonder: What was his father's view on faith in his final moments?\nDiluc resigned from the Knights that day and left everything behind, including his Vision.\nHe swore to avenge his father's death, and to find the source of that occult power which had caused his father's demise.",
            "Character Story 4\tAfter Diluc resigned and discarded his Vision, he handed the running of the Dawn Winery over to the head housemaid and left Mondstadt altogether.\nDiluc traveled all across the seven nations of Teyvat in search of the truth.\nAll clues pointed toward a behemoth of an organization: The Fatui. He learned that they made counterfeit Visions in secret, calling them \"Delusions.\" A Delusion could amplify the power of its bearer to its extreme, but also carried the risk of backfiring. That was what had caused his father's death.\nWas it possible that his father could have obtained such a sacrilegious item in order to do good?\nDiluc knew he may never know the full truth, but that could never stop him from pursuing it.\nLike an eagle scouring the wilderness, he set off on his hunt for the truth. Determination burned like fire in his heart, unfathomable enigmas and unending battles could not sway him from his course. He pressed on relentlessly, scarred but undeterred, like a fiery tornado burning through the dense fog of mystery.\nThe Fatui's rulers, the Harbingers, monitored Diluc's progress from the shadows. The prowess with which he laid waste to numerous Fatui strongholds caught their attention and forced them to take action.\nDiluc narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Harbingers thanks to a third-party observer from the north, who was part of a vast underground intelligence network. The observer claimed to have been watching Diluc for some time, and approved of his methods.\nAfter his close encounter with death, Diluc took a long hard look at his past and the anger he had harbored for so long. Acknowledging his shortcomings, he decided to join the underground intelligence network.\nJust like when he first joined the Knights of Favonius, Diluc committed himself fully to his work. His talents and skills saw him rise steadily through the ranks into the upper echelons of the network.\nThe network was made up of volunteers, and many of its members had willingly given up their prior positions and reputations to join. Some had even abandoned their names.\nCould working with these new comrades finally restore the faith he once clung to? The faith that had been all but destroyed in the events surrounding his father's death?",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Shine True.\" The background to this motto is hotly contested, but to Diluc it has one simple, clear meaning.\n\"Evil cannot go unpunished.\nNever settle for mediocrity. Never forget that the dawn will one day come.\"\nDiluc's solitary sojourn lasted for three years.\nFour years on, Diluc had returned to Mondstadt and taken over as head of the family winery, now a young man.\nIn the space of these four years, Eroch had been purged from the Knights of Favonius after being shown to be a traitor, while Grand Master Varka had left on an expedition, leaving Master Jean to assume the role of Acting Grand Master.\nThe return of the Dawn Winery's master should have been a momentous occasion for Mondstadt, but strangely it went completely unnoticed.\nThe reason? Mondstadt's citizens were far too busy pondering the mysterious case of an unknown \"Guardian of Mondstadt.\"\nAll that was known about the anonymous guardian was that the smell of burning would follow in his wake, and that a flash of red flames would reveal his silhouette for but a moment in the darkness of the night, before he disappeared in an instant.\nThe bodies of monsters that had plagued Mondstadt for an age now lay dead in the wilderness... Mondstadt's most wanted thieves suddenly appeared bound and gagged, hanging from their feet in the statue plaza... All the Knights of Favonius were dispatched to reckon, once and for all, with the Abyss Mage behind countless crimes in the city, but they arrived only to discover that he had long since been killed...\nAided by wine-fueled conversations, word of the mysterious guardian spread swiftly, and he came to be known as the \"Darknight Hero.\"\nIn public, Diluc appeared to hold this hero in contempt, his face curling up in disgust every time the name was uttered.\nElzer of the Mondstadt Wine Guild was one of the select few who was in the know, and once queried Diluc about this: Was his disapproval of the Darknight Hero just an act, intended to throw the knights off his trail and protect his anonymity?\nBut Diluc simply frowned once more, and curtly replied: \"It's just a stupid name.\"",
            "Dawn Winery's Apple Cider\tDiluc may hold the whole wine industry in the palm of his hand, but he himself is not fond of wine.\nAt Diluc's request, the Dawn Winery developed several alcohol-free beverages, a decision which was met with resounding approval from those in Mondstadt who could not drink alcohol but still wanted to partake in the drinking culture.\nOne of those alcohol-free beverages is Mondstadt's Apple Cider, the success of which is on a par with Dandelion Wine in terms of monthly sales volumes.\nSome think that Diluc must have such high standards when it comes to wine that he is never seen drinking the mediocre-quality beverages that are available to the public.\nOthers think that drinking wine must surely remind him of his father, and that that is why he does not touch it.\nWhen pressed about his drinking habits, he responds by saying that alcohol clouds his thoughts, and consuming it would impact his day-to-day work.\nBut the thing that people don't understand is: What kind of day-to-day work does a winery master do, if it requires him to never touch a drop of alcohol?",
            "Vision\tCrepus had two regrets in life. One was never becoming a knight, and the other was never obtaining a Vision.\nFor this reason, in the moment that Diluc received his Vision, he took it as a recognition by the gods of his and his father's shared ambition — finally, he could make his father proud.\nJust a few years later, his father died on a dark and gloomy day. The hopes and dreams that burned bright in Diluc's Vision were extinguished in the torrential rain that fell on that night.\nNo matter how upright and good-hearted a person may be, death will still come to them without warning.\nIs this where the tale of justice ends? Just like that?\nIt seemed to him that his Vision and his status as a knight were both equally ineffectual at enabling him to protect the things that he treasured most. It was time to discard them both, he decided.\nWhen he recognized his own powerlessness, his Vision became but a burden, of no greater service than a Delusion.\nEmpty titles were of no interest to him. He sought after ardent flames that would burn brighter than any other, and an unshakable resolve. Only a firm resolve can drive the truth-seeker forward, and only ardent flames can vanquish the ice that freezes the hand of justice.\nOn the day that Diluc returned to Mondstadt, he took up his Vision once more. The events of his years away had purged him of his childish immaturity, and turned him into a hero ready to shoulder his father's will once more. Each night, from the shadows, he fought for Mondstadt.\nHe did not discuss the past. But he did not deny the past, either.\nTo the lost, perhaps a Vision is a beacon of light given by the gods to help them find the path forward.\nBut to those with conviction, a Vision is simply an extension of their strength, a medium for channeling their willpower, a tribute to the experiences that have shaped them, and a testament to the story of their life so far."

It bewitches people and makes them stupid!\"\nThis is the source of Diona's hatred for alcohol, and the beginning of Cat's Tail's turn in fortunes.\nThat said, Margaret, the owner of Cat's Tail, had never expected any of this to happen at all. Rather, she had a much simpler reason for hiring Diona.\n\"What choice did I have? She's just too cute.\"",

She bites when piqued, so please be careful.\"\nThus did Dr. Edith write of Diona in her notes for \"Studies Into Bloodlines Strange and Unfamiliar.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tDiona's appearance did indeed have an impact on Mondstadt's alcohol industry.\nThe Dawn Winery's long-held monopoly was broken overnight by this unexpected ambush from Cat's Tail, and the man put in charge of the winery's business, Elzer, found this unacceptable.\nA calculating veteran of many industrial battles, Elzer considered poaching this key figure, never realizing that Diona considered the Dawn Winery a sort of \"final boss\" to be defeated in her quest.\n\"This marvelous and bold method of preparation must be the secret of these flavors, yes?\"\nDiona simply looked at the white-haired man who had just sat down in front of the bar, rank displeasure in her eyes.\n\"Ah.

I was bitten by a cat.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThere is a legend about a \"spring fairy\" that circulates in Diona's hometown.\nThe fairy once saved a mother and son who had despaired beside a well, filling the barren hole with rushing waters that pooled and formed a spring. The child, deathly ill, was miraculously healed by those spring waters.\nMany people came to catch a glimpse of these blessed waters, and built a settlement around it, and left it not thereafter. Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.\nNowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.\nOnly little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.\nThese were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful — feelings worth answering.\nThat was what the spring fairy believed.\nSo, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.\nOn the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.\n\"I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow.\"\nFrom that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.\nTill today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream.",
            "Cold Cocktail Shaker\tDiona's father Draff is also interested in mixing the occasional drink.\nDiona's tail would wag from side to side of its own accord as she watched her father rocking the shaker back at forth at night.\nBut young Diona also found that her father would wind up particularly drunk on such nights, becoming dead to the world before he could even finish her bed-time story.\nThus, when Draff went out to hunt one day, she hid the shaker, squirreling it away in the deepest place under her bed.\nUnexpectedly, her father didn't bother looking for the lost shaker at all. He simply brought a new one back the very next day.\nWhen Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.\nEver skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift.\n\"Now, this suits you far better,\" Margaret said with a satisfied nod.",
            "Vision\tDiona's antipathy towards alcohol is not \"hate\" per se. Instead, it can be considered a form of \"avarice.\"\nShe wishes for her father to always be the man that she admires, and she treasures every moment that she spends with her family, unwilling to \"share\" her happiness with the wine.\nThere was once a storm that lasted for three days, and for those three days, her father, who had been out hunting, did not return.\nThe awful weather prevented the search parties sent by the Knights of Favonius from making much headway, and soon the dread of \"loss\" began to hang over Diona like a shroud.\nIf she could not even stand to \"share,\" how could she bear having something utterly \"stolen\" from her?\nShe burst out the door and into the tempest, and the waters that stood in her path were frozen by some power she did not recognize.\nUsing her superlative tracking skills, she found her father under a broken gorge.\nWith the help of the other hunters, she returned home with her father, and only once she realized that he would be fine did she finally smile again.\n\"Do you... want me to mix you a drink? It'll numb the pain a little...\"\nThat was probably the first time she ever mixed a drink in a normal fashion.\n\"Ooh, it's so refreshing. It's wonderful! Hahaha—Ouch...\"\nGetting to drink a cocktail that his daughter had made was probably a better anesthetic by far than the alcohol itself.\nStill, Diona gaining power over Cryo did not help reconcile her to wine at all."

Please, have a listen, and if you like what you hear, then perhaps you would spare me...\"",

Just as she was beginning to feel helpless, she happened to find a magic lamp in her warehouse. She began to polish the lamp, when all of a sudden, a puff of red smoke came out. The smoke spoke to her and claimed to be The Genie of Beauty and Kindness. The merchant somehow reminded the genie of her own lovely daughter, so she kindly offered to grant the merchant a wish.",

So the merchant wished that she could earn more Mora in the future than she could ever hope to count.

            "More About Dori: V\tHearing the merchant's story, the Fog Div became very puzzled. The div and the genie were obviously of the same species, so how come the div couldn't perform any magic? The merchant praised the Fog Div's potential, saying that it, too, would surely gain the genie's great power if only it were to stay in the same magic lamp. The Fog Div agreed and entered the merchant's magic lamp... Huh? Is this a real story? Backstory details cost extra! Give me another 990,000 Mora and I'll tell you!",

            "Character Details\t\"Dori Sangemah Bay, owner of the Palace of Alcazarzaray, super-duper merchant who sells everything you need!\"\nWhen one holds Dori's name card, this impressive title instantly comes into view.\nDori is, however, indeed the most special Sumeru merchant of all.\nShe already possesses vast wealth, but is still fervently passionate about earning Mora;\nShe already owns multiple well-renowned merchant caravans, yet she always travels across Sumeru to sell her marvelous items in person.\nSpeaking of which, her wares are just as curious as her style: special travel kit, outdoor dryer machines, automatic snowball launchers... You can probably buy anything you can think of from Dori. The only question is: Do you have enough Mora to do so?",
            "Character Story 1\t\"Oh wow, are you headed for the desert? I have some good stuff you'll need there.\"\n\"The rainforest is terribly infested with poisonous snakes, ferocious monsters, and a terminal case of humidity — it's no place for the less-than-thoroughly prepared, no sir! Now then, why don't you try bringing this for your trip? Buy it now and enjoy a 20 percent discount!\"\n\"Hold your horses, hotshot. You're not taking that route, are you? There's a huge pack of monsters lying in wait ahead that-a-ways. But see, I have some weapons here that you won't regret purchasing — you know, for self defense!\"\n\"Going to the Akhtamun Ruins? You've got the right person. First things first, you'll need a complete set of water-drawing tools... Which, as it happens, I happen to have for sale!\"\nThere is a tale among adventurers in Sumeru.\nIt says that if you are about to embark on a journey into a dangerous place, you'll see a diminutive figure, seemingly having been waiting for you.\nBe it in the treacherous mountains, arid deserts, grim rainforests, or desolate areas inhabited by monsters, you'll always see her smiling face.\nWord has it that Dori carries all manner of marvelous items on her person all the time. Her items can help adventurers get through their pressing troubles.\n—At a \"reasonable\" price, of course.\nAdventurers who \"have just received Dori's help in their time of need\" at the cost of \"paying a large sum of Mora at once\" often develop conflicted feelings toward her — somewhere in between gratitude and a grudge.\nFor Dori's part, she considerately ignores the conflicted look on their faces, putting the fresh Mora in her almost-bursting purse and bidding them adieu with a contented smile.\n\"Thank you for your generous purchase. Hehe.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tFrom the perspective of others, Dori's business has always been on the up and up. However, only Dori herself knows how many unimaginable bottlenecks she's struggled through.\nThere was a time when orders from all over Sumeru just kept flooding in and Dori couldn't deliver such a giant number of orders in a timely fashion.\nUnfortunately, the capacity of the usual merchant routes was too limited for the delivery of commodities in such a gigantic quantity.\nMany members of Dori's merchant caravans suggested rejecting certain orders to dial down the scale of delivery and maintain a decent, stable profit — one that already seemed set to make them immensely wealthy, given time.\nBut Dori took a very bold step: She accepted all the orders while starting cooperation with the Kshahrewar to establish new trade routes in areas that were known to be dangerous.\nShe opened the new routes up to nearby merchant caravans, took the opportunity to found a commerce guild and put the relevant resources to good use, and finally eliminated the bottleneck that her business was stuck in.\nToday, Dori's new, built-from-scratch merchant routes are seen all across Sumeru, and the good reputation of \"Lord Sangemah Bay\" has spread far and wide.\nThe words Dori said to her caravan members have also become common knowledge:\n\"I'm not some stupid toadstool. I don't cancel or reject any orders.\"\n\"Every Mora that can be earned, will be earned by me. Why? Well, because it's there, of course.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tDori used to suffer terribly from insomnia. Back then, she would often lose sleep for no reason. After such sleepless nights, she would show up to trade meetings with a pair of raccoon eyes.\nEven the best doctors couldn't diagnose her properly. She burned one frankincense stick after another, and yet they did not lull her into sleep but into coughing fits instead.\nIt was at that moment that a doctor passed by and told Dori this:\n\"I've heard that some people place an hourglass by their bedside. The sound of the falling sand helps them sleep.\"\nDori tried it for a few days and it didn't work. However, she was inspired by the failed attempt, ordering a large custom-made hourglass.\nThat which was in this hourglass was not sand, but shiny Mora.\nThat night, embraced by the music of jingling Mora, Dori slept soundly at last.\nAfter that, Dori learned the trick to dealing with insomnia:\n\"To sleep well, you must first secure peace of mind.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tMaybe it's because of her deep love for Mora, Dori also takes interest in \"whoever or whatever might bring Mora in.\"\nFor example, her merchant caravans use Sumpter Beasts to carry cargo, so Dori had an \"amusement park\" built for the Sumpter Beasts such that they might enjoy their downtime.\nShe also handpicks Sumpter Beast food of the best quality to make sure that they have balanced nutrition and that they stay in good health.\nAlso, as a shrewd merchant, she never misses a single business opportunity.\nSumpter Beasts playing together in the amusement park make for a fun scene, so Dori took the chance to open the amusement park to tourists and sold tickets, food, and souvenirs to them. The cost of raising the Sumpter Beasts was covered by the amusement park's revenue in no time.\nDori's love for Sumpter Beasts is genuine, and so is her intention to make Mora out of that love.\nPerhaps the Jinni in Dori's lamp knows this better than everyone else. The spirit was tricked into entering Dori's lamp, but it has never left since.\nDori will summon it into combat, but she will also grant its wishes afterwards.\nSometimes the Jinni even thinks that the fairy tale might actually have gotten things reversed —\nFor the one who dwells in the lamp is a powerful fighter, while the one holding the lamp is the one who grants wishes.",
            "Character Story 5\tNo one knows how exactly Dori met Alice, but they are truly a pair of business partners that could make all merchants jealous.\nAlice travels the world, so she does not stay for long every time she visits Sumeru. However, every once in a while, Alice will ask someone to send her new invention to Dori.\nDori, for her part, will sell it and find a way to send the Mora to Alice.\nSometimes, Alice sends the invention with an attached letter that tells Dori to keep the Mora for the time being because Alice is currently in a dangerous area.\nHowever, Dori insists on getting someone to send the Mora to safe zones closest to Alice's position, making sure that Alice will receive the Mora at her earliest convenience.\nThe labor, shipment, insurance... The various costs tend to amount to a fairly large expenditure, but Dori is never stingy in this regard. She even pays in advance.\n\"I, Dori, never default on payment.\"\n\"Also, Ms. Alice has expenses, too. I must make sure that she has Mora at hand whenever she needs it.\"\nDori often repeats these words and, despite the trouble, repeatedly makes sure that Alice's payment is delivered.\nThough Alice is no longer Dori's only supplier, Alice's payment is still a top priority for Dori.\nPerhaps it's because Dori keeps a certain promise embedded in her heart — the promise she made to Alice the day they met.\n\"You want limitless Mora? Sure. I can supply you with marvelous items of all kinds. But how much Mora you're going to make will depend on how good you are at sales.\"\n\"Don't worry. I'll sell them for a good price, earn a large sum of Mora, and deliver your share as quickly as possible... I'll be your greatest business partner.\"",
            "Mora Music Box\tTo better enjoy the fascinating clinking of Mora, Dori ordered a custom-made \"Mora Music Box.\"\nOn top of the music box is a slot precisely the size of a single Mora.\nInsert a Mora through the slot into the box, and it will roll along the intricate tracks inside and make pleasant clinking sounds.\nThese sounds compose beautiful music to which Dori twirls in the grand Palace of Alcazarzaray.\n\"Mora, Mora, shining brightly.\"\n\"Mora, Mora, toward infinity.\"\n\"Beautiful Mora, Dori's Mora.\"\n\"Everyone's Mora, come to Dori.\"\nDori's sung this song countless times, yet she's never tired of it.\nAt the end of her dance, Dori takes a deep bow to her imaginary audience.\nIt is also the moment when the Mora falls to the bottom of the music box, making the final clink —\nWith this finishing touch, an imaginary curtain descends upon Dori's delightful dance.\nHowever, Dori is never quite finished — she always has another Mora to slot into her music box.",
            "Vision\tTwo girls of similar ages hummed a melody that was slightly out of tune. They spent their innocent childhood hand-in-hand as constant companions.\nThey each picked flowers to decorate the other's hair in spring and walked across creeks barefoot in summer.\nThey slid down the golden sand dunes in autumn and shared a book in the warmth of the winter sunlight.\nIt seemed that such happy times would never come to an end.\nThat is, until the elder sister started coughing blood for no reason. At this time, their home came to be ringed by a great many strange adults.\nThe strangers explained the elder sister's situation in serious tones and with unfathomable jargon before sighing at the dingy little room.\nThe younger sister had no idea what was happening, but she visited her sister every day, and her sister would always say this to her with a bright smile:\n\"It's alright. I just need some rest.\"\nSeeing that smile, the innocent younger sister's eyes filled with expectation. She even began looking forward to playing together like they used to.\nBut one day, she saw her sister gripping her chest while telling a story.\nThen, when her frail form collapsed onto the bed, the younger sister reached out to catch her, only to find that her body was so very light.\n...It was almost as if her sister were a feather, a feather that might drift away to some place far, far away.\nLater on, the younger sister found a crumpled note.\nIt was a doctor's prescription, with a list of herbs that were desperately scarce — the collectors who had such herbs were few and far between.\nTo purchase those herbs would cost more than tens of millions of Mora, an impossible price for a family that was already struggling to make the ends meet.\nThe elder sister always shook her head with a smile to dismiss her family's insistence on following the prescription. Perhaps she herself could only find the courage to glance at that note in the deep hours of the night — and dare to dream that she might \"live.\"\nUpon finding out about the note, the younger sister put it into her pocket silently and resolved to save her sister.\n\"I must make a lot of Mora.\"\n\"With enough Mora, my family will never have to smile at me while swallowing their pain, and I will never have to lose anything due to lacking Mora...\"\nPerhaps it was at that moment that the gods looked upon her with mercy.\nBut to an \"ambitious\" person like her, getting a Vision was just the start.\nIn the countless days and nights that have followed, she has constantly kept herself calm and clear-headed, telling herself:\n\"Conviction alone is not enough. I will work hard for what I desire until the end of my days.\"\n\"There's nothing that Lord Sangemah Bay cannot achieve.\""

Either way, things like this don't escape me. I know my team.",
            "More About Eula: I\tThe life of a Lawrence doesn't include much worth talking about... Basically, whatever you say, whatever you do, people will always despise you and treat you like a potential threat to society. It's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, though. Before I'd joined the Knights, good grief... I couldn't even buy groceries. Even Good Hunter and Mondstadt General Goods wouldn't take my money. I literally had to go out and hunt my own food and cook it over a campfire if I wanted to eat dinner.",
            "More About Eula: II\tPeople tell me that if I just spoke more softly, or was more polite, or acted more deferentially, others may find it easier to forgive me, but the only reason they think that way is because they've never been branded a pariah before. There is no easy path to redemption when you're a social pariah. I'm more inclined to stop tiptoeing around everyone all the time and just get out there and make them respect me the old-fashioned way! As in, we square off and if they win, I humbly accept my punishment, but if they lose, they must acquiesce to my demands... Such as... Well, I mean, if I want to buy a loaf of bread, take my darn money, for crying out loud!",
            "More About Eula: III\tThe Knights of Favonius are actually fairly reasonable, at the very least they reward merit and not social status. The reason they invited me to join their ranks is because I'd sparred with some of their crack troops and won through my own sheer skill. Being an insider in the organization will make getting revenge much easier, as it removes many of life's complications, so what's not to love?",
            "More About Eula: IV\tThe name Lawrence only became a social stigma after the clan fell from grace. It was once an honor to be called a Lawrence, but unfortunately, most people have forgotten about that part of history. The Grand Master says that I am performing rather well as a knight, and that if it's not enough to restore the honor of the Lawrence name, it's certainly a strong rebuttal against the one-sided opinions so many people throw around. I'm quite satisfied with that appraisal.",
            "More About Eula: V\tIf my family members refuse to change their corrupt ways, or worse, continue to cause active harm in Mondstadt... I should be the one to end them, along with the Lawrence name itself. For once, it'd be a family obligation I'd actually enjoy. And once the deed was done, I'd be free to pick any name I wanted. Or even let you pick one for me!",
            "Eula's Hobbies\tI'm into all sorts of cool things.

            "Eula's Troubles\tSometimes, when it's busy in the tavern, they ask me to share a table with other customers.

            "Favorite Food\tI like making my own treats. Not always your typical sweet treats, though. For example, a Chilled Tomato and Aspic Jelly Egg Roll pairs very nicely with an ice-cold glass of Berry & Mint Punch. The most important thing is that they leave the people who like eating them with big smiles on their faces.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI can't stand a rich broth. The flavor is too overpowering, it's so filling you can't train or fight afterward, and also, it doesn't really work as field rations... Simply put, broth and I are sworn enemies!",

            "Character Details\tEula's role within the Knights of Favonius is Captain of the Reconnaisance Company.\nThe nature of her work means that she rarely sets foot in the city — she spends most of her time out in the wild, leading her team of scouts as they hunt down Abyss Order operatives and other monsters.\nKnown as the Spindrift Knight, Eula wields her blade with consummate skill, but perhaps more importantly, she is well-versed in strategy and possesses great courage and excellent intuition. Grand Master Varka had nothing but the highest praise for her, even declaring once that she was the Dandelion Knight's equal on the battlefield.\nOn the face of it, to have two such outstanding knights attending to the defense of Mondstadt in a single generation should be a cause for nothing but celebration. But dig a little deeper and there is a fundamental difference between Jean and Eula.\nFor Eula is a descendant of the once-aristocratic Lawrence Clan. The blood that flows through her veins once flowed through those of Mondstadt's oppressors during one of the darkest periods of the city's history.\nConsequently, Eula has been viewed with contempt by the citizens of Mondstadt since birth. The Lawrence name stands for a legacy of depravity and despotism that stains Mondstadt's past and scars the minds of its citizens even to this day.\nSo, whenever Eula appears, old wounds resurface. People despise the aristocracy, and this does no favors for her reputation.\nHowever, Eula is strong-willed and in spite of everything, she joined the Knights of Favonius and rose to the rank of Captain.\nWhen people in the city voiced their reservations, she would respond head-on, claiming that her chosen course of action was out of a desire for \"vengeance.\" This matter-of-fact confession would alarm them all the more and has convinced everyone that she joined the Knights of Favonius only to serve as a mole for the former aristocracy.\nOne person who sees things differently is Acting Grand Master Jean. In fact, she speaks rather fondly of Eula.\n\"The rumors are all groundless. The Spindrift Knight is simply misunderstood, that's all.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tOn the one hand, she is a descendant of the disgraced Lawrence Clan, the scion of a corrupt aristocracy. On the other, she is one of the top two sword fighters in Mondstadt.\nIn other words, Eula is equal parts tainted blood and superior swordsmanship.\nThere is no knowing when she might strike, nor what she might take from you... In the eyes of the citizens of Mondstadt, the Reconnaissance Captain is as unpredictable and tumultuous as the waves on a stormy sea.\nEula responds with a cold haughtiness to accusations of this nature. To any who dare insinuate such things to her face, she replies, \"How dare you. Hmph, I will remember this.\"\nShe is consumed by the desire to avenge herself, but is often on the move far away from the city. Sometimes upon her return to Mondstadt, she will brandish her greatsword and march straight to the Knights of Favonius headquarters.\nOn one occasion, two fresh recruits standing guard on their first day on patrol watched just such a scene play out before their eyes. Alarmed and unsure how to respond, they ultimately did not dare to intervene. Instead, they simply watched on helplessly while Eula made a beeline for Master Jean's office.\nMuch to their surprise, however, hours passed and no sound of a struggle was heard from within.\nStill worried, the guards raised their concerns to Cavalry Captain Kaeya and Librarian Lisa as they were passing by.\n\"The Reconnaissance Captain is back again? When you saw her, was she marching towards Jean's office with her sword in hand, looking like she wanted to settle a score?\"\n\"Goodness, I must head there straight away. How can they have a tea break without me?\"\nLisa hurried to Jean's office the moment she finished speaking. Meanwhile, Kaeya took the two guards outside and explained to them whilst trying to suppress a fit of the giggles:\n\"We all know that the Acting Grand Master is a good judge of character, don't we? The Knights of Favonius are interested in a person's ability, not their family history. That's why she gives up her time to spar with the Reconnaissance Captain. In doing so, she can preserve the dignity of the Knights of Favonius while also providing a way of settling old grievances. Quite brilliant, don't you think?\"\n\"Ohh... S—So that's how it is...\" \"...So 'tea break' is code for 'sparring'...?\"\nThis kind of thing occurs almost on a monthly basis. But... if they're engaged in some sort of strange sparring ritual in there for the sake of settling old grievances and honing their fighting skills... How come they don't make a ton of noise?",
            "Character Story 2\tIn truth, Eula is nothing like the fearsome predator many imagine her to be. On the contrary, constantly being met with prejudice at every turn means she is often the victim.\nAt one time, shops would refuse to sell her their goods, restaurants would put no care and attention into her orders, and the citizens on her patrol route would refuse to cooperate with her. So, Eula's work is fraught with difficulties.\nWhen conflict arises, Eula fights back with a sternly worded threat to indicate that she will remember this grievance and make the offending party pay for it one day. It seems to work like a magic spell, because as soon as these words are uttered, the conflict ceases immediately without ever having to escalate to the level of an all-out confrontation.\nFunnily enough, although people always have their guard up around Eula, she is a law-abiding citizen and has never harmed another Mondstadter in her life. She may come across as having a somewhat frosty demeanor, but she is entirely scrupulous in her speech and conduct.\nNo one can ever find fault with her actions, and as people gradually get to know her, their morbid fear of her will dissipate. They will also start to realize her threats of vengeance are nothing more than a figure of speech that simply serve as a verbal warning in the moment.\nEula, who may or may not be working to bring down the Knights of Favonius from the inside... Eula, who may or may not be an aristocrat mole... New recruits in the Knights of Favonius find her the most difficult person to deal with.\nWhen Jean sends a new recruit to track down Eula in the wilds and deliver a new set of verbal orders, they always receive the same response: \"If you have to resort to tasking the descendant of your former oppressors with doing your work, then perhaps you are not as strong as I thought.\"\nBut despite the antagonism in her words, she will complete her newly assigned tasks to perfection. The new recruit is invariably forced to admit that with her abilities, it is no wonder she was able to achieve a captaincy within just a few years of joining the Knights.\nEveryone knows Eula as the frosty and antagonistic Spindrift Knight, the aristocrat who has a score to settle with the Knights of Favonius, an openly hostile and potentially dangerous individual... but is this really the truth of who she is?\nOn the way back, the new recruit thinks back over Eula's every action.\n\"What was that kind and resilient look I saw in her eyes when she wasn't looking at me? She seems to take her work seriously... So, surely she can be relied on after all?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tMondstadt is a city of freedom and happiness where even the descendants of a disgraced former ruling class can find true friends.\nFortunately, there is one person whom Eula can rely on to be her spokesperson to the Mondstadt masses, and that person is Outrider Amber.\nEverybody loves Amber, so when she is around, shopkeepers will sell their wares to Eula at the normal price. If they're in an especially good mood, they may even exchange a few words with her during the process. It is at moments like this that Eula shows her most agreeable side.\nBecause of this, and because Amber is just so nice, she'll often accompany Eula on trips out, or even run all her errands for her and deliver the goods straight to her home.\nAmber is also the reason that the city folk end up hearing all about the Reconnaissance Captain's accomplishments out in the field. Each time Amber informs them of Eula's long list of achievements in battle, they can't help but let out a little gasp of surprise.\nEarly one weekend morning, Amber stood atop a makeshift stage of wooden crates and began announcing Eula's latest highlights: \"Recently, the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Captain saved the life of a woman at Dornman Port. After further investigation with this woman's close cooperation, she then proceeded to successfully capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port. The woman in question was a renowned legal expert from Liyue, and the Knights of Favonius have since received official correspondence from the Liyue Communications Office thanking the Reconnaissance Captain for her deeds...\"\nWhether because Amber's persistent efforts have overcome historical prejudices or because Eula's achievements as a knight have quelled the long-standing fear in people's hearts, Eula's life has changed noticeably in recent years. Most of the city folk are no longer openly hostile towards her, and she has won over the members of the Knights of Favonius with her consistent results in the field.\nAs for the members of the Reconnaissance Company under her leadership, they support her unconditionally. They always have her back when they head out to Mondstadt's outskirts to defend the peace of their nation.\nOf course, the person who has always tirelessly rooted for Eula, and who is now the most delighted to see people's attitudes towards her change, is Amber. They had been friends for a long time before Eula ever joined the Knights of Favonius, and as the beloved mentee of Amber's grandfather, the first Outrider, Eula has her complete trust.",
            "Character Story 4\tOne might not expect this from her frosty attitude and sharp tongue, but Eula is a talented chef.\nThe Reconnaissance Company today prides itself on having the best field rations in the Knights of Favonius. One staple of their inventory is a moon-shaped pie. Though a field ration, this wonderfully delicious and highly portable food is loved by all who try it.\nThe Reconnaissance Company's designated chef once admitted that when developing this item, she was inspired by the captain's own baked goods. She extended the baking time to make the crust tougher and also substituted a few highly perishable ingredients with ones that last longer, reducing the cost while significantly prolonging the shelf life.\nEven after such a major change to the recipe, the pie still tasted delicious. So, whenever the scouts are snacking, they can't help but wonder: If this is the field ration version, how delicious must the captain's original recipe taste?\nThe answer to this question is buried deep within the pages of a dusty old book in the library. The Lawrence Clan may have been overthrown a long time ago, but they have never given up hope of one day rising again and reclaiming their place as the ruling class. So that they are always prepared for this monumental moment, their offspring are subjected to an educational regime so unbelievably harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.\n\"Noble obligations\" must be performed to absolute perfection in every possible sense, and these obligations cover etiquette, ritual, and study as well as cooking and other domestic chores.\nIn the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, \"Post-liberation Mondstadt lacks etiquette and taste. When the day comes for our clan to seize power once more, there shall be none who are qualified to be our servants. We must be cautious. We must never stoop to the level of the commoners and set foot in the quagmire of vulgarity.\"\nThe Lawrence Clan's culinary arts teacher was particularly strict. If your dough was missing a half-spoonful of flour, or if your condiment was a few grains of salt short, or if you were two seconds late removing something from the oven, you were likely to be both scolded and disciplined. As far as Eula is concerned, the haute cuisine revered by the aristocrats is just another worthless consequence of people dogmatically following outdated rules.\nFor this reason, the only kind of person who Eula will permit to try her own home baking is someone who she... respects...? No, that would be taking it too far. Rather, it should be someone who she grudgingly accepts \"will keep following me around and bothering me, seemingly undeterred by my warnings, despite having crossed me many times to date.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tBesides traditional etiquette, art is the second most highly prized asset to the aristocrats, known as the \"second soul.\"\nThe \"Dance of Sacrifice\" — a ritual used by illustrious families to display their nobility — is thought of as the crystallized form of this soul, the prize gem in the ruler's scepter.\nFolklore holds that Mondstadt's most illustrious clans jointly created the Dance of Sacrifice long before the aristocracy's reign of bloodshed began.\nThe third act, which represents the Lawrence Clan, is a solo dance known as \"Flickering Candlelight.\" The most important part of the Dance of Sacrifice, it was performed by the most senior dancer, who was typically the eldest daughter of the clan.\nThe Lawrence Clan would summon top dancers to serve as tutors for the eldest daughter and ensure it was performed to perfection. Bleeding toes were seen as a point of pride and a rite of passage for every dancer.\nThis ancient ceremony was a continuous tradition for so long that even today, long after being expelled by the people of Mondstadt, the Lawrence Clan still honors it.\nHowever, without the grand banquet and the gorgeous stage that once featured prominently in ceremonial performances, the Dance of Sacrifice is now far from the grandiose affair it once was. Furthermore, the stringent requirements regarding the dancer's posture and movements have also been relaxed due to the lack of tutors. In the end, the Lawrence Clan reluctantly decided that it could no longer be a mandatory part of the curriculum, and they relegated it to an artistic pastime.\nOver time, the negative connotations and elitist expectations associated with this dance have faded away, and today it survives simply as a graceful dance.\nAs the eldest daughter of the present-day Lawrence Clan, Eula found it to be a relaxing pastime in her youth and a welcome respite from her other grueling courses of study.\nToday, Eula appears to have put her artistic pursuits behind her. At least, no one pictures dancing when they think of the Spindrift Knight.\nNevertheless, a distinctly dance-like aesthetic can be observed in Eula's bladework, along with an elegant rhythm and musicality that are difficult to capture in words.\nAs her greatsword rises and falls and sways to and fro, her distinctive and graceful poise is like that of a dancer under the moonlight: faraway, immaculate, and sublime.",
            "Glaciers and Waves\tEula is the bearer of the Lawrence family crest, the \"Glacial Seal.\" It is the highest martial symbol of the clan and represents the spirit of the Lawrence Clan in the early days of Mondstadt before their fall from grace: cold and unsullied, undaunted by any flame, composed and unshaken in all circumstances.\nFew among their number have passed the clan's trials in a thousand years, and the hopes of the clan are passed down from one seal-bearer to the next.\nEula was still quite young when she underwent the trial but she passed with ease, taking up the seal in the process. Then she departed with that badge of honor in her possession and has barely contacted the clan since.\nHer icy sword is a manifestation of the strength represented by the seal, striking with the cold, brutal force of a relentless blizzard and driving her foes into retreat.\nYet, sharp and bright as ice as she is, she has the title of \"Spindrift Knight,\" a name that leads many who hear it to assume that she manipulates Hydro instead of Cryo.\nThere is a story behind that misunderstanding — the story of a habit.\nEula carries an exquisitely crafted bone whistle with her at all times. Each time she blows it, the vivid sound of ocean waves rings out loud and clear, far and wide.\nSince the area her company is in charge of borders the sea, reproducing the sound of waves can be an excellent means of disturbing the enemy's judgment, or of deceiving less intelligent monsters into believing that a tsunami is inbound, causing them to flee in panic.\nUsing this unique combat tactic has helped Eula emerge victorious against larger forces than her own on numerous occasions, and has also earned her the moniker of \"Spindrift Knight.\"\nOf course, a bone whistle is capable of imitating many other sounds, and Eula has her reasons for imitating the ocean waves.\nIt would seem that something akin to the \"Glacier Knight\" should suit her better.\nBut perhaps Eula herself prefers the rolling waves to the cold and unyielding ice...\nRoaming freely across the world, gentle but firm with the reefs and sands in their dominion...\nYes, she yearns not to be sharp and rigid like ice, but to be free and unbound like the ocean spray.",
            "Vision\tWhere do \"grievances\" come from?\nDire straits in the present? Or the misfortunes of the past?\nAnd what does \"vengeance\" mean?\nTo right wrongs and rebalance the scales of justice in one's favor? Or to drive one's foes into a pit of agony?\n\"Restore the clan's former glory, win the respect of the common folk, stand once more at the apex of rulership\"... These things were utterly unimportant to Eula.\nShe had never experienced the great humiliation of her clan — and all the torment she had endured in life had been at their own hands. She attempted to free herself from their shackles, yet struggled to obtain recognition from the outside world.\nHer talk of grievances and vengeance was but a habit, a signal, a shield.\nFor someone in her unique circumstances and position, what remarks should she just laugh off, and what ideas should she hold onto?\nHow should she fight this battle to break free, once and for all, from the great burden of her bloodline?\nIt was with all these questions and more circling around in her mind that Eula came under the tutelage of a long-forgotten old outrider. From him, she learned an open-mindedness and down-to-earth persistence that she had never previously encountered.\nBefore grappling with grievances and vengeance, before questions of clan and outsider, she first had to discover herself.\nHer survival mechanism... her means of self-preservation... her grit and determination...\nShe may articulate it in terms of \"grievances\" and \"vengeance,\" but nothing can change what it is at its core: something both strong and kind.\nEula finally found herself on a gentle path of revenge that was hers alone... and the moment she set foot on that path, there it appeared before her — her Vision."

            "Character Details\tIf you were to open any Kshahrewar textbook, you will find Faruzan's record penned proudly upon the author page.\n\"Faruzan, outstanding researcher of the Akademiya, winner of the Sumeru Puzzlers' League Lifetime Achievement Award, one of the seminal scholars of Ancient Mechanics.\"\nBut if you were to talk to Haravatat students about their choices, they frown as they speak of Faruzan's current state.\n\"Oh, you mean her... Well, her research is... obsolete, and there's no way it'll pass review, so you might as well find another mentor.\"\nSuch reviews, as disparate as heaven and earth, arouse one's curiosity as a matter of course.\nAnd when asked by her juniors, Madam Faruzan often wears an inscrutable look.\n\"Hmm? You mean to ask what happened these past hundred years? And how things came to this pass? Ah, but this is a secret most great. Come closer, and I shall tell you. Yes, yes, closer...\"\n—And then she gives them a good conk on the head.\n\"First! That curiosity of yours is best served in your studies. And secondly! You shall remember to call me 'Madam'!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tFor many researchers at the Akademiya, Faruzan, who has been one of their number since a century prior, has always been a legendary figure.\nIn her brief academic career, she was able to analyze over half the ruins within Sumeru's borders, thereby greatly lowering the difficulty of various further analyses into them and their machinery.\nThe manuscripts and theses she left behind have laid firm foundations for all researchers who would come after, lighting the way for the countless Kshahrewar researchers' pursuit of knowledge.\nHer \"end\" would also add several layers of mystique to her legendary life, for she would disappear under mysterious circumstances while exploring some ruins, and would never be heard from again.\nEach retelling of her tale would grow ever more mysterious with regard to her disappearance.\nSome claim that she came into contact with King Deshret's ancient knowledge and was secretly imprisoned within the Temple of Silence.\nOthers said that her intellect that had been acknowledged by the gods, and that she had been brought up to the heavens to dwell with them.\nAfter all, people generally believed that a legendary figure should have an equally legendary end.\nThus did the tale drift further and further from the truth.\n\"So I made a miscalculation while solving a puzzle, and got trapped in the ruins. What? Is there a rule that says that senior researchers aren't allowed to mess up?\"",
            "Character Story 2\tWhat may come as a surprise to many younger researchers is that though Faruzan has made great contributions to the study of mechanics, she is in fact a member of Haravatat, which specializes in the study of languages.\nSimply put, her field of study is \"the analysis of the structure of and solutions to various ruin devices via the study of stone carvings and other ancient texts.\"\nA century ago, the Akademiya's studies into Ancient Mechanics were not yet mature. As such, Faruzan's ability to prejudge the operations of such machines was indeed of great benefit to the act of exploring ruins.\nHowever, as the number of as-yet-unexplored ruins grew fewer and fewer, and the Kshahrewar's understanding of mechanics grew more advanced, this field of research would slowly lose the luster of yesteryear.\nBy the time Faruzan re-entered the Akademiya a century later, no student in Haravatat could even understand her essays, and the mentors could only look at each other in dismay at the topics she would submit for study.\nOn the other hand, there are many students in Kshahwerar who, having graduated on the back of manuscripts she had written and hearing of her present plight, have come to persuade her to join their Darshan instead, only to see little success in that matter.\nA certain researcher even went a bridge too far in their persuasion, making such claims as \"in the future, Kshahrewar will be the only Darshan that can do research into machines!\" and \"the era of interpreting ancient texts is over!\" This person wound up being chastised by an irate Faruzan for as long as it would take to sit through two entire classes.\nThey say that that evening, this poor researcher would be nursing some alcohol in Lambad's Tavern, aghast and humbled in equal measure.\nA friend of his from Haravatat spent the whole night consoling him, while plotting in his heart to debate this old fogey and show her what for.\nAlas, Lambad's Tavern would have a new inconsolable drunk the very next day.",
            "Character Story 3\tApart from having her topics rejected during review, Faruzan's other major headache is finding a student after her own heart.\nEach time she plans a lecture at Haravatat, the students in the audience either scratch their heads or struggle not to fall asleep as they are subjected to a veritable barrage of mechanics jargon.\nIn a fury, Faruzan will hurl her pointer and begin lambasting her old colleagues in Haravatat for failing in their duties as teachers and training such a generation of juniors.\nHer fury only grows when she realizes that the students pay more attention to her criticisms of folk from the previous century than her explanations of the principles of mechanics.\nAnd when students who have a mind to study mechanics hear that Madam Faruzan would like them to join her, they often express gratitude initially, only to waffle and claim that they must reconsider when they realize, conflict clear on their faces, that it is Haravatat to which they must go.\nOf course, Faruzan never hears these \"considerations\" — the next time they meet, that student will have already joined Kshahrewar.\nBut there was once, when Faruzan had accepted Tighnari's invitation to investigate some rainforest ruins, when she happened upon the humblest of prayers as she walked: \"Oh, great Dendro Archon, please help me learn words faster!\"\nThose words were spoken sadly yet earnestly, and even Faruzan was moved: To think that Sumeru still played host to people with such a passion for the written word!\nThat voice did not seem to belong to a child who had yet to read or write, nor did it sound like a researcher of Satyavada Life. And yet this must have been a person of some skill, for normal folk would not be able to delve this deep into the forest alone. Perhaps this person might even have some experience in dealing with machines in the forest.\nFollowing a brief moment of consideration, Faruzan concluded that this was a student of suitable age, fitting direction, and excellent quality — someone worth taking on as a disciple for sure. So decided, she revealed her presence from behind a tree.\nHaving thought that there was no one about, Collei squeaked in surprise, the sound echoing through the woods.\nTighnari was quick to the rescue, however, and following a stammering explanation from Collei (supplemented with interjections from Tighnari), this most major of misunderstandings was cleared up.\nWith time, Faruzan would reacquaint herself with this young trainee Forest Ranger and get to know her better, even bringing her delicious food every time she visits Gandharva Ville.\nHowever, Collei has realized, to her consternation, that the resolution of the misunderstanding has only made Madam Faruzan... more eager to take her on as a student.\nSurely there must be lots of Akademiya students who \"respect their teachers and their teachings\" and \"devote themselves to diligence,\" no?\nPerhaps even Faruzan has not realized that there is one other thing about Collei that has attracted her attention:\nThat despite having experienced inhuman suffering, she has nonetheless been able to gain the strength to face life.",
            "Character Story 4\tEven Faruzan herself cannot speak very articulately about the century in which she was trapped within the ruins, for her memories of it are very foggy.\nThe ruins' origin? Unknown. Its location? Unknown. All she remembers is that it was related to King Deshret's civilization and filled from wall to wall with mechanisms and secret inscriptions.\nThe mysterious power within the ruins had kept her body in a state of stasis, knowing neither hunger nor physical fatigue, yet not wholly able to shake off mental wear.\nShe expended all the writing material she had on hand, yet could not translate a single line of text; used up a lifetime's worth of knowledge, yet could not unlock a single device.\nLying amidst a mountain of manuscript paper, she stared blankly at the cipher-text on the ceiling.\nThey mocked her, these legacies of an ancient deity — scorned her ignorance and the pettiness of the modern person.\nDid all she had studied and prided herself upon, did the painstaking research done by generations of scholars truly matter so little in the face of this ancient civilization?\nFaruzan got up from the ground, picked up a piece of smashed stone, and continued carving upon the tiles.\nAs long as there was life, there was hope. What was unknown today could be learned tomorrow. Civilizations that existed could continue to evolve. Solutions unreached by the people of today would be uncovered by those who would come after.\nEven if this was to be her grave, she would leave some deductions and trial-and-error records behind to grant the next unfortunate, trapped soul some chance of escape.\nThis was the spirit of scholarship — this was why researchers existed in the first place.\nAfter who knows how long, the entire floor, as far as she could touch it, had been filled with the symbols of obscure deductions.\nAfter that indeterminate time, her memories began to grow fuzzy and her consciousness faded, and she began to mutter words none could comprehend.\nAnd at one point — she knew not when — she finally found a way to solve the enigma.\nIn her addled state, she did not yet realize that the true struggle still awaited her, beyond the walls of those ruins.",
            "Character Story 5\tFaruzan would have to recuperate for quite some time after her escape to regain consciousness.\nSeeing Sumeru vastly changed from what she remembered, Faruzan almost believed that she was still within the ruins, trapped in some kind of illusion-generated device.\nIt was not until someone from the Akademiya came to confirm her identity using past records within Akasha and explained the changes the world had undergone during this time that Faruzan began to slowly accept that time had indeed passed.\nThat researcher brought her a Kshahrewar book, and as she cracked it open, she found this written on the title page:\n\"Much of the content in this book came from Madam Faruzan's treatises and manuscripts. We hope that her name will still be remembered by future generations of students when she returns.\"\nAs Faruzan read this text, organized by old friends of hers, she felt as if she could almost see her classmates again, talking and chatting about their futures. Yet this was already something from a century ago.\nThe people she knew, the people who knew her... they were all no longer here.\nShe had returned to Sumeru indeed, but it was as if she had drifted to some strange land instead.\nEven wayfarers adrift may return to their home, but she had been left unmoored on time's ocean, and there was no returning to the past.\nThe poor researcher at her side was trying to pick and choose their words such that they might inquire as to what had happened to this senior from times past without touching any sore spots.\nFaruzan closed her book in silence before speaking of those past events in an even tone.\n\"—It was just a failed experiment. Such things happen to us researchers, don't they?\"\nNo matter the location, situation, or generation, time would never stop for Faruzan again.",
            "Vairambhaka Gear\tThis multi-purpose ruin exploration auxiliary support terminal, code-named \"Vairambhaka,\" is one of the few projects that Faruzan was able to successfully secure funding for from the Akademiya following her return.\nThis device can perform escort, monster dispersal, sand-clearing, and various other tasks. As per her usual preferences, it also contains various components that can be pressed interactively to relieve boredom.\nUnexpectedly, this travel essential actually wound up attracting the attention of a group of matra. They barged into her workshop without explanation and began to look the Vairambhaka up and down.\nUpon discovering its many seemingly useless components, their suspicions were aroused further, and ignoring Faruzan's protests that they \"were just for stress relief,\" they planned on taking her latest work apart to examine it carefully.\nFortunately, the General Mahamatra, Cyno, arrived in time to stop them.\nAs it turned out, they suspected that Faruzan had been reticent about her mysterious disappearance on account of some nefarious secret.\nThey also believed that she had refused to join Kshahrewar so that she could use Haravatat's lack of expertise in mechanics to build something dangerous.\nAfter all, few are the researchers who have not been seduced by the ominous knowledge that King Deshret's civilization had gained access to. As such, they came flocking the moment they heard that Faruzan was making some machine, as if to fight some terrible foe.\nCyno, armed with records related with Faruzan, was able to dispel their doubts one by one, before apologizing to Faruzan for his subordinates' trespass, leaving one of them to help clear up the mess.\nFaruzan, who was just suffering from a lack of manpower right at that moment, was quite satisfied indeed with that arrangement. Quite liking this General Mahamatra's style, she invited Cyno to give this new machine a name.\nCyno thought for a moment before saying that since it could stir up strong winds and had a connection with the matra, she could call it the \"Great Vayuvyastra.\"\nFaruzan's puzzlement at that could easily rival that which she had shown in the ruins belonging to King Deshret.\nFortunately, one of the matra came to her rescue, mentioning that Kshahrewar already possessed a machine with the same name, thus saving them all what would come if she were to inquire about the \"deeper meaning\" behind such a name.\nLater, having done her own independent study into how that name was formed, Faruzan would come up with her own name for her newest work — and thus, the Vairambhaka Gear was born.",
            "Vision\tAlthough she has forgotten how she solved that puzzle, Faruzan does have some vague impression about what happened to her as she left the ruins.\nThe first thing she felt was light, stinging her eyes till they shut and causing her to stagger back a little.\nIt was then followed by wind, whipping about her face and flowing across her shoulders like a searing, welcoming kiss.\nHer eyes were closed, and yet she felt that she could see everything, and following the wind she took one step, and then another, toward newfound freedom after a century of being lost.\nSuch a long period of time would have changed the environment and eroded her memory, and she might have failed to find the way home.\nYet she followed the wind's guidance even in her semi-conscious state, and it led her swaying through the wilds, avoiding monsters and hazardous areas alike, until she was assaulted by a familiar yet foreign sensation.\nAs she collapsed, her stomach began to grumble.\n\"Ah... Is that hunger? It's been a while, hasn't it...\"\nShe had solved the machine, escaped the ruins, but at the end, she had forgotten the most primal of needs!\nThe wind died down, and unable to continue on, Faruzan collapsed, falling into a deep sleep.\"\n...\nA sudden wind whipped about a merchant caravan traversing the lands at a leisurely pace, getting into one Sumpter Beast's eyes, causing it to turn away and stop advancing.\nThe merchant was about to pull it back into line, only to notice something glittering in the distance.\n\"Hey, keep up with the group! What are you looking at, anyway? Treasure?\"\n\"No, wait... That looks like a person over there, lying on the ground!\"\nAnd in the distance, a Vision shone brightly at the side of an unconscious Faruzan."

            "Character Details\tFischl is the Prinzessin der Verurteilung who arrived here after being exiled from the otherworld, \"Immernachtreich.\"\nShe \"observes and weaves the threads of fate\" together with her talking night raven familiar, Oz.\nOwing to reasons she cannot and Oz will not explain, Fischl now serves the Adventurers' Guild as an investigator.",
            "Character Story 1\tAs an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild, the single biggest advantage Fischl has over her peers is Oz.\n\"Milady, please stop sending me out to spy on Stormterror. That chap could eat me for breakfast! Well, I'm so puny I probably wouldn't even get caught between his teeth, but... Anyway, I don't want to die!\"\n\"Hmph! You are supposed to be my familiar. Not everyone gets to be the Prinzessin der Verurteilung's familiar, do you understand? Consider it your honor to dedicate your life to serving me!\"\nFischl is able to see through Oz's eyes. Whenever she wants to, she possesses Oz and looks down upon the earth from the sky.\nWhether she wants to inspect the flora on the Stormbearer Mountains or observe a disturbance in Wolvendom, through Oz she can see anything and everything.\nThanks largely to her unique ability — and, to a lesser extent, to her own effort and peculiar personality — Fischl quickly went from the rookie investigator of the Adventurers' Guild to a respected rising star of the organization.\nShe's certainly done well for herself. She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the guild master.\nThen again, would they really have had to do much persuading? If she's the Prinzessin der Verurteilung... one can only assume that would make them the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung.",
            "Character Story 2\tIt's said that there is currently a \"Fischl Dictionary\" in circulation among the adventurers.\nNamely, a book that aims to translate Fischl's peculiar way of speaking into something more understandable.\nFor example:\n\"I hear... echoing in the abyss of time, the burning winds of the old, all of which shape the spire forgotten in the torrents of karma\" would translate into \"Stormterror's Lair\";\n\"Servants of the Verurteilung name! As you have requested, prepare to receive the great wisdom of the prinzessin\" would be \"I'll look into that and let you know ASAP\";\n\"Rejoice! O, ye servants who long for the blessing of the prinzessin; venture now deep into the battlefield with hearts of the tiger\" means that the initial investigative work has been completed;\n\"All has been written in this tome of dark prophecies\" simply means that her journal has been updated with the latest reports.\nHowever, the \"Fischl Dictionary\" is actually just an in-joke, not a real book.\nThose who are familiar with Fischl concentrate on what she means to say, not the way in which she says it; she notices this and takes it as a sign of true respect.\n\"Aha! So you do understand. Then fate does indeed bring kindred spirits together.\"\nThose who manage to adopt her speech mannerisms when they respond to her will find she is both delighted and bashful, and praises their language-learning ability.\n\"A prinzessin should always give praise where praise is due... Now, let us converse some more. Do not be mistaken; these are to be the foundations of the new world...\"",
            "Character Story 3\tOz and Princess Fischl are not only close friends but also servant and master, with a shared soul and fate.\nTheir first encounter was mentioned in \"Flowers for Princess Fischl (I): End Time Zersetzung\"\nWhen the lone pilgrimaging princess reached the kingdom of eternal twilight, the fate-resisting royals chose to deny everything in their desperation.\nThey refused to recognize Fischl's noble stature and mission as the princess of the Immernachtreich; denied their 13,000-year lineage as a branch of the royal family; and forsook their own nobility and restraints as humans... devolving into clumsy and vicious beasts.\nIn the palace of Twilight and amidst the teeth of the beasts, the princess shed her sacred blood on the ancient emblem.\nAt the moment of her peril, the dark wings of the night ripped the trapped, wounded princess from her despair and took her under its wings.\nFollowing the scent of her noble blood, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, the King of Ravens came to the princess and pledged his eternal loyalty.",
            "Character Story 4\tThere is a story that goes as follows. A long time ago in a place far, far away, there was a tiny little girl.\nThe girl's parents were busy adventurers. She spent most of her childhood in the library, traversing the countless universes that were contained in the pages of the library books.\nShe became the ruler of the Immernachtreich, summoned Thundering Retribution as a royal princess, and formed a soul bond with a Raven...\n...\n\"███, what books did you read today?\" Her parents asked her on one of the rare occasions that they were home between adventures.\nShe proceeded to tell them the story she had read from her favorite series.\n\"...And then he said, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, you are the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.'\"\n\"Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, ███, how about I call you \"Fischl\" too?\" Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her.\n\"Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.\"\nThese kind and loving words lit up her world.\nHowever, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting.\nUnable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself:\n\"I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess. It's true, because Mommy and Daddy said so...\"\n\"Never will I surrender my nobility and dreams, for they are... a princess' rite of passage.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tJust like in the universe of \"Flowers for Princess Fischl,\" entropy begot destruction.\nIn other words: The girl who loved to dream grew up.\nOn her fourteenth birthday, those of her peers who refused to accommodate her quirks belittled her once again.\n\"This is but a minor setback for the noble princess. My parents will understand,\" she thought to herself.\nFor if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams.\nBut when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation.\n\"███, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you...\"\nAnd with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart.\nThat day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well. She had a strange feeling that she was being watched... Suddenly, she heard an otherworldly flapping of wings.\nSure enough, she looked up and her red, swollen eyes met with those of a night raven from another world.\nWhat transpired afterwards is another story...\nFischl doesn't much like this story. Thinking about it causes her to feel suffocating pain and soul-devouring loneliness.\nMaybe one day, this story will be written. But that would be ███'s story, not Fischl's.\nFischl has but one identity: she's the Prinzessin.\nAs long as she remembers this simple and perfect logic, with a little bit of nobility and a touch of kindness from others, nothing can ever hurt her.\nThings are looking up for Prinzessin Fischl these days — not only does she have Oz, but she has finally met a traveler who, just like her, comes from a different world...",
            "Flowers for Princess Fischl: Phantasmagoria\tThe novel series \"Flowers for Princess Fischl\" is available as a collectible set.\nDue to the tiny numbers in circulation, it is a priceless commodity amongst loyal fans of the author.\nBut no matter how elegant these works are aesthetically, their worldview remains incredibly bleak:\nEvery good, bright and noble thing must eventually fall to inexorable entropic destruction, and the final destination of the universe is the realm-in-waiting of the Prinzessin, Immernachtreich.\nThis is the fate of all worlds, of the universe, and all who live in it.\nAnd the Prinzessin and her loyal companion, the \"Night-Severing Raven Oz,\" Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, are the World Beasts who will swallow all dreams.\nAt the very end, at the end of karma itself, she will grant all the gathered souls her benediction, and use her Thundering Retribution to cleanse all that is ugly and wicked.\nThe Prinzessin will then set her own heart ablaze, and the universe shall be born anew in its immortal light.\nBut before all this can come to pass, the Prinzessin must first roam many universes, and see countless new sights.\nThus it is perfectly within the spirit of the original work that the Prinzessin should be stuck as an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild in a slightly backward world. Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.\nThe Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.\nAfter all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these.",
            "Vision\tSo, is Oz just an imaginary friend who only exists as a figment of Fischl's subconscious?\nOur story begins with the royal heirloom, Edelstein der Dunkelheit — that is to say, Fischl's Vision.\nWhen her wish was acknowledged, the raven Oz and her Vision both appeared before her eyes.\nThat night, at dinner, Oz got on most well with Fischl's parents:\n\"Ah, mein Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung, forgive mine overstep, but the beans in your house are too delicious.\"\n\"Oh, then please, help yourself. This is the first time little ███ has met a friend she can bring over for dinner since she turned fourteen. This is a special occasion.\"\n\"W—What are you saying! I... One does not simply cavort with the plebeians!\"\n—And that's what happened.\nFor all intents and purposes, it seems that the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung could both see Oz, and both believed Oz to be the Prinzessin's first friend.\nAs for the \"Adventurer Who Bears the World's Curses,\" the \"Visitor From Outer Worlds\" and the \"Strange Fae-shaped Emergency Sustenance...\"\nThey would become the Prinzessin's new friends, though that would happen even further in the future."

            "Character Details\tThough many in Liyue are fascinated by life in Yujing Terrace, its day-to-day operations and rules are a mystery to them.\nThey are aware that the Liyue Qixing are the cream of the crop who hold the fate of the city in their hands, but the calculations and data behind the Qixing's every decision are far harder to grasp.\nThe people understand that the new policies announced each year will change the dynamics of the market, yet none can comprehend how policy is plucked from complex meeting minutes and compiled into something easier on the human eye.\nAs the secretary of Yuehai Pavilion, Ganyu undertakes many tasks that ordinary folk do not see.\nFor those that have witnessed her standing by the dock at daybreak, enjoying her breakfast in silence, it is difficult to imagine her in such a post.\nEven still, by the time the sun has fully risen, she will have returned to Yuehai Pavilion overlooking Yujing Terrace, to continue to fulfill her contract.\nA contract that she signed three thousand years ago with Rex Lapis.",
            "Character Story 1\tGanyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. \"What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished.\"",
            "Character Story 2\t\"I work for the well-being of all living things in Liyue.\"\nUnder almost all circumstances, Ganyu is a very trustworthy secretary.\nIt is hard to imagine anyone outperforming her in the face of such an enormous workload, especially given her unique and penetrating insights into all of Liyue's matters.\nNevertheless, her reliability can only be guaranteed under \"almost all circumstances.\"\nThe more important the matter, the more Ganyu strives for perfection, and the more nervous she becomes. Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.\nOne such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.\nGanyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.\nLater on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.\nHer colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.\nThose who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.\nThose closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused.\n\"I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite...\"\nNeedless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!",
            "Character Story 3\tHow long is a thousand years?\nLong enough for the Glaze Lilies that once teemed throughout Dihua Marsh to be wiped out by floodwaters, and long enough for the thriving settlement that sprung up upon Guili Plains to come to ruin in war.\nHow short is a thousand years?\nTo Ganyu, it has felt shorter than the blink of an eye.\nThroughout a passage of time unimaginable to mortals, Ganyu has been working on all manner of things at Yujing Terrace.\nShe recorded the raising and demolishing of every building, and witnessed the rise to prosperity of every industry.\nGanyu's sense of objectivity towards the passage of time comes from the endless reams of data she must trawl through, and from the ever-increasing number of colors she finds that she needs to categorize it all.\nAll this time, her mindset has never changed — she constantly wavers between her human and adeptus halves.\nOn one hand, Ganyu the qilin finds it difficult to comprehend mortal squabbles.\nBut on the other hand, her human blood reminds her always to hold out hope that she might someday be able to fit in.",
            "Character Story 4\tOutside the confines of her work, Ganyu very quickly shows how different she is from most other people.\nShe has a habit of taking afternoon naps and has a shockingly accurate internal clock. When lunch hour arrives, no matter where she is, she will simply curl up into a ball and fall asleep on the spot. Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.\nThese habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.\nBut once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.\nUnable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.\nAfter receiving a stern admonishment to \"only take afternoon naps where it's safe,\" Ganyu retorted:\n\"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?\"\nPerhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans.",
            "Character Story 5\tGanyu's qilin heritage is little-known in Liyue Harbor.\nWhenever she is asked by someone walking along Feiyun Slope as to the obvious protrusions in her hair, she says that they are ornamental heirlooms.\n\"If I told them the truth, they would distance themselves from me...\"\nDespite never having been on particularly close terms with Liyue's citizens in the first place, Ganyu would still not consider distancing to be a good thing.\nHer more important reason for hiding the truth is to prevent curious onlookers from touching her qilin horns.\nAfter all, a qilin's horns are a sensitive part of their body, both physically and mentally speaking.\nAnother secret that Ganyu is anxious to keep hidden is the fact that she is watching her physique.\nThe qilin are strict vegetarians, but Liyue is a veritable powerhouse of gastronomical delights, one in which even vegetarians struggle to control their appetites.\nGanyu, who has grown accustomed to city life, is thus very vigilant in matters concerning her weight and physique.\nWhenever she finds herself being drawn towards some delicious dish, she will attempt to reassert her self-control. For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.\nBut she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.\nDuring the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.\nFor Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must.",
            "The Flora of Yujing Terrace\tHandwritten notes detail the morphological features and behaviors of the plants in Yujing Terrace, with each beautiful stroke penned by Ganyu's own hand.\nThe notes are succinct, comprehensive, and well-categorized, and even offer some insights that one would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere on the market.\nThese include pointers on caring for Glaze Lilies and methods for grafting Silk Flowers.\nIn readability and scientific accessibility, they come close to the standard of official publications.\nOr rather, this is the experience if one starts reading from the front.\nSkip to near the end, however, and one may well be left dumbfounded.\nThe final few pages are a shocking rash of black ink and frantically scribbled-out text.\nReading patiently and painstakingly between the lines, one might just discover that these notes were, at one time, various methods for vegetable cultivation.\n\"But if I learn to grow vegetables, I'll be even less able to control my appetite.\"\nHer hands balling into fists, it was with much difficulty that Ganyu erased the results of her research.\nLater, whilst watering the plants on an empty stomach, Ganyu found herself plunging her head into a thicket of Silk Flowers, fantasizing that they were Sweet Flowers in an effort to comfort herself.\nMany more fantasy Sweet Flowers followed shortly afterward during her afternoon nap...",
            "Vision\tQilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty."

            "About Gorou: Advice\tThe troops seem to picture me as someone of extraordinary abilities — I think it might be because of our streak of victories lately. Now they always come to me for advice on even the most trivial matters.

I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her.",
            "About Sayu\tHmm, according to our intel, she is a ninja proficient in the art of infiltration — a skill set which could prove very useful in some of Her Excellency's special operations...

Oh, well forget it then.",

            "More About Gorou: II\tI may not have superior cunning or intelligence, but what I do have is my own two hands and my life to lay on the line. Countless battles in, I'm still here, so I guess these hands and my will to survive were both strong enough to see me through. Some even say that no matter how dire the battle may be, everyone will emerge unscathed as long as they follow me. And with that, I've somehow gained enough reputation among our forces to become the leader that I am now.",
            "More About Gorou: III\tAt first, our only enemies were roaming bandits, pirates, and monsters. But then, everything changed when the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree. The Shogun's Army marched up expecting to put us in our place, but we were ready for them, and we hit them hard. Hehe, I bet they never expected to meet such fierce resistance.",
            "More About Gorou: IV\tHer Excellency once warned me of my fatal flaw... I tend to get too engrossed in battle, fighting deep into enemy lines and forgetting about everything else. She told me that my bravery is commendable, but as a ranking officer, it's not my place to do this. I'm doing my best to improve, but... Would you also be able to keep an eye on me?",
            "More About Gorou: V\tWe are not fighting against any particular group or faction. No, we fight against a destructive malice — a malice that has trampled the aspirations of the people and destroyed the peaceful lives they once knew. After I rid the land of such evil I will be able to peacefully lay down my weapon. Only then will I trade my uniform for civilian attire... and finally stroll the beautiful landscape of Watatsumi Island together with you.",
            "Gorou's Hobbies\tI love mountain climbing! The steeper, the better. Climbing trains my body and mind, making me stronger with every grip and every foothold. Better yet is climbing mountains with fellow companions. After hours of dirt and sweat scaling the summit, we can sit down and enjoy the view together. It's one of life's greatest joys! Ahem, however, I have absolutely no desire to scale the tallest peak in Inazuma...",

It's probably the most precious commodity of all. Ah, what can I say — I guess I just have a sweet tooth!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI'll pretty much eat anything, but onions are an exception.

            "Character Details\tGorou is the great general of Watatsumi Island's military, and he is deeply loved by his subordinates.\nDuring the period of the Vision Hunt Decree, Gorou led the forces of Watatsumi against the Shogun's Army, and successfully held the line against them.\nThe troops call him the \"ever-victorious pointy-eared general,\" a nickname that has also seen broad use among Shogunate warriors.\nIn private, however, Gorou puts on no airs and is a straightforward person, which has led him to be regarded by all as the man with the plan.\nBut even such an exemplary general must have his fair share of troubles...",
            "Character Story 1\tGorou was once an ordinary Watatsumi soldier.\nDuring a certain special operation, Gorou's unit, Gorgasia II, faced an unprecedented crisis.\nTheir captain had been felled by a stray arrow, and the survivors were surrounded deep in the mountains.\nTo continue their mission, to ask for reinforcements, to open negotiations with the enemy... Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.\nLeaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.\nAt this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.\nThey would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.\nWhen asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:\n\"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got.\"\n\"I'll take responsibility if the plan fails.\"\nAfter holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by Sangonomiya Kokomi herself.\nAfter that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General.",
            "Character Story 2\tIn the eyes of the men, Gorou is a strict but humble general.\nHe is straightforward and easy-going, and he treats his subordinates like his own family, sharing weal and woe with them.\nSangonomiya Kokomi once told Gorou that materiel, supplies, and salaries were the three most important things to an army.\nFrom that day on, he would personally explain weapon maintenance to his subordinates. Every time the granaries were opened, he would supervise the process strictly to prevent any unlawful deductions.\nAnd as General Gorou, he will always lead from the front.\nThe sight of him charging at the tip of the spear is like a rallying banner, encouraging the troops behind him to continue advancing.\nThese are all reasons why the troops greatly respect him. As with Kokomi, Gorou greatly treasures the lives of his troops, but by contrast, values his own quite little.\nSome who understand little of the thought process behind this occasionally joke that Gorou is a \"kid\" who doesn't seem like a general at all.\nBut to the soldiers of Watatsumi Island, this kid is the best general they could ask for.",
            "Character Story 3\tGorou is valiant and decisive, often leading inferior forces to victory over superior opposition.\nHowever, he does have a shortcoming of his own — a sometimes unstable temper.\nThat is to say that the blood sometimes rushes to his head at the height of a battle.\nWar is cruel, and Gorou does indeed lack experience compared to veterans who have been scrapping it out on battlefields for decades.\nFortunately, he learns fast and is currently trying to make up for his various small failings.\nSangonomiya Kokomi often provides her various commanders with directives, but how they are used is up to the skill of the commander in question.\nFor his part, Gorou is always able to execute the courses of action that best suit the present situation from the directives he has been given.\nGorou believes that over time, he will come to internalize the concepts behind them. Perhaps then, he can take the field with even more confidence than before.",
            "Character Story 4\tAt Yae Miko's request, Gorou has taken up a certain extra \"job\" at Yae Publishing House.\nWith the end of the Vision Hunt Decree, and the successful negotiations between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, relations between the two sides are beginning to warm.\nGorou has also visited Narukami Island quite a few times to check out the changes, buy a few popular books, and go to Yae Publishing House to complete the task he agreed to help with.\nYae Miko set up an anonymous column for Gorou in the \"That's Life\" magazine. Here, readers will write about the things that trouble them and send them to Yae Publishing House, upon which Gorou will give them some suggestions.\nYae Publishing House will take special care to redact any personal information revealed on the part of the write-ins or Gorou's replies, and will replace real names with pseudonyms.\nAccording to Yae Miko, she chose him because she'd heard that he often listened to his subordinates when they chatted about personal matters.\nThe column proved to be very popular indeed, but for whatever reason, every time an editor delivers the royalties to Gorou, they might sheepishly ask:\n\"Ah, speaking of which, Gorou, have you heard of Ms. Hina?\"\n\"I've heard that she's a rather popular columnist, and a recent one, too. Is something the matter?\"\n\"Oh, no, no... It's nothing...\"",
            "Character Story 5\tJust as the troops don't exactly tell Gorou everything happening in their lives, Gorou, too, has some troubles that are difficult to share.\nFor example, how his tail fur starts to get dull and look haggard after being exposed to the elements for too long, and how he'd love to tend to it — if he could only spare the time out in the field.\nOr how he sometimes feels a bit inferior about his slight physique when bathing together with his subordinates.\nOr about how encountering inscrutable women like Yae Miko sends him into defense mode instantly, rendering him unable to properly interact with them...\nIn trying to maintain a respectable image, Gorou refrains from telling his soldiers about such troubles.\nAnd while they have been able to guess at his troubles to some extent, the Watatsumi soldiers often just play along and pretend that they don't notice.\nAs such, his worries just kept piling up, until the Traveler arrived, thus granting the Watatsumi general, ever good at banishing the worries of others, someone who could help relieve him of his own woes.",
            "Mountaineering Gear\tOf Gorou's various hobbies, \"mountaineering\" is likely up there in the top three.\nSweating it out while climbing a mountain with companions before admiring the beauty all around you helps to train both the mind and body and is a great camaraderie-builder.\nTo better enjoy this hobby of his, Gorou bought a set of mountaineering gear from a traveling merchant.\nThe set is not particularly pricey, but it is both sturdy and durable and has seen Gorou through many dangerous ascents.\nJust as he maintains his weapons well, Gorou has also kept this set of gear in tip-top shape. There is little doubt that it will accompany him through many future journeys as well.",
            "Vision\tThere was a time when Gorou ascribed responsibility for victory or loss in battle entirely to himself.\n\"If only I became a little stronger, perhaps I'd be able to turn the tide.\"\nIt was in this spirit that Gorou trained his archery day and night, hoping to rely on his strength to lead his comrades to victory.\nBut after some time on the battlefield, Gorou saw powerful warriors being isolated and captured alive, while weak troops in inferior positions could rout their enemies through unity.\nThat was when Gorou realized that a single person's battlefield capabilities are limited.\nGetting stronger is important, naturally, but uniting the troops to fight as one is even more crucial.\nA troop can only be unbeatable if they are strong together.\nHaving realized this, Gorou no longer pursued the apex of excellence in archery, but instead invested time and effort in those around him, helping everyone improve together.\nThinking back on it, this may have opened the door for Gorou to obtain his Vision."

            "Character Details\tThe 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a young lady managing the parlor's operations. Despite her position, she's an amiable person who puts on no airs.\nHer antics are as plentiful as the sand on Yaoguang Shoal. She never ceases to shock people with her countless bizarre ideas.\nHu Tao may seem like all play and no work, spending every free moment on leisure and being widely considered a laissez-faire business owner.\nIt is only during funeral ceremonies, when she personally leads her undertakers through lamp-lit alleys, that she shows her dignified and solemn side.",
            "Character Story 1\tFuneral ceremonies allow mortals to leave this world with dignity.\nAnd Liyue's Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is said to be painting the last strokes on the scrolls of people's lives in the most respectful way.\nTraditional funerals include multiple steps such as holding a wake, burial, putting up a memorial plaque... All of which are subject to strict rules.\nRegardless of their social standing and level of wealth, all who depart deserve a ceremony that would do them honor. This is the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's client service philosophy.\nOne would think that such a reputable organization ought to be led only by an individual of utmost learning and sagacity.\nYet the heavy mantle of the 77th Director has fallen on the shoulders of a young lady like Hu Tao.\nShe has got quite a reputation in Liyue. Whenever someone mentions Hu Tao, their neighbors find it extremely hard to navigate the conversation.\nAlthough she is widely praised for her wit and shrewdness, her eccentric notions are not as welcome, as she often lets her imagination run wild.\nAs a three-year-old, she would read through volumes of classic texts while doing handstands. At six, she would cut classes and fall asleep in coffins. When she was eight, she started living in the parlor and learning the etiquette of funeral ceremonies...\nOne would never use the word \"measured\" to describe her behavior.\nDuring her teenage years, Hu Tao was tasked with conducting a funeral ceremony for the first time.\nThe parlor's undertakers and consultants were anticipating her debut with their stomachs in knots as if they were suspended over the peaks of Jueyun Karst.",
            "Character Story 2\tFortunately, Hu Tao treats the parlor's operations with the utmost importance and is always looking to grow her business.\n\"At the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, the living give us Mora to see the dead on their way. We have a responsibility to both parties, so we gotta make sure both sides are happy.\"\nWhen it comes to the parlor's rules, Hu Tao knows them all like the back of her hand.\nEach day when the parlor closes its doors, Hu Tao invites consultants from different walks of life to pass their teachings on to the undertakers.\n\"The funeral tradition is like science. It cannot be performed based on impressions and personal habits.\"\nOf all the lecturers, Zhongli is the most revered one. As such, his lessons have proven to be the most effective in cultivating the competence of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's undertakers.\nDespite often being teased by Hu Tao due to his old-fashioned style, he is also the person that she trusts the most.\nApart from that, Hu Tao always instructs her undertakers to respect their clients' wishes and not insist on any particular form of funeral.\n\"Some clients want nothing more than a peaceful ceremony, some opt for a more lively style of event. There are also wealthier clients who would request a funeral arrangement of the most pompous kind. The services we provide have to be tailor-made according to the clients' needs.\"\nEver since Hu Tao took over, the parlor's operations have been solid and reliable, with ceremonies conducted so tactfully that quite a few superstitious people in Liyue have changed their attitudes towards funerals.\nEven so, Hu Tao still has a tendency to wander off, disappearing as soon as her undertakers are busy listening to lectures.\nThe hobbies and interests of this young director are just as eccentric as her personality, and yet it is difficult to say with certainty if those activities are of a purely leisurely nature.\nHu Tao's shadow can be seen in the moonlit docks or at the highest, most precarious viewpoints in the mountains, where she's likely to take in the scenery and shape her thoughts into beautiful poetry.\nShe loves to roam freely at night, looking for inspiration. When it strikes her, no matter where she is, she cannot help but compose a poem on the spot.\nIf they are particularly lucky, the traveling merchants taking respite around the Huaguang Stone Forest can spot a mysterious girl keeping herself amused in solitude.\nHu Tao can play a four-player card game accompanied by no one for hours on end.\nThat said, the joys of engaging in such activities remain a mystery to all but Hu Tao herself.",
            "Character Story 3\tThe Ministry of Civil Affairs is guarded by two life-like stone lions, a symbol of power and authority.\nHowever, Hu Tao, who happened to be passing by the ministry building one day, saw them in a different light. At first, she examined the lions with a thoughtful look, but soon enough, her pensive face gave way to a wide smile, as she slapped them on the fore-paws.\nFrom that moment on, Hu Tao often visited and petted the stone statues. Not only would she talk to them, but also give them pet names — Whiskers for the one on the left and Mittens for the one on the right.\nOn occasion, she would even bring a bucket of water and a big brush to bathe them, each move so careful and deliberate that one might think that they were her actual pets.\nAs it happened, another feline, a living and breathing calico cat, could be found enjoying the local delicacies in front of Xinyue Kiosk, not too far from the ministry building. One day, some city folk came to play with the restaurant's favorite, providing an interesting foil for Hu Tao's peculiarities. Met with befuddled gazes of the bystanders, Hu Tao showed unwavering confidence.\n\"Sure, your kitty's cute, but the same can be said about my Whiskers and Mittens. Their fur might be harder, but they're still just as fluffy! Any animal that brings people joy may become a pet. And when it comes to majestic looks, your little fur-ball simply can't measure up to my lions!\"\nSuffice to say that this explanation was met with even greater consternation from the onlookers.\nYet the group of people shocked the most and most often by Hu Tao's antics were the ministry guards. Soft footsteps could often be heard in front of the building at around midnight. Initially, the guards suspected that it had been a thief preparing to rob officials. To their unceasing surprise, it would turn out to just be a young lady playing with the stone lions.\nThe guards were faced with an even bigger conundrum when, once everyone had reluctantly got used to her presence, Hu Tao discontinued her visits.\nThat meant that the responsibility for cleaning the statues fell on the guards' shoulders once again.\nSubsequently, they decided to keep guard by the lions for many days, anticipating Hu Tao's return. Once they finally had the opportunity to ask her why she would not visit anymore, they received the most absurd of answers.\n\"Whiskers and Mittens are adults now and can take care of themselves! Excuse me, I'm running late for my heart-to-heart with a Statue of the Seven regarding the meaning of life!\"",
            "Character Story 4\tNot long after her initial meeting with the little zombie, Hu Tao decided that, as her self-proclaimed true friend, she should grant Qiqi eternal peace.\nHu Tao would go on to kidnap Qiqi several times following much deliberation in every instance, including calculating the most auspicious time for the ceremony, aiming to follow the standard procedure of cremation, after which she would place Qiqi in a tomb on the outskirts of the city.\nIn fact, she would have succeeded already if not for Baizhu's timely interventions.\nEach time the Bubu Pharmacy's owner managed to catch up with them, Hu Tao had already had Qiqi packed in a bag, with only her head sticking out, staring in utter confusion as Hu Tao was vigorously digging a hole for the pyre.\nAfterwards, Hu Tao sent Qiqi an apology letter, in which she expressed deep regret that she had not been able to lay Qiqi to rest fast enough.\nIn Hu Tao's eyes, Qiqi passed away a long time ago, but has been trapped in this world and cannot free herself of her eternal suffering.\nBaizhu, for his part, had grown ever more relentless in his pursuit of eternal life after meeting Qiqi. This act of defiance against the cycle of life and death was unacceptable to Hu Tao.\nShe wanted to bury Qiqi not only out of consideration for her friend but also to restore the natural order.\nBut Qiqi could not disagree more, as she was afraid of death and disliked Hu Tao for her attempts.\nBecause the struggle between Hu Tao and her had been going on for so long, Qiqi has experienced a breakthrough. She has started to remember places where she might hide to avoid being captured by Hu Tao.\nPerhaps it was due to those desperate survival efforts that Hu Tao decided to do something unusual and dig deeper into Qiqi's past.\nThe story of her accident and the mystery of the adepti... That series of coincidences filled Hu Tao's heart with hesitation.\nSince Qiqi's will to live is so strong, she should not be forced to move on. Given the circumstances, she could only be treated as a rare exception that eludes the natural laws.\nEver since, Hu Tao's attitude towards Qiqi has changed drastically, to the point that she would pamper her.\nUnfortunately, the damage has been done and Hu Tao has become Qiqi's bugbear. The little zombie may need several years more to let go of her grievances.",
            "Character Story 5\tHu Tao is not, in fact, best known for her role as Director, but for her other great accomplishment: the creation of poetry.\nShe dubs herself the \"versemonger of the darkest alleys,\" and free verse flows forth untamed from her mouth whenever she has free time to be out on the streets.\nThe \"Hilitune\" is Hu Tao's most famous work, well-loved not only by the people of the harbor, but ever on the lips of children as far as Qingce Village as well.\nHobbyists and critics alike were greatly surprised by the simple but profound originality of the \"Hilitune\" and its creation, and went to Wanwen Bookhouse in droves to search for the works of this great poet. Unfortunately, Hu Tao's anthologies, named \"Fiddlesticks\" and \"Of Common Lives\" respectively, have yet to be published.\nXingqiu, ever immersed in books, also wanted to meet this strange person, and so chose an auspicious date to visit, bringing a gift with him.\nThe two hit it off immediately, and they exchanged pointers and impromptu poetry in Wangsheng's main hall — and when faced with the poetry of Xingqiu's traditional, artistic bent, Hu Tao could always return in kind with some strange and marvelous verse.\nAnd there was meaning in the chaos, indeed, a rhythm to the bizarre that anyone could perceive, and it was catchy, too.\nThus did she \"beat the old master with untrained fists,\" leaving Xingqiu at a loss for words.\nAt length, the poetic spar ended amiably, and they have been friends ever since, reading and composing poetry with one another when they have the time to meet.\nOver time, Chongyun, too, was pulled in to serve as an umpire, their laughter filling the streets.\nThe poems born from these sessions would also be recorded by bystanders.\nIf ever you should hear a pair of matched verses, one strict and the other playful, you are most likely to have heard one created jointly by Hu Tao and Xingqiu.",
            "Harmony Hexagram Hat\tThis hat is somewhat on the hard side, and the insignia of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor adorns its front.\nIt is said that this hat was passed from the 75th Director to Hu Tao. However, that director was large, musclebound, and had a head at least two sizes larger than hers.\nUltimately, Hu Tao had to spend an entire day and night to modify the hat with her own hands such that its dimensions would fit hers. When she meets others, she tells them: this hat is magical, upholding good and repelling evil, and is a bringer of peace!\nThe undertakers laugh and leave it at that, but the 77th Director clearly does treasure that hat.\nNo matter the rain or storm, or if Hu Tao returns late covered in muck, that hat will remain spotless and clean.\nThe plum blossom that adorns the side of the hat is plucked from a plum tree that Hu Tao planted and grew herself.\nIts creation process is as follows: pluck and air-dry, then paint, lacquer, and outline carefully before sun-drying for three days and voila — a beautiful accessory, soft to the touch and bearing a delicate fragrance.",
            "Vision\tThis tale should begin with the funeral of Hu Tao's grandfather.\nTen days before the funeral itself, Old Hu had passed away following a bout of illness. For its 75th Director, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor held a grand funeral, in accordance with the last wishes of the old man himself, to be conducted by Hu Tao.\nOnly thirteen at the time, Hu Tao, who would later go on to become the Director in turn, made all the arrangements herself to the highest standard, greatly impressing the undertakers.\nAfter the funeral, the thirteen-year-old Hu Tao grabbed her traveler's bag and crept out alone in the dead of night. In her bag were only a few rations, some water, and a means to create some light. She was headed to a mysterious and seldom-seen frontier.\nHeading straight from Wuwang Hill, one may arrive at the \"border.\" It is the line that separates life and death, the secrets of which have been managed by Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for generations. According to legend, it is a place where the souls of past relatives and the spirits of those with unfulfilled aspirations linger. For Hu Tao, this journey was a chance to see her grandfather once more before he departed forever.\nFor two days she journeyed unceasingly before finally arriving at her destination, yet was unable to locate her grandfather upon arrival. Between the innumerable spirits she walked, but not one of them resembled the old man.\nShe stayed there the whole day before falling asleep in exhaustion, awakening to a night sky and heavy dew. Around her were gathered a few lone spirits, clapping and laughing:\n\"Silly girl, why would Old Hu be here of all places? What were you thinking, looking for your relatives here?\"\nNot one to be swayed so easily, Hu Tao continued to wait, day after day. Her rations gradually disappeared and her water supplies drained away, but her grandfather did not appear. In the end, it was a little old woman who came to her.\nShe laid eyes on the exhausted Hu Tao and smiled as she spoke: \"Look at your stubbornness, you're exactly like Old Hu. It's a shame, but none of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Directors would ever linger here. You come from a family of plain speakers, so let me return the favor... Go back. Go back to where you came from.\"\nThe old woman bid farewell to Hu Tao, before passing over the border and into the distance. Hu Tao watched as the figure of the mysterious woman grew smaller and disappeared, as a sense of doubt tinged with relief manifested itself.\nAt last she came to the conclusion: her grandfather's absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he'd arrived, to the place where he was bound. He had been open and honest in life, leaving behind no regrets, so was it right for his departure to be framed in regretful terms?\nWith a smile, she set forth on the return journey.\nThe faraway moon had been casting a thin light on the way over but had now been replaced by the bright light of dawn. As she walked, Hu Tao thought of a saying that her grandfather had often quoted: \"Live in life, die in death. Follow your heart, do what you can.\"\nIt was noon when Hu Tao arrived home. She climbed over the wall into the rear courtyard, went straight to her room, and unpacked her travel bag.\nWith her food and water long gone, and the rest of her belongings unpacked, the bag she had taken for empty instead contained a colorful Vision. Just when had it arrived?\nAs one of the few living that had dared to visit the border, perhaps Hu Tao's actions had moved some unknown god.\nPerhaps this then constituted a heavenly gift... the ultimate recognition of her strength."

            "Character Details\tThe Knights of Favonius are the protectors of Mondstadt, the swords and shields of the city.\nIn addition to keeping the city and the surrounding travel routes safe from the threat of wild monsters, the Knights' most important responsibility is maintaining order among Mondstadt's inhabitants.\nMondstadt is the City of Freedom, but unchecked freedom without any kind of rules only invites chaos and anxiety.\nJean's understanding of this is the reason she remains diligent at all times, holding herself to impeccable standards.\nHowever, she often finds that she exhausts her monthly quota of coffee within the first few days of the month as a result.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe Gunnhildr Clan is the oldest family of knights in Mondstadt, dating back to even before the very first epic was written.\nHowever, this long and proud lineage can also be a burden. Jean was raised by her mother to be the successor to the Gunnhildr Clan.\nShe was trained in all the things a knight must know and all the qualities they must exhibit, from discipline, etiquette and conduct, to knowledge of history and ballads, as well as maintaining peak swordsmanship and physical fitness. Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: \"For Mondstadt, as always.\"\nSome time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say \"For Mondstadt, as always\" before learning to say \"Mommy.\"\nAs a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, \"Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection,\" and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.\nNow, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto.\n\"You have to give your all to do the right thing. Always.\"",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Master Jean is so reliable.\"\n\"If you ever run into trouble, seek Jean. She'll know what to do.\"\nThe denizens of Mondstadt, civilians and knights alike, all rely on Jean.\nIf someone needs help for the right reasons, Jean does not hesitate to render assistance.\nBe it a quarrel down at the market, a relationship issue...\nNo matter how unrelated it may be to a knight's job... Jean gladly lends a hand whenever she can.\n\"The chance to help someone in need is reason enough for a knight.\"\nTo her, her knightly duty takes priority over her role as Acting Grand Master. She believes helping others herself is the best way to assist.\nShe holds her fellow knights to the same standard.\nLisa the Librarian once suggested that Jean take a break and \"enjoy some afternoon tea, as is befitting of a lady.\"\nHowever, to Jean, doing that which is befitting of a knight takes priority over doing that which is befitting of a lady.\n\"Jean is so reliable.\"\nSuch is the reputation Jean enjoys in Mondstadt.\nHer only gripe is that there are not enough hours in the day. She could never help all of those in need, even by forgoing sleep.\nThe dedication and commitment required to become someone so reliable is unimaginable.",
            "Character Story 3\tGiven everything Jean has brought to her role as Acting Grand Master, people sometimes forget that there is, in fact, a Grand Master who is her superior.\nThis does not bother her in any way, though. Her role and title within the Knights of Favonius do not affect her work ethic in the slightest.\nHer passion, honesty, and meticulousness come from two things.\nOne is her education and training, which instilled in her a chivalrous spirit from a young age.\nThe other is the devoted teachings of Varka, the free-spirited Knight of Boreas and Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, currently dispatched on a crusade.\nThe effect the relaxed and unruly Knight of Boreas Varka has had on Jean's growth has been great.\n\"Grand Master, please take your job seriously. All of Mondstadt looks up to you.\"\n\"Well, you are my second-in-command, so helping me out is part of your job description. This way, I can focus on the really important things, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\"...\"\nHe is the knight of new frontiers and legendary conquests, while she is the knight of maintaining peace and freedom.\nJean does not resent Varka; perhaps there is wisdom in his conduct. However, what Varka leaves undone falls on her shoulders, and it is then down to her to do the right thing.\nHalf a year ago, Varka led the elite knights of Favonius on yet another expedition away from Mondstadt.\nAn expedition — how typical of Varka's character.\n\"I'll leave things here to you. I mean, you've basically been doing my job for years now, anyway.\"\n\"Leave it to me, Grand Master.\"\nAfter seeing the Grand Master off, Jean sat by the window and thought to herself:\nUpon your return, I will show you a kinder, more prosperous, and more peaceful Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe great tree at Windrise is where the first Dandelion Knight came to the end of her journey.\nShe was Vennessa, the founder of the Knights of Favonius and the restorer of Mondstadt.\nShe bade farewell to the city she had vowed to protect, leaving behind her legend and a single sapling.\nAfter centuries of basking in the bliss of the thousand winds, this sapling grew into a towering tree.\nJean was conferred the title of \"Dandelion Knight\" at the age of fifteen.\nThe Dandelion Knight is also known as Lionfang Knight. Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.\nOn the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.\nThe title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?\nMore than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?\nBeneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.\nThe wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:\nFor Mondstadt, as always.\nTo become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.\nTo this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.\nThe great tree at Windrise marked the end of the first Lionfang Knight's journey.\nSo too does it symbolize the beginning of Jean's.",
            "Character Story 5\tMaster Jean has a secret.\nThe Gunnhildr Clan is a venerable knightly house. This prideful blood comes from Jean's mother, Frederica.\nJean's father on the other hand is Seamus Pegg, an adventurer famed throughout the continent. When he came to Mondstadt, he dusted off his past self and started anew with the Church of Favonius, and ascended to high office within it, becoming known as the Cardinal of Daybreak.\nThe two lovers eventually parted ways. Young Jean, holding her mother's hand, would watch the silhouettes of her father and her sister, Barbara, grow ever more distant.\nLater, Barbara would follow in her father's footsteps and join the Church of Favonius, becoming a deaconess much beloved by the people.\nJean has always wanted to get closer to her younger sister by blood, but cannot bring herself to say anything when faced with Barbara's evasive eyes.\nPerhaps this all-too-similar awkwardness is a sign that the sentiment is shared.\nMaster Jean has yet another secret.\nNo matter how many times she has read the historical classics, despite her title of Dandelion Knight, and though she has become the Acting Grand Master whom everyone relies on...\nJean still loves romance novels.\nThis is not for the years as a young girl that she missed amid her training and duties, or due to the rift that formed in her parents' marriage.\nJean simply yearns for the mutual attraction spoken of in such stories, for those emotions as subtle and fragile as spider-silk.\nAs a knight, she must put Mondstadt and the Knights of Favonius first.\nBut...\n\"If I too could...\"\nIn her office, deep at night, Jean once again finishes reading \"Vera's Melancholy.\"\n\"If I have the time, it should be fine to go to Cape Oath, just before daybreak... right?\"\nLowering her head, Jean peeks out her window at the glittering stars above.",
            "Jean's Daily Schedule - Ver. XVII\tThis schedule is accurate down to the minute.\nFrom a morning run with Amber followed a breakfast trip with Lisa on the way, to doing her own laundry by hand and settling her own change of clothes at night — all things great and small pack Jean's schedule rather tightly.\nEvery completed item is ticked off, while ones delayed due to external factors list the detailed whys and wherefores.\nNext to the item \"Mondstadt Public Facilities Review\" — delayed due to a bout of illness — is written the following \"completed at 3 am, end-of-month book purchase award is canceled.\"\nJean sometimes thinks that inspiration for this schedule may have been the training program her mother drew up for her ten years ago.",
            "Vision\tIf one were to go by skill alone, Jean has long become one of the best swordsmen in Mondstadt.\nBut in Jean's heart, she would rather be a shield that defends freedom and song than a sword that cuts through corruption and darkness.\n\"Protecting\" has always been a tougher task than \"destroying.\"\nAround the time when she was promoted from Captain of her squad to Master of the Knights, a huge challenge stood before her. From without, the Fatui exerted diplomatic pressure, and from within, there were traitors — comrades of the former Inspector. Regrouping and finding a way to break through was no easy task.\nBut Jean was able to fend off the external pressure with one hand, and lead the Knights to smash the many plots of the Abyss Order with the other, re-establishing the authority of the Knights of Favonius.\nJean will never forget the moment she received her Vision. At that moment, all seemed to grow quiet as she felt the breeze flow through her hand. The world seemed to fade away, save for the time-honored motto of the house of Gunnhildr:\n\"For Mondstadt, as always.\""

Who could tell that he is a wanted man throughout Inazuma?\nEven Beidou, ever the good judge of character, could not tell that Kazuha could wield a sword with the skill of a seasoned warrior when she first decided to take him in.\nWho knows if it was the storms of life that smoothed out his rough edges, or if his natural restraint has kept his edge sheathed.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe Crux, an armed fleet from Liyue, spends much of the year on the high seas, and its sailors are quite used to the vagaries of life in other nations. So they were more curious than surprised when an outlander began serving as a sailor on their flagship, the Alcor.\nThe sailor in question was picked up when the Alcor docked at the Inazuman port of Ritou.\nBeidou had made friends with this young man, and when he came on board, she told her crew, \"This guy's gonna be staying with us for a while. Take care of him, now.\"\nThe sailors trusted Beidou's judgment and admired the newcomer for his martial prowess, not to mention his ability to predict the weather, so they were happy to overlook his reticence to discuss his past, and welcomed him aboard.\nStill, their curiosity did not abate, and they would often find all sorts of excuses to try and ply him for information about his experiences.\n\"I've heard that they make some sweet blades there in Inazuma and that the bigger the fish you are, the swankier the sword. So, uh... how's yours measure up?\"\n\"...\"\nKazuha would remain silent in the face of all such queries.\nOver time, after countless attempts to garner a response proved futile, the sailors would simply give up asking.\nEventually, it was an off-the-cuff remark from Chief Mate, Juza, just a few days later that finally managed to elicit a reply.\n\"Hey, Inazuma boy. What are the lads supposed to call you if they don't even know your name?\"\nThe young sailor wiped the sweat from his brow with his callused hands.\n\"My name is Kaedehara Kazuha, a wandering samurai. I am in your debt for taking me in, so just call me 'Kazuha.'\"",
            "Character Story 2\tKazuha was not born a commoner. He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.\nInazuma City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.\nAs the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.\nHe had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.\nTo Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.\nWhen the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.\nThese are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway — so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?\nThus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind.",
            "Character Story 3\tAll travelers who outdoors roam need some skill to call their own. For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.\nAfter leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.\nAll that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.\nIt was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.\nThe traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: \"Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!\"\nBut Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: \"If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away.\"\nBut the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.\nUpon knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.\nPerhaps it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.\nWhen he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha standing nearby, looking down at him and smiling.\nBefore the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.\nKazuha smiled and said: \"The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tKazuha made many friends during his travels. One of them was particularly close to his heart, and for a time, the two journeyed together.\nBut they too would part, for their destinations were different.\nTo have met merely by chance and then form such a strong bond, there must be a fated connection between them... so, although they would part ways for now, surely they would meet again. Or so Kazuha thought.\nBut something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition — the Almighty Shogun promulgated the Vision Hunt Decree and swore to retrieve all Visions.\nAll who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.\nIt was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a \"duel before the throne,\" and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.\nThe defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself. His friend was prepared to risk all to come before the throne, partly for the chance to fight against a strong foe, but also to demonstrate the meaning of courage to all.\nAnd yet, to call for this challenge now, of all times... Kazuha feared that his punishment, should he fail, would be absolute: The Almighty Shogun would unleash her lightning upon him in its full fury, and it would surely take his life.\nEven the normally calm Kazuha could not restrain himself. He drew his sword and stormed into Tenshukaku like a whirlwind... But alas, he arrived too late.\nHis friend's sword lay shattered in pieces, his Vision now an empty husk. Now a wanted man himself, Kazuha fled with grief in his heart.\nFrom that moment on, the days of peaceful wanderings were over, and Kazuha's life became an unending series of battles.\nKazuha did not fear battle, of course, but the constant fighting left him feeling lost and perplexed.\nHe did not regret having set out on his doomed rescue mission, nor did he begrudge his friend for leaving him, but he could not help but think...\n\"Is this endless conflict truly the only way to assert one's ideals?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe Crux Fleet became Kazuha's new home, and he drifted on the ocean wherever it took him.\nTrouble still found him from time to time, but no issue was insurmountable with the support of the Crux crew.\nFrom his vantage point on the Alcor's crow's nest, gazing out at the azure sea and sky, he finally had the space to think over the tumultuous events of his past and what it all meant to him.\n\"Every samurai wishes to live their life with passion and to claim the greatest reputation possible using the sword in their hands.\"\n\"But there will always be those whose base desires lead them astray from the path of justice and virtue, and whose blades leave an endless trail of enmity in their wake.\"\n\"Surely the heavens did not give us fleshly forms and the gods did not watch over our lives all so that we might take up arms against one another.\"\n\"Then, this sword I wield is not meant to slay, but to save...\"\n\"Yes, this shall be my path as a samurai, and I shall defend it all my days.\"\nAs he reached the conclusion of his thoughts, Kazuha was suddenly inspired to pen down a few verses to serve as a maxim for himself thereafter... but before he could get started, he was interrupted by an irate voice from down below:\n\"Hey, Kazuha, quit gawking at the sky — get down here and lend a hand!\"\nIt seemed the maxim would have to wait for another day. Whatever the helmsman, Sea Drake, needed help with clearly couldn't wait.",
            "Vision Shell\tKazuha was just as surprised as everybody else when the Vision briefly lit up during that great battle.\nFor in all the time that he had spent searching high and low trying to find someone who might rekindle it, never had he imagined that he could be the one to cause its light to shine once more. It was almost as if his late friend were lending him his aid from behind the scenes.\nThis empty shell of a Vision not only proved this, but had also brought him many fateful encounters along the way:\nHe had been aided by the resistance, saved and taken in by Captain Beidou, and he had even met the fabled Traveler...\nIn life there were seasons of hopelessness and desperation, but there were also moments of great serendipity.\nHis journey was like the rise and fall of a mountain path — at times, the struggle was all but too much to bear, but there would always be moments when he would touch the clouds.",
            "Vision\tThe morning mist covered the mountains like a blanket as Kazuha trod a small trail alone.\nThe world was silent. Not a single feather flapped, and not a single cicada sang.\nEven the roiling waves seemed to have fallen into slumber, leaving just the faint whisper of the wind audible against the silence. Kazuha stuck out his tongue — the air tasted heavy and gloomy.\nThis told him that it would soon rain.\nHe peered into the distance and spotted a plume of smoke up ahead. Below it were several straw huts. Tonight, it seemed, he would have a roof over his head.\nHe informed the owner of the house that a storm was coming. At first, he was met with skepticism, but come noon the rains arrived right on cue.\nIn awe of this wanderer's skill, the master of the house eagerly offered him lodging.\nThe storm raged into the night. Kazuha held his quilt close, and as he listened to the onslaught of rain against the autumn leaves, his mind began to wander.\nIn the time since the Kaedehara Clan's fortune had faded away and he had set off on his journey, Kazuha had traveled across many of Inazuma's islands and had become intimately acquainted with the plight of the wanderer.\nMoving between islands usually necessitated traveling by sea. Kazuha would make these trips alone, in a small, slow boat, making things all the more perilous when he had to battle against strong headwinds or violent thunderstorms...\nAnd yet, there was limitless fascination to be found in this same journey of his, where the vast sky and boundless earth was his home, and all living things that inhabited them were his friends.\nIf one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.\nBut if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.\nWith his sword in his hand and his chosen path in his heart, he could go on his way with a song on his lips and with nothing to fear, no matter the perils he may face.\nKazuha slept soundly that night, his mind at rest having made peace with his feelings.\nThe next day, he awoke to the sound of birds... and a shining Vision lying upon his chest."

            "Character Details\tKaeya Alberich is an adopted son to the Ragnvindr Family, the renowned wine tycoon.\nIt has been a long time since he last called Diluc Ragnvindr \"brother.\"\nKaeya currently serves as the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius, and is trusted by Jean.\nKaeya is often the one wrapping things up in every incident that occurs in Mondstadt's vicinity.",
            "Character Story 1\tIt is a curious fact that your best chance of finding Kaeya is not by visiting the Knights' headquarters, but by frequenting the taverns at night.\nKaeya is often found sitting at the bar, gossiping with the city folk, and sipping the famed Mondstadt beverage, Death After Noon.\nHe is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of \"top candidate for grandson-in-law.\"\nIt's hard to imagine someone as mischievous, amiable, and wine-loving as Kaeya being the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius.\nHunters and bandits alike are often among Kaeya's drinking buddies. As wary of him as they may initially be, all are ultimately disarmed by his smooth talking, and end up telling him everything he wants to know.\nDepending on what they then make privy to Kaeya, their night may turn into an uncontrollable nightmare or remain one of harmless banter.\n\"Everyone's got a secret, but not everyone knows what to do with it.\"\nSays Kaeya, with his usual arrogant smirk.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Justice is not an absolute principle, but is the result of striking that fine balance between strength and strategy. As for the details of how it's done... Don't worry yourself too much about that.\"\nKaeya once said these words in front of Grand Master Varka.\nAs long as everything falls into place the way he expects in the end, Kaeya doesn't care all that much about the means.\nThis cavalier attitude is what defines his character.\nNot so unlike Death After Noon's wild and explosive taste, one might add.\nHowever, his reckless approach to things is not uncontroversial.\nOnce, in order to force a bandit leader into facing him directly, Kaeya triggered the Ruin Guard at an ancient ruin to cut his opponent off, putting his own men at risk in the process.\nIt's times like these when even Jean, who puts a lot of trust in Kaeya, finds herself shaking her head in disapproval.\nNot that this bothers Kaeya, of course. On the contrary, he actually enjoys putting people into the difficult position of making tough decisions.\nHe takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes in the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.",
            "Character Story 3\tThe flourishing winery business in Mondstadt has been a great source of prosperity in the region over the years. This prosperity often entices greedy bandits and monsters to the area.\nThey are a motley bunch who hide in the shadows, and their backgrounds, motives, and allegiances are varied and complex.\nKaeya battles against this threat to Mondstadt not only with his sword, but also with his smarts and his wit.\nA young knight once dedicated years of his life to studying threats in and around Mondstadt, and reached an astounding conclusion:\nWhen Death After Noon is out of season due to lack of supply, the number of reported incidents inside and outside the city show a drastic decrease, and this remains the case until Death After Noon returns to the market...\nThe young knight showed his findings to Cavalry Captain Kaeya in hopes of getting some advice from him.\n\"Interesting. I'll look into it.\" Kaeya answered, with a wry smirk on his face.",
            "Character Story 4\tGenerally speaking, Kaeya is an easy person to have a conversation with. The only topic that you will never hear him discuss is his past.\nEven when the Grand Master demanded information on his background, Kaeya skirted around the issue and gave only vague answers devoid of details.\n\"One afternoon near the end of summer a decade ago, my father and I passed by the Dawn Winery.\"\n\"'I'll go get us some grape juice for the road,' he said, but he never came back.\"\n\"If Master Crepus hadn't taken me in, I doubt I'd have made it through the storm that night.\"\nThis matter-of-fact description hides a carefully constructed lie.\nKaeya has never once spoken the truth about what happened that afternoon:\n\"This is your chance. You are our last hope.\"\nKaeya's father squeezed his son's lean shoulders as he spoke, seemingly looking right through Kaeya to some place far beyond.\nOn the other side of the horizon sat their distant homeland of Khaenri'ah.\nKaeya would never forget the look of both hope and hatred in his father's eyes as he uttered those words.",
            "Character Story 5\tMany citizens still remember the two most eye-catching young gentlemen in all of Mondstadt a few years ago.\nOne of them was the dapper Diluc, an elegant swordsman who always had a warm smile and a confident posture.\nThe other was the eccentric Kaeya. He was Diluc's friend, supporter, and sounding board, ensuring he got through every challenge he faced smoothly.\nThey were almost like twins, knowing each other's thoughts and intentions without a word, protecting Mondstadt in both light and dark.\n...Until that fateful day, now ingrained deep in Kaeya's memory, when the convoy that Diluc was escorting was attacked by a huge monster.\nIt was the first and only time that Kaeya failed in his duty.\nBy the time Kaeya finally reached Diluc, it was all over.\nThe power their father had used to successfully fend off the attack backfired, taking their father's life.\nBoth Kaeya and Diluc were shocked by what they had witnessed, losing the calm composure a knight should retain.\n\"Even someone like Master Crepus would submit to such a dangerous and evil power...\"\nSinister thoughts flashed through Kaeya's mind, and he simply smirked:\n\"This world is truly... fascinating.\"\nAll while their father lay dead in a pool of his own blood. It was on that night that the two sons' paths diverged.",
            "A List\tBetween the pages of \"The Adventures of Angelos,\" you find a list of names written on a sheet of official Knights of Favonius letterhead paper.\nIt meticulously records the details of bandits in the city and further afield, as well as mercenaries and mid-to-senior-level Treasure Hoarder members, listing for each entry a name, position, area of activity, and personal profile.\nA dozen or so names are circled, with a note in the margin saying \"Otherwise, things would get too boring.\"\nWhen questioned about it, Kaeya's response is \"I suppose I must have gotten drunk and started scribbling nonsense.\"\nYour gut feeling is that Kaeya purposely let you see this list, but you have no way of proving it.",
            "Vision\tIt was raining heavily in Mondstadt on the night that Kaeya Alberich received his Vision.\nEarlier that day, Crepus Ragnvindr had wielded the power of a Delusion — only to become its victim when it backfired. To set his father free from the unbearable agony, Diluc Ragnvindr took his life.\nKaeya was Diluc's brother by adoption and was always by his side, but on this occasion Kaeya did not partake in the final moments shared between father and son.\nThe torrential rain that set in on Mondstadt that night seemed to be a sign of the heavens' grief at the passing of Master Crepus.\nThere was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: In truth, he was an agent of Khaenri'ah, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.\nIf Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?\nFor the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.\nBut now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding. As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground, he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.\nConsumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away and all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.\nHe had anticipated Diluc's anger. The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies.\nBut as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.\nBitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc’s searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.\nSince that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.\nThough it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tA pair of siblings have inherited the Kamisato Clan, one of the three most respected and prestigious clans in Inazuma City.\nThe elder brother, Ayato, is the head of the clan and is in charge of government affairs. While his younger sister, Ayaka, known by all as the Princess, takes care of the clan's internal and external affairs.\nAyaka often appears at social occasions and has more interactions with the common folk. As such, she is better known by the people and has gained a higher reputation than her elder brother. This has earned her the elegant title of Shirasagi Himegimi.\nAs is known to all, Ayaka, the daughter of the Kamisato family, is a figure greatly admired by the people for her beauty, dignified demeanor, and noble character.",
            "Character Story 1\tAcross Inazuma, all affairs of state that do not go up to the Raiden Shogun are largely handled by the Triarchal Council.\nThe Council's executive powers are, in turn, divided amongst three groups known as the Tri-Commission: the Yashiro Commission, the Tenryou Commission, and the Kanjou Commission.\nThe three clans that hold power over these Commissions are as follows: Kamisato, Kujou, and Hiiragi. These three great clans are known throughout Inazuma.\nKamisato Ayaka is the young lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, known far and wide as the Shirasagi Himegimi.\nWhen asked the whys and wherefores of such a nickname, many Inazumans have their own explanations...\n\"Lady Ayaka is as graceful and pure as an egret. And just look at her elegance, her clever yet proper speech — why should she not be named a Princess?\"\n\"Lady Ayaka may be of noble birth, but she is gentle and polite to us. She is kind, loyal, and is willing to help others. She even went against the opinions of others and took in that commoner, Thoma.\"\nThere are as many opinions concerning this as there are people, but none can say where the \"Shirasagi Himegimi\" nickname actually originated.\nStill, Ayaka's popularity amongst the people is quite plain to see.",
            "Character Story 2\tAs the daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Ayaka always has to remain alert to the jostling for power between noble families.\nBeing young, yet already famed throughout the land, she has been the inevitable target of provocation on the part of other noble scions who have grown jealous of the Kamisato siblings.\nThe creation and maintenance of a public image may be a formality, but for a house of standing like the Kamisato Clan, even meaningless routine has social significance.\nFailing to take part in the tangled web of Inazuman political relations risks their position as head of the Yashiro Commission. As such, the two siblings came to an accord.\nThe elder brother, Ayato, preferring not to show his face too often, would busy himself with government affairs, while the act of maintaining the clan's image would be the responsibility of the elegant, socially-adroit younger sister, Ayaka.\nThrough her dignified, demure, and polite posture, Ayaka has very much secured a place for herself in the social arena. Whether she is negotiating with potential partners or dealing with difficult nobles, her actions are all well-founded and beyond reproach.\nThe internal clan affairs are also in her care. Indeed, their estates may have descended into chaos already, if not for her.",
            "Character Story 3\tOne autumn afternoon, Ayaka was on her way home from completing certain minor affairs when she happened to hear an old voice singing from within an old house.\nWithin was an old woman, blind in both eyes, whose stick-thin fingers produced music like flowing water as they plucked at her instrument's strings.\nPerhaps it was due to her sharp ears, but the old lady heard Ayaka's footsteps and inquired as to who was outside. Not wishing to trouble the old lady, Ayaka replied that she was a nearby resident who had gotten lost and entered this place.\nAs a member of the Yashiro Commission, Ayaka was well-acquainted with the people's lives and quickly recognized this solitary old lady as the very same person who busked in the city streets when the weather was good.\nThe tune was outdated, and so was the song. As one who could not see, this lady had long fallen out of step with the times. Even in the nation that pursues eternity, some still endured such hard lives.\nOut of the goodness of her heart, Ayaka, thusly incognito, spent a long time chatting with the old lady. Taking Ayaka for an ordinary maiden, the old lady spoke of the method of making and playing the koto, and even gave her some tea leaves that she had kept stored up.\nCompared to the exquisite leaves that the Kamisato Clan had in stock, these rough leaves may as well have been grass, but Ayaka accepted them while profusely thanking her.\nThat day, she thought of her parents many times. Had they been around, would they not have grown this old someday?\nReturning home, she spoke of her encounter with her brother, and the two siblings shared the rustic tea gifted to her by the old lady.\nAfterward, Ayaka would come to see that old lady again every few days, each time posing as a person living nearby, and each time bringing with her some daily necessities that were well-loved by the common folk.\n\"The sakura trees in the streets have bloomed again,\" Ayaka said to the old lady with a smile, \"and they are as lovely as your music.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tIn people's imagination, the nobility's living expenses are orders of magnitude above the common folk. So for someone as noble as Kamisato Ayaka, surely she too must lead a life of wanton luxury.\nThis statement is only half right, however.\nAyaka does ostensibly live in a much more particular manner than the ordinary citizen.\nThe costs of studying flower arrangement and tea ceremony, sampling fine teas, and enjoying exotic flowers daily are also by no means small. However, these are all skills that she must master as a young lady of a noble house — such commitments can hardly be called \"wanton.\"\nThe things that can truly make Ayaka smile are, in fact, ordinary things that even the common folk can enjoy.\nThe making of snacks, fishing for goldfish by the ponds, squirreling herself away to read the latest novels from Yae Publishing House... Each one of these is but a tiny matter.\nAt such times, she is not the adored Shirasagi Himegimi, or Lady Ayaka, mistress of the great Kamisato estates. She is just \"Ayaka,\" an ordinary girl like any other.\nHere, she sets her dignified externalized persona aside and sets her true, casual self free. Only as \"Ayaka\" can she lay down her heavy burdens and do the things that ordinary girls can do.\nWhen hungry at night, she sneaks past the servants into the kitchen and makes herself some chazuke while humming a little tune. During tea ceremony classes, she might surreptitiously try to use the tea leaves to indulge in some romance-related astrology... The list of her little escapades goes on.\nThough she has never told anyone this, Ayaka treasures her time as an ordinary girl above all else, for these moments of freedom are things she rarely ever has.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe tutors who guide Ayaka in her various arts once used to say: whether in tea ceremony, chess, the art of the sword, or all other affairs of elegance, Ayaka is already a master.\nShe is clearly already a noble lady of superb bearing, skilled with both the pen and the sword. To be able to teach such a pupil is a teacher's pride and joy.\nStill, Ayaka thinks quietly to herself, does she truly have no regrets?\nThe essence of tea is peace and quiet.\nThe heart of the sword is the keenest edge.\nThe soul of chess is the wisdom to grasp the bigger picture.\nThese three she has grasped indeed, and the spirit of true friendship also.\nAnd yet, Ayaka is still waiting for a friend to emerge who can walk alongside her on equal footing and stand by her side.\nThat person cannot see her as a member of the Yashiro Commission, or as the Shirasagi Himegimi, nor will their conduct towards her be bound by decorum or status. And if possible, they might also be well-versed in a great many fields of study, and have witnessed all manner of interesting things... and perhaps they might even be able to tell her a story in a pinch.\nOnly such a person might become Ayaka's bosom friend.\n\"Surely, this is not too much to ask... But where might I find such a person?\"",
            "Moriwakamaru\t\"Come, come, come,\"\n\"Let's play Temari!\"\n\"1, 2, 1, 2, 3,\"\n\"The Temari goes up the Sacred Sakura Tree.\"\n\"4, 5, 4, 5, 6,\"\n\"Woosh, and over Mt. Yougou it flicks!\"\n\"7, 8, 7, 8, 9,\"\n\"The Temari returns into these hands of mine.\"\n\"Yes, into little~ Ayaka's~ hands~!\"\nThis was Ayaka's favorite nursery rhyme back in the day.\nBack then, she gave her favorite Temari the name \"Moriwakamaru,\" and she would dribble the multi-colored Moriwakamaru about while humming this very song.\nHearing her song, her parents and brother would be unable to stop themselves from smiling. Indeed, they would often join in the fun, tossing the Temari between them as a family.\nBut that was a long time ago, and Ayaka no longer plays games of Temari.\nShe has become an independent, powerful figure in her own right — and Moriwakamaru, the symbol of her childhood and the bearer of her precious memories, has also been stored away within Ayaka's cabinet.",
            "Vision\tSome years ago, the Clan underwent a huge change, and a heavy burden fell upon Ayato's shoulders. At that time, Ayaka was not yet the mature and capable person she is now.\nShe was originally a playful child, one who knew nothing of the clan's duties, and thus lacked the skill and experience needed for dealing with various kinds of people altogether.\nBut seeing her mother on her sickbed and her brother hard at work, Ayaka sensed that she too had to grow up.\nSo she decided to take up her long-disused sword arts and poetry, both staples of nobility. If she could master these two, she could at least pass for a decent lady of the Kamisato Clan, and thus help her brother show up at some festivals, alleviating his burden.\nTruth be told, Ayaka was not preternaturally gifted and would spend much time being troubled by her inability to memorize poetry, write elegantly, or brandish her sword.\nYet she did not waver — a poem she failed to memorize once would be memorized fifty times, a poorly-written word would be written fifty times over, and a sword technique that failed would be swung fifty times more.\n\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times.\" — This was something her mother told her.\nWhen her mother left this world, Ayaka was no longer \"Little Ayaka.\" She was now Kamisato Ayaka, the young lady of the Kamisato Clan, one of the Shogun's three great clans.\nSword art training thus became part of her daily life and has remained so to this day without pause.\nOn one particular day, Ayaka, at last, defeated an opponent in a single strike. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright.\n\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times\" indeed — and even the gods may thus be moved."

            "Character Details\tAs clan head of the Kamisato Clan, one of the great clans of the Tri-Commission, Kamisato Ayato is a household name in Inazuma.\nHowever, people do not have quite the same clear impression of him as they do of the Shirasagi Himegimi, the elegant and kind Ayaka.\nMost only know that he is an important figure in the Shogunate and the head of a famed noble house. But as for the details, there's little that they can say for sure.\nSome people say that \"the Yashiro Commission's festivals and events are ever meticulous and have been full of consideration for the people. Surely the Commissioner's hand is in all such matters.\"\nBut others also say \"ah, but there is much to politics that should never see the light of day. And how could he have kept such a lofty position without a few tricks up his sleeve, hmm?\"\nAyato himself is unfazed by such comments.\n\"Well, I consider myself merely a serious, dutiful public servant who owes his allegiance to the Almighty Shogun.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tKamisato Ayato, as the eldest son of Inazuman nobility, was greatly loved from the moment he was born.\nThough his parents were too busy to always spend time with him, they took good care of him, and in any case the \"young master\" never lacked for people around to look after his every need.\nWhen he was somewhat older, he would, at his father's request, begin a complex and strict training regimen as the family successor.\nBut not all went as well as they might have hoped, and the pressures in the court and at home would weigh heavily on his father's health, resulting in an early passing.\nThe young Ayato was thus thrust into a battle for the survival of the clan's position.\nIn those days, none were impressed by this inexperienced youngster. Ayato went from being an elegant and refined princeling to \"the poor young master of the Kamisato Clan\" amongst the people, and \"that greenhorn\" amongst his political opponents.\nTime, however, would prove these people wrong.\nWith extraordinary courage and some first-rate tactics, he did not leave the clan to languish. No, indeed, the Kamisato Clan's position would grow more stable than ever.\nThe heavy workload, malicious deceptions, and attempts to frame him at every turn he parried away, even turning them to his own advantage.\nThe passage of time has only increased the standing of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan in the Shogunate and with the people.\nToday, Ayato is a clan head that a great house like the Kamisato Clan would be proud of, and a Yashiro Commissioner acknowledged by all.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe Yashiro Commission is in charge of ritual matters on Narukami Island, and must also attend to matters of cultural leisure in such a manner that deities and the people alike are pleased — and they do, honoring their commission.\nBut with greater responsibilities come greater amounts of work.\nFortunately, his sister Ayaka shares much of the clan's responsibilities, with most of the interactions between the Commission and the people falling to her, allowing Ayato to spend most of his time on matters of governance.\nDealing with Shogunate officials is no easy matter. People come from different Commissions and clans, and their perspectives are very different. Any single task grows harder as the number of people involved grows.\nAyato's great strength lies in his ability to handle such matters. The way he sees it, people are driven by interest. Find leverage, and the other side will cooperate.\nFind some goal that will bring the other party around to your logic, then pacify them with a few choice platitudes for the occasion, and most problems can be resolved.\nAnd when dealing with the stubborn, one merely needs to appeal to a higher power to bear — after all, what mortal could gainsay the light of heaven itself, no matter how high their status or arrogant their attitude?\nOver time, the knowledgeable and decorous Kamisato clan head gained quite the name for himself in the Shogunate.\n\"Hmm... this matter seems quite hard to handle. Should we ask the Yashiro Commissioner?\"\nSo people would often say.\nHowever, while Ayato is indeed full of ways and means, he will not simply help at any given moment.\nFirstly, not every task is related to the Yashiro Commission. Secondly, it is simply not worth it for the Kamisato Clan to get itself involved for the sake of others' petty profit.\nMostly, Ayato will simply tag along as a junior figure, teacup in hand, doing little more than smiling.\n\"Ah, come now, Sir Nagaoka. We are all loyal servants of the Almighty Shogun. Nothing more to it. We just need to be open with each other, and I'm sure we can resolve this issue together.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tBeing limited by his station and work, Ayato does not often appear in public, nor does he have much time for any sort of leisurely walk. However, these obstacles cannot hinder him from learning of new and interesting things.\nPerhaps in the morning, he might spy one of the Yae Publishing House staff poking her head around the place, seemingly here to \"report for work.\" In which case, he may as well pretend not to notice, all the better to hear what new methods she has for skipping work... and then \"accidentally\" let slip his newfound knowledge to Guuji Yae.\nIn a meeting with those old fogeys at Tenshukaku, there is no need to speak too quickly. After all, watching grown people argue till they are red in the face over petty issues is quite amusing.\nWhile walking through the streets, he might suddenly consider a certain unique snack stand. Going up to the owner, he'd ask if they are selling anything new, how business is going, buy a drink or two to try... and if he finds it interesting, he'll buy a few back for the rest of the household.\nLately, he also lent some encouragement to the young oni who frequents Hanamizaka due to the latter's bug-fighting troubles — out of the goodness of his heart, of course. He also discovered that this crimson oni did not know what the name \"Ayato\" signified... which was fine, of course. No need to explain such things.\nOn the way home, he might pass Chinju Forest and see passers-by having tricks played on them by the bake-danuki, in which case he will point the illusion out. If the bake-danuki should hone their changeling skills further on his account, why, they should thank him for the inspiration.\nAnd of course, even one so talented as Thoma might sometimes struggle to think of what to make for dinner. Such occasions are perfect for a hot pot game! After all, Ayaka always puts the most unexpected things into the pot — and how proud he is of his sister for that!\nYes, these things are indeed the spice of the Yashiro Commissioner's life.",
            "Character Story 4\tBetween the butler and the housekeeper, the Kamisato estate is always spick and span, inside and out... except for one location.\nKamisato Ayato's table is always a terrible mess after he uses it.\nBooks are strewn about, open and even dumped face-down on the table, while documents of uneven size are stacked haphazardly. The ink on the inkstone is never really properly kept, and one might even sometimes find chess pieces or cards under the table.\nEach time the clan head gets off work, the servants always need some time to clean his study up.\nIn the process, they discovered that assorted notes are often clipped between these pages. Upon closer inspection, they are written in different hands, and their content also varies.\n\"Clan Head, the servants have sent a new batch of flowers. I have placed them in a flower vase in a corner of the table. Please take care not to knock it over again.\"\n\"Clan Head, a shrine maiden from the Grand Narukami Shrine came over today, saying that the Lady Guuji wishes to see you. It seems important, as it involves the requisitioning of land in Ritou. She invites you to the Shrine to discuss the details.\"\n\"Lord Commissioner, the Momoyo flowers have not withered. The branches grow yet. Do not worry.\"\n\"Dear Brother, I learned a new recipe while attending festivities with the Traveler. Considering that {Mhe}{Fshe} is from another land, do you think... that I might need to make some changes to said recipe?\"\n\"Clan Head, the servants have been reluctant to tell you this, so allow this old lady to say it. If you wish to eat something, please leave it to our housekeeper. Also, please refrain from using the ingredients in the kitchen... How could we make you cook for yourself, after all?\"\nAyato's work often sees him leaving home early and returning late. As such, the people of the Kamisato Estate will communicate with him through these means.\nThis was a method that Ayato came up with himself, and this is how the Kamisato household is run, via these small notes.\nUnfortunately, their use has seen the clan head's already messy table become messier still... Oh well, just a small sacrifice. Nothing worth writing home about.",
            "Character Story 5\tIn Inazuma, people will sometimes pray to deities by offering certain kinds of cypress leaves.\nBut as such rituals lack scale, they are often forgotten amidst the many, both large and small, that are conducted throughout the land.\nThough some time has passed, Ayato still remembers his mother mentioning that though these cypresses are evergreen, their leaves are not needle-like.\nInstead, they have large, crisp leaves that will not wither and fall even when new ones grow.\nAs such, it is associated with the concept of \"prosperity,\" and was often used in ancient times as ritual plating for food offerings.\nToday, people no longer use leaves as mats upon which to spread food, but the habit of offering cypress leaves persists nonetheless.\nPerhaps it was just a hobby of hers, or perhaps she was just well-read in general, but whatever the case, his mother always had a great deal to say about festival affairs.\n\"Perhaps the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission were born to protect the deities.\"\nIn his younger years, Ayato had not fully agreed with this statement.\nHe believed that the Kamisato Clan was the Kamisato Clan, and that it belonged to the family's members. That was the reason for its existence, and any service to the gods was a job, a matter of circumstance.\nBut such presumptuous words could never be said out loud, and in any case, Ayato could not bear to interrupt his mother when she looked so excited.\nNo matter how long she would go on, Ayato would always sit in front of her and listen in silence, even if his legs might fall asleep in the process.\nWith the passing of years, Ayato's days would be taken up by swordsmanship and books. The one giving the \"lessons\" was now his father, and the lesson content would turn from ritual affairs to matters that the clan's successor should be concerned with.\nHis duty to the clan would be something that would occupy yet more space in Ayato's life. Nor was the Raiden Shogun just a mere symbol as she was in his childhood. Now, she was the Ogosho, the mighty defender of Inazuma's eternal peace.\n\"The Kamisato Clan stands today because of Narukami's mercy. As such, the Clan must defend the road to Eternity, and follow the Shogun eternally.\"\n\"This was our agreement, and it is the unchanging rule of our clan. Remember this well.\"\nAs for the specifics of what happened, Ayato had already gleaned some of them from reading their ancestral teachings. It was the Kamisato elders' failings that had resulted in the nationally-important Raiden Gokaden to suffer great loss. If not for Guuji Yae's intervention on their behalf, causing the Shogun to show them mercy, the Kamisato Clan may have joined others in falling from grace and ceasing to exist.\nThis was the grace of Her Excellency, and at the same time, it was a warning from Her servant.\nAs such, Ayato never snubbed his father's teachings. Though he still believed in protecting his clan above all else, he also understood that Inazuma was sustained by the Electro Archon's protection. Only peace in Inazuma could guarantee the longevity and prosperity of the clan.\nNo matter how things might change in Inazuma, the Kamisato Clan alone would never betray the Almighty Narukami.\nEven if his heart said differently, he could only bury it deep beneath well-maintained appearances.\nJust as his mother said back then—\n\"The divinely-protected cypress will sprout new leaves from ancient branches.\nSo, too, can the camellia in the courtyard remain fragrant even in the most bitter winter.\"",
            "Yumemiru Pen Case\tEven Kamisato Ayato himself could not have expected that calligraphy practice, which he had found most boring in his youth, would eventually become a favored pastime of his.\nHe had slogged through much penmanship practice to better play the part of the Kamisato Clan's eldest son.\nBut nowadays, he transcribes a few poems from time to time to clear his mind and think in silence.\nOf course, this also lets him seem like he is busy with official business even while idle, all the better to avoid seeing some people and doing certain things.\nWith time's passing, it became agreed among the servants waiting on him that he not only liked to play chess but was also fond of calligraphy.\nSuch talk would spread widely via word of mouth. As such, Ayato often receives excellent brushes as gifts during festivals or birthdays.\nSome of the more speculative have even bought him exquisite and expensive quill pens from overseas.\nAyato has never attempted to clarify this matter, but instead had a lovely wooden case made in which he stores such stationery.\nHe has always been interested in all things new, and trying out these new pens is indeed fun.\nMoreover, these gifts often say much about the person who sent them. Such information thus becomes one of the means by which Ayato can get a handle on them.\nThat said, though he claims to have bought this case to store stationery, there are three pens that Ayato has never placed inside it.\nOne of them, slim and well-crafted, is placed on his desk. It shows signs of some wear and tear, but it writes well, and is used for writing petitions.\nThe second is stored in a drawer at the bottom, its fine tip having seen much loving use in the past when Ayato was practicing calligraphy. Its beginner-friendly nature also saw it borrowed quite often by Thoma and Ayaka back in the day.\nAs for the third, it is stored deep within a wooden cabinet used to store antiques, sealed within a silk bag. Excellent of make and design, it was presented to him by his mother during his adulthood ceremony.",
            "Vision\tOne night, many years ago, Ayato's gravely-ill father summoned him into his presence.\nThat night, his father seemed a little different from the illness-weathered figure he had become. His expression was solemn, and yet the concern in his eyes was all too clear.\nForcing himself to stay alert, he asked Ayato: was his training done? Had he eaten enough for dinner? How was his swordsmanship progressing?\nAs Ayato replied, his father nodded with a smile, seemingly satisfied. Yet, his expression would quickly darken, as if there was something he wanted to, but could not say.\nAfter much hesitation, and under his wife's melancholic gaze, his father would finally speak, his voice heavy:\n\"Ayato... Remember, no matter what happens to the Kamisato Clan in the future, you are our eldest son, Ayaka's elder brother... A successor the Kamisato Clan is proud to have.\"\nAfter reminding his father to rest well, Ayato would take leave of his parents and return to his bedroom.\nThe moment he opened the door, he saw the shining Vision lying on his desk.\nAyato had heard since he was young that Visions are signs of the gods' favor, born of human wishes.\nSince his youth, he had longed to become the family's pillar, not for any great work, but to ensure that the clan would prosper, and to protect them.\nThat this Vision should appear now... meant that, perhaps, the time had come for him to take up this burden.\nSo thinking, Ayato did not call for the servants to light the lamps. Instead, he merely sat down beside the table.\nMany things flowed through his mind then like a tide:\nHis father was gravely ill, and his mother was also unwell. The clan was leaderless, and its competitors eyed its position and power hungrily, as they had for some time now.\nHis sister was still young, and he had to ensure that she grew up safely. The Shogunate courts were like a sea full of hidden reefs. One had to tread most carefully there...\nThey could not let go of the Shuumatsuban, command over which had passed down through the family for generations. As for the servants, some few might still be trusted should the Kamisato Clan's strength wane...\nAnd as for Thoma, who had come from a different land, though he was a friend and useful ally both, would he consider other options should the Kamisato Clan truly fall?\nThese scattered thoughts would gradually straighten themselves out in Ayato's mind, and at their center was his still-unchanged conviction—\nHe would use any means at his disposal to secure the safety of his family and its future. Obstacles to that goal would be cleared away, no matter the cost.\nThat night, the Vision was the only light that accompanied him.\nAnd when the first light of the next dawn alighted upon the desk, the young heir was already prepared to face the world."

I have plenty of self-confidence in other areas, so why not in this? ...I can catch up with him — I WILL catch up with him! I just need to keep my chin up, keep trying, and keep learning!",
            "About the Vision: Skepticism\tIf a Vision means the approval of the gods, then I don't see why I should want one. In fact, I find it quite insulting...

            "About the Vision: Reflection\tOh, so... Rex Lapis wanted me to have power beyond the average mortal so that I can be a great leader? Huh...

Maybe I should start with a half hour instead?",
            "Something to Share: Souvenir\tWhat do you mean, Geo Archon paraphernalia? ...You're not suggesting my bedroom is full of that stuff, surely? I'm not a child anymore! Although...

Look, just because I own an idol or two does not mean that I idolize him, okay!?",
            "Interesting Things\tI once heard a Mondstadt fable about courage being what it takes for birds to learn to fly.

            "About Ningguang: Cooperation\tSince Rex Lapis left us, we've actually found some common ground. I was quite judgmental of her in the past, and we still fundamentally disagree on a number of issues, but in the current climate I have to say I count her as a comrade in arms.",
            "About Ningguang: Trifling Matters\tUgh, having said that... I ordered a Lucent Crescent from Mingxing Jewelry three months in advance, and when it was finally time to pick it up, they told me Ningguang had bought up the last few months' worth of Lucent Crescents for herself by paying double the price! *sigh* She can be such a pain!",

            "About Ganyu: Skepticism\tWho knows what Rex Lapis must have done to inspire such blind devotion from Ganyu... But her reluctance to be critical is not without its advantages.

            "About Ganyu: Reflection\tI find myself getting a second opinion from her a lot these days. Lots of things come up that I just have no idea about, and of everyone in Liyue, she's probably the most familiar with Rex Lapis. Heh...

In addition to reviewing his own past deeds, I've been researching the other archons' modes of governance, too. Mondstadt's god is the one who baffles me the most though — how exactly do any of his actions contribute to the longevity of Mondstadt? It's completely beyond me.",
            "About Yanfei\tThe way I see it, the law is a summary of things done the right way in the past.

            "Character Details\tRex Lapis has brought prosperity and plenty to Liyue Harbor, and his rule and majesty have long passed into show and song, much to the delight of the people. But for someone in such proximity to a god, Keqing seems to lack the requisite respect the most.\n\"Hmph. Let's be real here, but does Morax really know everything?\"\nThe Liyue Qixing deal with the day-to-day happenings in the Harbor, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.\nWhile history has shown that following Morax's lead has been the right call, Keqing believes that humans should have their pride and that their views deserve equal consideration.\nAs such, she often advocates different opinions from Rex Lapis, and is the first to put such views into practice.\nHer radical actions have seen stellar results, but they have also attracted murmurings of opprobrium among those devoted to Rex Lapis.\nAs Keqing sees it, such opposition are the excuses of those who have grown complacent under the aegis of their deity, and who cannot consider the future of humanity of their own accord.\nBut someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and create a new path with their own hands — and the Yuheng star is determined to do her part in this endeavor.",
            "Character Story 1\tKeqing is the daughter of an illustrious Liyue family with a proud lineage, and she is better acquainted than most with the influence that Rex Lapis has over the people of Liyue.\nOnce every few years, in an almost cyclical fashion, a major reshuffle hits Liyue's economy after the Rite of Descension. Once Rex Lapis' new policies are announced, some families celebrate while others grieve.\nThe poor hope it will offer them the chance to finally make their fortunes while the wealthy pray that theirs will not be swept away in the changing tides. Rather than carefully analyzing the economic climate, merchants are more prone to making investments based on belief.\nAnd in present-day Liyue, this is a forgivable strategy: Rex Lapis is a powerful deity and he can be relied on for all things.\nBut Keqing has her reservations about all this: What if, one day, Rex Lapis stops fulfilling his duty? Then what would become of the people of Liyue?\nLiyue's present prosperity is akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.\nHowever, Keqing has been unable to garner majority support for her views. From most people's perspective, life is but a brief, insignificant moment in Liyue's long history, and there is no point in working oneself up into an existential quandary.\nThis perspective, as far as Keqing is concerned, is a lazy and cowardly one that denies there is any value at all in the existence of the human race. \"If humans really have no value,\" Keqing retorts, \"then why should we expect the gods to care about us so much?\"\nUnwilling to compromise on her beliefs, she cast her skepticism on everything — everything from Rex Lapis' loving-kindness, to the people's laziness, to the way that society runs.\nIssues affecting humans' fate should be handled by humans, and humans are more than capable of handling them with finesse.\nFinally, the day came of her now-famous speech at the Rite of Descension.\n\"Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?\"\nOn hearing these words, Rex Lapis burst into hearty laughter. But as for what exactly he was laughing about, only Rex Lapis himself knows.",
            "Character Story 2\tSome may be able to keep up with Keqing's forward-thinking ideas, but none can keep up with her pace of work.\nPerhaps in an effort to become a role model for her people, she demands of herself to work ten times harder than the average person, and she cannot abide any measure of laziness or inefficiency.\nHumans' abilities and lifespans are more limited than the gods'. This means that one has no hope of living to see the day when humans replace the gods as masters of our own universe if one allows apathy and hesitation to slow themselves down.\nBecause of this same mindset, she is never able to synchronize her work rhythm with the people around her.\nWhatever the task, she does not rest until the job is done, and when something should take half the month to resolve, she will pull out all the stops to try and get it turned around within the next 48 hours.\nAdditionally, Keqing's notion of 'completing' something is far more ambitious than simply getting it 'finished' — she will make sure that every relevant detail is tied up too. To the outside observer, she seems to be both highly efficient and a perfectionist.\nBut not everyone is as self-motivated as Keqing. No assistant she hires ever makes it past the three-month mark.\nShe has received countless remonstrations urging her to be less impatient, but she meets each one with a stern rejection.\nStill, she has, to some extent, come around to the idea that a high staff turnover is itself a manifestation of inefficiency, and made some concessions accordingly.\nToday, if you encounter an assistant of Keqing's dealing with some matter three, four, or even five years ahead of time, don't be alarmed, this is completely normal. Keqing gave them a bit of a head start, but she'll be catching up before long.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"Yesterday's experiences make me stronger today.\" This is one of the principles Keqing lives by.\nSpending all of one's time at Yujing Terrace means seeing the same old things day after day. But to be able to think and act as swiftly as lightning, one needs a huge amount of experience to draw on.\nSo, if Keqing sees something that needs doing, why, she'll do it herself. For example, she once served for two months as a laborer to better decide how to refine a plan to improve their treatment.\nIt's hard to imagine that this young lady with so much authority vested in her has pulled carts at The Chasm, rammed earth at the south wharf, and waited tables at small diners.\nIn addition to working, she also once took the opportunity to gather evidence with which to report a powerful individual known for his abuses.\nHe was apprehended without any clue as to how he had been exposed, but when he was brought to the interrogation chamber by the Millelith, there he saw a striking young lady dressed in fine robes.\n\"Hey! Haven't we... haven't we met somewhere before?\"\nThe words felt foolish the moment they rolled off his tongue, even to him.\nEspecially because the Millelith then introduced her as follows: \"This is the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Know your place and keep your distance!\"\n—Exactly, so what was he thinking!?",
            "Character Story 4\tRex Lapis' departure has put Liyue Harbor through a great deal of hardship. All the duties Rex once fulfilled have been taken up by the Qixing and the Eight Trades.\nNow that divine rule is a thing of the past, the old strictures left behind can't simply be continued wholesale. But to establish new laws for Liyue, whose history spans several thousand years, is no mean feat.\nAt first, Keqing was incredibly enthusiastic about this task, having long prepared for this day when she might finally show her mettle. But several months in, and she was still stuck on a single task, land infrastructure — and it was driving her up the wall.\nNo matter how hard she struggled, the mountain of tasks was like a quagmire. She was making difference, yes, but not nearly with as much ease as Rex Lapis.\n\"Why can I only do this much? Why... can't I do it better?\"\nOf course, she had long understood the wherefores here.\nHer lack of respect for gods had somehow received their recognition all the same, yes, but that didn't mean that she was ready to simply replace them.\nBut she was still Keqing, resolute and tenacious.\nFrom that day on, she shut herself in, studying classics of various kinds to learn all that she needed. Placing herself lowest, she accepted all that she had hitherto not known with open arms.\nDuring this period, she gained a certain calm, slowly discarding the \"opprobrium\" she had long held against Rex Lapis.\nThey were both working for the good of Liyue, after all — and two people who love the same thing need not be on opposing sides.\nShe also seemingly came to an understanding concerning the smile Rex Lapis had given her during that Rite of Descension. It was, Keqing now believes, an expression of acknowledgment and expectation.\nShe hasn't lost any of her forceful and decisive manner, no. But sometimes, when she feels lost, she will stop and think: \"What would Rex Lapis do at a moment such as this?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tKeqing, who has dedicated a large portion of her energies to Liyue Harbor, indulges in an unexpected pastime when she can spare a moment — shopping.\nOn her days off, she changes into ordinary clothes, contacts a few close friends, and enjoys a day of strolling around Feiyun Slope and Chihu Rock, just enjoying the act of buying things.\nAfter Rex Lapis' departure, Keqing managed to maintain this method of decompression despite her busier schedule, though with one subtle difference.\nOn one of her shopping trips, she happened upon a small and unremarkable stall that sold cute Rex Lapis clay figurines with tiny bodies and big heads.\nPersuading her friends to visit the silk store opposite, she approached the stall, took a figurine in her hand, and began to examine it.\nShe knew that she didn't have much time. So, after glancing around to make sure that no one was watching, she paid for, picked up, and packed away her prize in one swift single movement.\nBut no sooner had she placed the figurine into her bag and heaved a sigh of relief than one of her friends, silk bundles in tow, tapped her on the shoulder.\nIn the end, all was revealed. Her friends were quite curious: Wasn't Keqing a skeptic among skeptics? Why would she buy one of these?\n\"For... For introspection, of course! There's nothing wrong with self-reflection, is there?\"\nSo she said, and it would be convincing, too — if Keqing didn't already have an entire shelf dedicated to Rex Lapis self-reflection memorabilia...",
            "Survival Hairpin\tThough she is of noble birth, Keqing tries to keep her luxuries to the bare minimum that would befit her position as one of the Liyue Qixing.\nAnd when she is outside the borders of the prosperous city, she will often head deep into uninhabited areas to strengthen her knowledge and sharpen her will.\nShe has experienced countless challenges, but unlike backpackers and adventurers, she does not bring anything with but her hairpin and her sword.\nAs long as it is infused with Electro, a hairpin can become a knife of unmatched sharpness. Cutting grass, chopping firewood, skinning game, and carving bone are all well within its capabilities.\nIf faced with a drop of great height, she only needs to pin it into the ground, tie rattans to it, and rappel down.\nIt also serves as an incredibly sensitive security device when camping out. Any unusual movements nearby will cause it, when tipped over and placed perpendicular to the ground, to alert and awaken Keqing immediately.\nIt can even be used to fish: Keqing just hurls it into the water when she's feeling peckish, and there will always be a few fish that will get knocked out by the electric shock — and of course, finding a stick to grill the fish on is not a problem either.\nSome narrow-minded folk have ridiculed Keqing's hairpin for being old and worn, but this does not anger her. Indeed, she considers it a point of pride.\n\"Its weathered form is what gives it its charm.\"",
            "Vision\tKeqing is likely a skeptic without equal when it comes to the value of Visions.\nShe knows that everything she has is the result of her own hard work, but that in the eyes of others, credit has been given instead to her Vision.\nShe once believed that this purple crystal had stolen the pride due originally to her, and that it was both a challenge and an insult from the gods.\nIn fact, she has tried to destroy her Vision countless times — she's left it in a huge fire for three days and three nights, run over it with a minecart full of rocks, and has even hurled it from the heights of the Jade Chamber.\nUnfortunately, she has never been successful.\nWith no options left, and not wanting it to fall into the wrong hands, Keqing was forced to accept the Vision as part of her life.\nOver time, Keqing came to appreciate her Vision. She realized that this item did not actually have any divine will imbued within it, and that it also had numerous practical uses. Thus, she decided to make use of it.\n\"The source of power is far less important than the character of its user.\"\nRegardless of how she may once have regarded it, Keqing's Vision and its powers have become a part of her.\nThank the Archons she hadn't destroyed it back then, or she'd have regretted it for sure — oh, the hardships of being a pragmatist."

            "Something to Share\tAt the Knights of Favonius building, you're not allowed to blow up the walls. Shame, it would make getting out of solitary confinement way easier... but if I did so much as try to blow up the wall, Jean would make sure Klee never sees the light of day again. That's what Jean said, Kaeya told me.",

            "About Albedo\tMe and Albedo have a secret code! Whenever he puts a sign on his workshop door saying \"Experiment in Progress,\" that's code for \"Come Back Later, Klee.\" Albedo's really nice and he's so patient with me, so I don't mind waiting until he's finished with his work.",

            "More About Klee: III\tSure, time in solitary confinement gives lots of time to think about new gunpowder formulas... But it'd still be better to not be in solitary in the first place.",
            "More About Klee: IV\tThis is Dodoco, my oldest and bestest friend! Okay, now I've introduced you, don't forget her name again alright? No more calling Dodoco \"that silly doll Klee always hangs on her rucksack.\"",

            "Character Details\tWhen the patrons of Mondstadt's taverns are asked about the strongest knight of the Knights of Favonius, three names are likely to come up:\nThe highly reputable Acting Grand Master Jean, Cavalry Captain Kaeya, and the mysterious tycoon, Diluc.\nHowever, some claim to have witnessed, albeit through bleary, drunken eyes, a knight in red, leveling the entire Stormbearer Mountains.\nIf one wants to find this mysterious knight, then they need look no further than the solitary confinement cell inside the Knights of Favonius Headquarters.\nIf the cell is found vacant... then something explosively unfortunate is likely about to take place...\nKlee is well known for the danger she presents. As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated.\nAs a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.\nAfter all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives.",
            "Character Story 1\tThree years ago, Klee was entrusted to the Knights of Favonius by her parents, who were famed adventurers.\nThis was how the fates of Klee and \"that boy in white\" became intertwined with their \"family\" in Mondstadt.\nKlee is curious about everything in the outside world. She has an innocent passion for explosives, and is incredibly enthusiastic in all that she does.\nUnder the protection of the Knights of Favonius, she is protected from harm and those of ill intent.\nThis young girl soon forged an unbreakable bond with everyone in the Knights of Favonius.\nBeing sent to the solitary confinement room by Jean, helping Amber improving Baron Bunny, as well as developing new bombs...\nThese parts of Klee's life are all invaluable treasures to her.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree...\"\nJean sighs to herself as she sits down at her desk, head in hands, faced once again with a stack of damage reports.\nCarts blasted beyond repair, storage shacks burnt down, forest fires that the knights barely managed to contain...\nNot to mention the suspiciously high number of deaths from unnatural causes among the fish of Starfell Lake.\nThere's only one potential culprit behind all of this, and she just so happens to be one of their own...\n\"Klee!\"\nFaced with Jean's stern glare, the harmless-looking Klee surrenders all her concealed explosives.\nShe is then escorted to solitary confinement, despite her protests amidst floods of tears.\nThis occurs about once or twice a week at the Knights of Favonius.",
            "Character Story 3\tOf course, Klee always tries to help clean up the messes she's made.\nHowever, sometimes her reckless personality makes things worse still.\nFor example, she once wanted to apologize to everyone by making some BBQ fish, but ended up blowing the stove sky-high.\nThen there was the time she got into a fluster and tried to put the fire out... with wind — which obviously resulted in the whole plain going up in flames.\nKlee is not a bad kid by nature, it's just that her curious and playful nature always results in her failing to think before she acts.\nAnd every time she gets into trouble, she guiltily tries to make up for it.\nThough once Jean lets Klee out of solitary confinement, there's usually no more than a day or two before the sound of explosions return to Mondstadt.\nThe \"Spark Knight\" always manages to live up to her title in a range of unexpected ways.",
            "Character Story 4\tThough Klee always ends up causing trouble for the Knights of Favonius and Mondstadt, she isn't just some rookie who drags the team down.\nOn the contrary, her skills with explosives can be quite handy if applied correctly.\nOnce, Jean was able to defeat a horde of invading hilichurls utilizing Klee's special talents alone.\nHowever, Klee also forever changed the face of Stormbearer Mountains in that same operation due to recklessly placing too many charges...\nNeedless to say, everyone was more than a little shocked, but at least no one from the Knights of Favonius was injured.\nSince then, the legend of the \"Red Knight of the Stormbearer Mountains\" began to circulate around Mondstadt.\nRumor has it that she is cloaked in red, and clutches the greatest treasure the Knights of Favonius have.\nHowever, only Klee knows what this \"treasure\" truly is.",
            "Character Story 5\tTo Klee, the Knights of Favonius are family, and she can't imagine life without them. Her biggest role model, however, is still her birth mother — the avid adventurer, Alice.\nA highly renowned adventurer and author of the popular Teyvat Travel Guide, there is nothing this incredible mother cannot do — as far as Klee is concerned, anyway.\nWhether it's the way she used to guide Klee step-by-step through the techniques for adding gunpowder and selecting fuses, or the encouragement she'd give Klee to express her creativity through ever-bolder and more beautiful fireworks...\nOr that time she taught her how to identify Starsnatch Cliff's load-bearing points, then place explosive charges accordingly to bring the whole thing down...\nOr that time they stuck their tongues out at each other awkwardly while being told off by Huffman of the Knights of Favonius...\nKlee has many treasured memories of her mother.\nThis was the way things were until her parents left to travel to somewhere dangerous and far away. They entrusted Klee to the care of Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.\nThough still small, Klee knew she would one day become just like her mother.\nOne day, her explosives would become something that her mother would be proud of.",
            "\"Dodoco\"\tDodoco is Klee's first friend, and one of her best.\nA very long time ago, her mother made this doll for her by hand.\nAlice affixed it to Klee's four-leaf clover, and hung on her big backpack.\nFrom that day forth, Klee and Dodoco became inseparable.\nHer mother said that this would ensure that Klee would never be lonely and that she would have a friend to confide in even when she was alone.\nThey would also protect each other in times of danger, just like Amber and Baron Bunny.\nThis, however, worried the Knights quite a fair bit — considering the other things Alice and her daughter had invented, perhaps this, too, might explode at any time...\n\"Dodoco\" is a name Klee picked herself.\nWhen asked what this name meant, she flushed red for a good long while before replying: \"It means... Klee's best friend!\"",
            "Vision\tAsking Klee how she obtained a Vision will probably get you nowhere — she doesn't know, either.\nA natural-born pyromaniac, Klee had already been acknowledged by a Vision from a very young age.\nAccording to Klee herself, she had been creating a bomb that was \"even bigger than super big!\"\nThis was her very first solo project, but the results were far from expected—\nWell, she \"only\" blew her small workshop sky high, leaving a mountain of smoking ash.\nBut rather than being disappointed, Klee was pleasantly surprised to see a flaming Vision emerge from those ashes.\nHow did Klee receive this divine acknowledgment?\nWas it her talent and passion for explosives, the individualistic nature she got from her mother, or her shining innocence?\nRegardless, Klee had already obtained such a coveted item at a tender, carefree age.\nRegardless of what she faces as she grows up, she will never give this \"present\" up."

If you were to make a habit of asking me this question every time before you move out, you would find that you only receive an answer from me one time out of 10.

The Almighty Shogun's manner is always resolute, and I do not always fully grasp the meaning of her words. But this is her decision, and I trust her.",
            "About the Raiden Shogun: Service\tSo, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake.

All I know is that however perilous the road ahead may become, I will follow her as I have always done.",
            "About Yae Miko\tGuuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her. But... if there ever comes a day when she disobeys the Shogun's will, then please accept my apologies in advance.",
            "About Sangonomiya Kokomi\tShe is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of. I wonder if I should adopt this technique for commanding the Shogun's Army? Hmm... but this could lead us to a situation whereby war is waged at the negotiation table, each side with their pack of strategy cards, playing them one by one until a victor emerges... Then again, perhaps not.",
            "About Gorou\tGorou is to Sangonomiya Kokomi as I am to the Raiden Shogun. He is fiercely loyal, and I have great respect for this. It's a shame we're on opposing sides, so we'll never get to work together... Still, I am glad to have an admirable foe. Also... I hear he's a fifth-born son. That just makes it even better.",
            "About Arataki Itto\tTsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest oni I've ever encountered. He showed he was enough of a man to admit defeat, but the rematch he insisted upon... Tsk... To this day, I still don't want to talk about it. If you really must know, you can go and ask him yourself.",
            "About Kuki Shinobu\tWith her talent and qualifications, it's a shame she decided to join the Arataki gang. I must concede, however, that at the very least, her presence has effectively prevented idlers from stirring up trouble and disturbing the public, reducing the burden on the Tenryou Commission.",
            "More About Kujou Sara: I\tYou want to know more about me? ...Know what, exactly? I can't discuss Tenryou Commission business with you, that's strictly confidential, and I certainly can't divulge anything relating to the Almighty Shogun. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Hmm? Me on a personal level...? I suppose that's not out of the question, just... unprecedented.",
            "More About Kujou Sara: II\tI lead a relatively simple life when I'm not leading an army into battle. I always get out of bed at 5:05 on the dot. Then I go to the courtyard where I take five deep breaths before walking five laps around it. For breakfast, I typically eat five mouthfuls... Five is my lucky number, so I do things in fives. Do you have some objection to that?",
            "More About Kujou Sara: III\tThe thing that gave me the most trouble when enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree was those officers of the Shogun's Army who would abuse their authority to be heavy-handed with those we detained. The will of the Almighty Shogun must be executed, but I do not condone violence against innocent people! I have expressly forbidden such behavior on countless occasions but judging by the outcome, it seems difficult to root out. If you have any ideas on how to tackle it, please share them with me.",
            "More About Kujou Sara: IV\tAlthough I was fully adopted by the Kujou Clan, I know that Takayuki does not look at me the same way he looks at Kamaji. I might be a little stone-faced sometimes, but even I get lonely... especially when I catch sight of one of my subordinates sharing an intimate moment with their family. ...\nI'm sorry, I have nothing but gratitude for Takayuki. How could I be so disrespectful...",
            "More About Kujou Sara: V\tNow that I think about it, you and I are a good example of achieving concord through conflict. We were on opposite sides — diametrically opposed, you could say. I never imagined I would end up alongside you, either in battle or in long conversation... Fate has been kind to me, no, sorry, ignore that.",
            "Kujou Sara's Hobbies\tTo this day, not a day goes by without bow exercises and target practice. From adopting the stance, to aiming, to hearing the twang of the bowstring, none of this is dry and repetitive for me — it is about transcending the me of yesterday! I wouldn't call it a hobby so much as a lifelong discipline.",
            "Kujou Sara's Troubles\tThe existence of a tengu warrior's wings is an objective fact, as is the reality that they will take up a certain amount of space when standing side-by-side. So when you say \"come closer,\" I fail to see how exactly I am supposed to achieve that.",
            "Favorite Food\tI have always had a preference for easy-to-carry foods that provide quick and ample sustenance, such as Onigiri. The top choice for replenishing your stamina in the middle of a battle! But that's just a personal preference. I don't dictate what my subordinates have to eat.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI generally avoid sweet foods, not that I have a strong aversion to them. Why? Well, sweet things put your mind and body at rest, so if I ever eat sweet things it's easy to... Ahem, essentially, I mustn't slack off and that's the end of it. No further questions on this topic!",

            "Character Details\tThe blood of the tengu runs through Kujou Sara's veins, but she does not dwell in the forests and mountains as they do. She was fostered from a young age by the Kujou Clan and has served since then as part of the Tenryou Commission.\nThe Tenryou Commission is one arm of the Tri-Commission, and is in charge of the security of Inazuma. Today, Sara is a general of the Tenryou Commission, and hers is the vital task of maintaining order within Inazuma City itself.\nShe governs well and is ever determined to set a good example for her subordinates. No matter how tough the issue, if it falls under the Tenryou Commission's jurisdiction, Sara can solve it in good time.\nSara smiles little and is swift and resolute in the pursuit of her missions, and so many Inazumans consider her an inaccessible, stone-cold military person.\nHowever, such an assessment might be too surface-level for someone like Sara, who seems cool on the outside but burns within.",
            "Character Story 1\tIn Inazuma, the Vision Hunt Decree is the manifestation of the Raiden Shogun's will to pursue Eternity, and Sara is the main enforcer of that decree.\nSara believes that Visions, in the hands of those with incorrectly-aligned minds, will destabilize the foundations of Inazuma, thus necessitating the Vision Hunt Decree.\nHowever, this does not mean that Sara will stoop to any means necessary to enforce it.\nWhen citizens are inevitably affected as the decree is carried out, she will expend the utmost patience and sincerity to attempt to explain the Almighty Shogun's long-term goals.\nShe has also given clear orders forbidding the harming or exploiting of civilians during the pursuit of the decree, as such evil deeds will only drag the great name of the Archon through the mud.\nUnfortunately, the vast ideals of the Archon are too great for mortals to perceive, and resentment arises nonetheless, with some even uniting to resist those who enforce the decree.\nIn such circumstances, where she has no choice but to take action, Sara often sighs helplessly before facing the enemy.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe Shogun's Army has Kujou Sara's leadership to thank in large part for the fearlessness and unity of its soldiery.\nSurveying battle lines, setting up training plans, selecting weapons and armor... Unlike many generals who prefer to strategize and plan from the rear, Sara prefers to do such things herself.\nSara is very harsh on herself during training, with her personal regimen being over ten times tougher than that which the ordinary troops go through. Even when night has fallen and the world has gone to sleep, one can still hear the sounds of her bow being drawn echoing through the dojo.\nOn the battlefield, she has always been at the tip of the spear, leading the troops with absolute heroism and awe-inspiring fighting spirit.\nWhen the dust has settled, she will also personally see to the wounded, and give reward and mete out punishment based on merit. Every step of the battle that passes through her hands is managed well, with missteps being very few and far between.\nSara's troops are all witnesses to her words and deeds. No one who has fought alongside her does not hold her in the highest regard.\nThe general is the soul of the army, and fine generals are hard to find. Small wonder, then, that Sara has always been the pride of the Shogun's Army.",
            "Character Story 3\tEven when she is not training, Sara brings her austere, strict nature into her daily life.\nHer life seems to follow some sort of eternal, unchanging rule. She wakes up on the dot, trains on the dot, eats a fixed amount...\nFrom things as large as training regimens to things as small as food consumption, Sara has her own perspective and pursues her self-created standards to the last letter.\n\"Miscellaneous objects are to be sorted by category, and furnishings are to be arrayed in straight lines. There is to neither be dirt in any corner, nor on the ground.\"\nThese are the standards Sara holds her dwelling up to.\nShe views excellence in such matters to also be a part of her training, and handles them herself, not requiring the aid of any servants.\nThat said, how could her servants ever just stand idly by? Every time they meet Sara, they will implore her to put the cleaning cloth down and leave the matter to them.\nHaving repeatedly declined their offers to no avail, Sara eventually took to cleaning up behind closed doors, posting up this sign outside her room—\n\"Training in Progress, Do Not Disturb.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tAlthough she has grown up amongst humans, Sara still maintains the various habits of the tengu. When she leaves the Tenryou Commission Headquarters on occasion, it is mostly to go to the mountains.\nShe knows them like the back of her hand, and has witnessed many strange creatures not often told of in human tales.\nAmong them are many fierce and evil things, but there are also little creatures that mean no harm. To Sara, however, these are just differences in form.\nThere was a time when a sizable spate of thefts was reported to the police station in quick succession, and they could not find the culprit. Walking through the woods on higher alert than usual, Sara quickly espied the bake-danuki running along hurriedly while carrying their plunder.\nOf course, bake-danuki are not evil by nature, but only steal food out of gluttony.\nCapturing the creatures, Sara had only this to say as she reclaimed their ill-gotten gains:\n\"Hiding in the mountains will not let you escape judgment. Listen closely, for this is your final warning. Do not make yourself a nuisance to civilians again, or else...\"\nThe bake-danuki were chilled to the bone, nodding as they balled up in a corner. After this, they would keep to that agreement and did not again do such ill.\nAs for the sharp-tongued Sara, she would bring various melons and fruits that could keep for a longer period up to the mountains while training there, making sure to deposit them in the bake-danuki's dwelling whenever she passed through.\nShe did not explain herself, and in any case, did not consider this any sort of gift. If she had to describe it... then perhaps a sort of consolation to those who had turned from an unrighteous path might be the best description for such things.",
            "Character Story 5\tSara has been training with the Shogun's Army ever since she was taken in by the Tenryou Commission. The soldiers actually thought that she was a boy at first due to her coming to train at an early age, and they took care of her very well.\nHaving been a little frightened of crowds at first, Sara became much more outgoing due to this warm reception, and would even play games with the other troops.\nHowever, the soldiers she played alongside were severely punished by the Clan Head, while she was merely given a cold chastening.\n\"Not following military law and neglecting your training... I did not take you in just to have you do such pointless things.\"\nSince then, Sara would be conscientious in maintaining a certain distance from others. Rather than blending in with the crowd, she sought first to attain surpassing martial prowess, bearing in mind at all times that she would someday take command.\n\"The Raiden Shogun's helper. An example to the Tenryou Commission. The pride of the Clan Head.\"\nNone of these three identities put her first in any way. But to Sara, this was her. She was a warrior whose being was calm and austerity.\nNo one ever told her that she should give herself more consideration, and Sara did not necessarily lack such concerns either.\nHer chains as an adopted child and the solitude of a non-human had always accompanied her mission and status.\nBut to stop due to such obstacles is the dilemma of the weak, and being Kujou Sara, her path would not end here. She would be the Electro Archon's staunchest adherent and the most clear-headed of her generals.",
            "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder\tOut of their worship and love for the Raiden Shogun, many merchants have created and sold artwork related to her.\nThe most popular product among them is the \"Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder,\" a lacquerware doll made using the deity's image as its template.\nSara rose early the day it went on the market, easily becoming first in the queue to purchase the statue. This became something of a hot topic for a while.\nSara would make no retort concerning any such stories. From her perspective, she bought that item with pious respect in her heart.\nIn all matters related to the Shogun, she had never once committed a perfunctory or negligent act. Indeed, she went forth personally to select and purchase a statue and even personally prepared a shrine within which it might be kept upon her return.\nShe placed five such statues in specially-placed display cases, and would clean them whenever she returned home. If she could not be there, she would arrange for artisans to perform that maintenance instead...\nTo someone like Sara who lacks friends and who is too busy to have much of a private life, the Raiden Shogun is not merely a deity, but also a form of repose.\nThe Shogun is her will, her future, her strength... even the harbinger of her fate — the confluence of all that is noble. Sara's adherence is one born out of recognition and trust.\nThe intricately-made Archon statue makes Sara feel like the Almighty Shogun is not far off in her Tenshukaku, but is a wisdom, an ideal, a strength of heart that supports her every step of the way.\nThese moments of tranquility bring her indescribable enjoyment.",
            "Vision\tWhen she obtained her Vision, she had not yet been given a name or surname.\nShe originally lived in a quiet mountain forest that had, from a time unknown, become plagued by great evils that robbed it of its former peace.\nThough she had the strength of the tengu, she was still young and could not stand against the monsters alone, and was hurled from a cliff during the battle, her wings having been damaged prior.\nPlummeting from the heights, and unable to unfurl her injured wings, she seemed fated to fall to her death.\n\"No! It can't end like this! I... I always believed that I could protect this place forever with my strength...\"\nWhen day dawned the next day, some passers-by discovered an unconscious girl by the roadside. She looked a little worse for the wear but seemed otherwise unharmed, adding to the mystery of how she had ended up here.\nAstonished, the people brought her back to the city and reported the matter to the Tenryou Commission immediately.\nThat was when the Kujou Clan Head, Kujou Takayuki, noticed that the glowing item in her hand was a Vision — a thing that many desired but few ever gained.\nRealizing that she this child had gained the attention of an Archon even at her young age, Takayuki believed that she was a destined child, sent to the Tenryou Commission by the heavens.\nTaking her in, he named her \"Sara,\" and would train her to become an all-around warrior, asking that she serve the Shogun and fight for Inazuma.\nKujou Takayuki believed that in raising such an excellent general, the status and future of the Kujou Clan would become more secure. And indeed, all that he had hoped would steadily come to pass.\nSara, armed with her Vision, would swiftly distinguish herself, rising through the ranks to become a general of the Tenryou Commission at a young age, just as many had hoped.\nYet it was precisely because she possessed a Vision that Sara knew this better than anyone: her surviving that fall unscathed was due to the Archon looking upon her with favor in that instant.\nIn but a single glance, she had been given the power that sustained her life. Everything she had, therefore, could be described as existing by the Almighty Shogun's grace.\nFighting for the Shogun...\nSara believed that this was neither her duty nor a result of her foster father's schemes, but was instead her truest calling."

I know outsiders don't think very highly of the Arataki Gang, and the members themselves don't really care what others think. But, I still want to strive to change the impression we leave.

That was common wisdom, after all.\nCertifications serve as excellent proof of one's efforts, and are convincing ways of scoring points upon introduction — very useful things indeed.\nAfter easily getting a couple of such certificates, Shinobu finally reckoned that she could add a little color to her presently-blank namecard.\nUnfortunately, this process proved to feature pitfalls of its own: out of curiosity and in an effort to test herself, she had gotten a whole load of certifications in one go, causing the prefix section of her namecard to balloon uncontrollably.\n\"Junior Chef, Tailor, Actuary, Health Manager, Human Resource Manager...\"\nHaving lots of skills is not a bad thing, but there is such a thing of having too many skills, lest one struggle in the snare of figuring out one's titles, like Shinobu did.\nTo this day, Shinobu cannot remember how many namecards she has made.\nBut ever since she joined the Arataki Gang, her very first title has always been \"Deputy.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tAfter tasting Kuki Shinobu's very own Roasted Lavender Melon, the Arataki Gang all wept and exclaimed that they never knew that Lavender Melons could be so delicious when roasted.\nAnd the flavor, too, was most different from that which had been produced by any other method they had ever tried. Could it be that high-class culinary exams also taught people how to cook Lavender Melons a certain way?\nFaced with such a question, Shinobu put the melon she was grilling down before slowly telling a story.\nAt that time, she had gone to far-off Liyue to study law, and would visit this place known as Wanmin Restaurant in her free time.\nThe food there was incredibly diverse and made in unique ways, with ingenious ideas that surprised her, despite the fact that she had already obtained a high-level culinary license at the time.\nFrom slivers of stir-fried meat immersed in sauce to boiled cabbage with the fragrance of chicken soup... Indeed, the world was wide and full of wonders.\nAnd though one might be acquainted with every profession and be certified highly in every one, it is never wise to rest on one's laurels. Indeed, it is only by daring to try and make breakthroughs that one can surpass the limits set down by those who came before.\nThe Arataki Gang did not understand this in full, but they cheered all the same, for there was no harm in that — and their cheers certainly did the melons' flavor little harm.\nSeeing how they greatly enjoyed their meals, Shinobu kept the ending of the story to herself.\nBack then, the sous chef of Wanmin Restaurant had heard her say these words, and had urged Chef Mao to bring out the Salt and Pepper Slime...\nSuch food, she knew, would never appear in any culinary exam anywhere in the world.\nNor would the Arataki Gang want to learn that Shinobu had slathered slime ooze onto Lavender Melons as sauce before grilling them...",
            "Character Story 3\tThe Kuki Clan is a family of shrine maidens, a tradition that spans generations. Members of that family regard service to Narukami as a great honor.\nThis too was the case with her generation. After her sister Miyuki was sent to the Grand Shrine, she was also sent there from a young age as an understudy.\nOf course, a great store of rules and regulations came with this time-honored tradition: for example, how many days to fast to show one's sincerity and resolve, or how many ablutions were to be performed to avoid profaning the divine...\nNo one ever explained where these rules had come from or how they had been decided. She was simply told that they had existed since way back, and thus were to be followed.\nWhen Shinobu first arrived at the shrine, she would sometimes catch a chill from staying on the mountain at night. At this time, her family lived far from the shrine and her sister was out on an errand far afield.\nA strong-willed child, she did not ask the other shrine maidens for help, but would instead pluck thorned plants one by one, alone, before twining them around her body.\nAccording to a traditional saying, this deed would earn you the protection of Narukami and remove the illness from you. So she went on twining that loop of thorns, even as she whispered prayers to Narukami for protection deep into the night, shivering all the while.\nHowever, when the night was over, her chill was not cured. All she had earned instead was a tingling red mark around herself.\nAs the days passed, Shinobu would find again and again that the rules were not as foolproof as the ancients might have made them out to be, nor was the role of a shrine maiden quite as indispensable as they had claimed back home.\nWell then, didn't that mean that the very necessity of the Kuki Clan to become shrine maidens was also up for renegotiation?\nSome years later, Shinobu had already left the shrine for some time now, and with time to kill, she would flip through a book on herbology.\nWithin its pages, she found that it clearly, indeed vividly, described how the mountainous thorns had paralytic properties that could render birds and beasts unable to move, and that it was this property that led the ancients to include them into medicine to ameliorate topical aches and pains.\nShe was, well... speechless.\nShinobu thought to herself that yes, perhaps rules did have rhyme or reason behind them, but to treat the rules as reason in themselves must be treated as an obsolete practice.\nOn further reflection, she could not help but feel that she was happier living her current life.",
            "Character Story 4\tTo find work through which she might truly have freedom, Kuki Shinobu once declined all manner of respectable job offers, only agreeing to being hired as part-time outsourced staff.\nOne of these commissions came from an old lacquerware professional who had accidentally thrown his hip out of whack. The job itself was no challenge to Shinobu, bearer of an advanced certification in this field, but the address of the client was... well, a little special.\nWhen she brought the newly-maintained figurine to the Police Station, she ran into a petty thief who was making their escape from that site who, fleeing at all speed as they were, rammed right into her, sending the doll sailing into the air.\nSeeing that several days' work was about to go down the gutter, Shinobu struck out like lightning, seizing the figurine with one hand before whirling about and tripping the suspect.\nAll at once the surrounding people surged forward, subduing the crook. Afterward, Kujou Sara — seemingly the person who had placed this order — would come and thank her personally.\nAs for the goods, they were perfectly unharmed, much to Sara's surprise — to think that someone in the lacquerware business could have such martial skill!\nAfter learning of Shinobu's circumstances and her desire to \"find a job that gives her real freedom,\" Sara would consider for a moment before inviting Shinobu to join the Tenryou Commission.\n\"Hmm... No, I think I'll pass. The civil service seems a bit too limiting for me...\" At this point, Shinobu hesitated. \"But if those legal lectures and martial arts training could be done part-time, I will definitely consider the offer.\"\nFrom that day on, Shinobu would begin a new slew of part-time work.\nOne thing did surprise her, though — the general of the Tenryou Commission would always attend her lectures and demonstrations.\n\"It is only right that those who enforce the law should better understand it,\" so Sara said with perfect earnestness.\n\"The opportunity to test myself against similarly-skilled warriors is also not one I get often,\" Shinobu replied.\nSara's straightforward personality and decisive behavior were things Shinobu greatly approved of, and it was through this — and through Sara hiring her often to maintain figurines — that the two would quickly become friends.\nSara would also repeat her offer of employment several times, only for Shinobu to decline each time. Yet, this \"job that brings true freedom\" was not something she would find, either.\nThat is, until one day, when Sara wound up arriving late to the izakaya where they had arranged, as they often did, to meet and have figurines change hands, leaving Shinobu to drink till midnight.\n\"That's unexpected. I didn't think you could be late at all, Sara.\"\n\"Sorry. I was held up by a really rowdy gang...\"\n\"A gang? And what gang could have troubled you that much?\"\n\"Well, I wouldn't call them 'trouble' exactly. They call themselves the Arataki Gang...\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe news that the Arataki Gang now had a second-in-command raised a decent (though ultimately small) stir in Hanamizaka.\nIt was rumored that this deputy was well-versed in etiquette, law, and was quite the dab hand physically as well, bringing the other members to heel within a few days of arriving.\nThose who had witnessed this deputy's actions first hand were full of praise for them, saying that at long last, the Arataki Gang had someone polite and reasonable added to their ranks.\nSome did worry about this development, however: the Arataki Gang was, after all, not a proper organization by any measure.\nThe little hullabaloos they had caused in the past were nothing, really, but with the arrival of someone who could be the \"brains\" of the organization, who might put some discipline into them... Could this not also be the harbinger of worse incidents to come?\nNot to mention the Gang's daily operations... Other than logistics and transportation, home repair, and performance, they now added tax agency, legal consultation, event management and various other operations that both involved sizable capital investments and a not-insignificant air of danger to them.\nSurely they weren't intending to do all these things without the right licenses... right?\nAnd never mind the licenses, first — if they were to commit fraud in any of these newly-added businesses, they would surely be arrested by the Tenryou Commission!\nHowever, these wild guesses and ill-omened rumors would quickly be dispelled. The Arataki Gang's actions afterward were more than enough to show that they were still a gang of their word.\nThose who have attempted to enlist their new financial services have indeed seen their situations turned right around, and the transparency and uprightness of their processes have been stunning.\nOf course, it is also a pity that the Gang remains the Gang. The children of Hanamizaka still live in fear of Arataki Itto coming to win their snacks off them come dinner time, and often still return to their homes fuming.\nIn any case, it seems that even this legendary second-in-command will take a long time to reform the Arataki Gang's more... unbound ways.",
            "Oni Mask\tKuki Shinobu had yet to wear her mask when she first joined the Arataki Gang.\nWhile pursuing a certain business prospect, Shinobu was busy engaging in some serious talks. The other members of the gang were arrayed behind her in a single row, hands behind their backs and unsmiling.\n\"Just stay like that and don't say anything,\" Shinobu had instructed them to do so on short notice. \"This is the most effective way of negotiating... For you guys, anyway.\"\nThe talks were going exactly as Shinobu expected, until a passing child suddenly pointed at her, exclaiming:\n\"Mama, mama, look! That's the shrine maiden who never smiled back at the Grand Shrine! Wow, she looks so cool!\"\nThe child was whisked away by her panicked mother, but the quick departure did not change the mottled embarrassment and resignation on her face, as if she could not wait to flee for the hills and forests right that instant.\nAs for Itto's face, it was as if two onikabuto were wrestling for dominance upon it. Genta and the others, try as they might, ultimately lost their poker faces amidst gales of guffaws.\nThe next martial demonstration would, of course, see their faces beaten so hard that they were redder than Shinobu's was at that moment. If only they had known their fate, perhaps they might not have laughed quite so hard.\nFrom that day on, Shinobu would sport that mask. Pitch-black and claws bared, it lent her a positively demonic aspect.\nBy the way, it was also that martial demonstration that served as the origin of her moniker \"the demonic deputy\".",
            "Vision\tThe day she left the shrine, Kuki Shinobu left all the things that she possessed while serving as a shrine maiden behind at home, starting over from the most basic of belongings.\nAs such, she knew immediately that the bag she lifted was not the right weight. Hadn't she only left towels inside it?\nReaching into the bag and fishing about, she pulled out, of all things, a glittering Vision, its loveliness so striking such that her sister, Miyuki, could not help but gasp.\nAn irony it was indeed that the shrine maiden who was fleeing her duties would receive a Vision for doing just that.\nThis, of course, was the very first \"certification\" that Shinobu would receive — from a god, certifying her freedom.\nIndeed, Miyuki, who had intended to stop her at first, had a change of heart upon witnessing this sign, agreeing to help convince their parents.\n...It was also due to this that she would willingly surrender her Vision while the Vision Hunt Decree was ongoing.\nFor one thing, she did not intend to make life difficult for her friend in the Tenryou Commission, but for the other, the Vision was but one of her many, many certificates.\nMost things in life could, in any case, be settled without the use of a Vision, nor could the truly obdurate problems be dismissed simply by the dint of that device.\nRemoving generations worth of prejudice, for example, or searching for true, unbound freedom.\n...Or, you know, stopping those dolts in the Arataki Gang from chomping at the bit to \"help\" her win her Vision back."

            "Character Details\tThe Rtawahist Darshan of the six Darshans under the Sumeru Akademiya is dedicated to the study of Illuminationism.\nEach of the Six Darshans focuses on a different field of study. Illuminationism, then, is centered around astrology and astronomy, learning of the cosmos that has clutched the world in its embrace since time immemorial.\nIt is among the researchers of Illuminationism that we find Layla.\nThough she has only recently enrolled, she has already earned a great many nicknames for herself.\nShe has been called the Sleepwalking Eccentric, the Human Calculator, and even the Heaven-Sent Thesis by those who know her.\nAs the days go by, her titles only seem to grow in number.",
            "Character Story 1\tThere are two kinds of people in the halls of Akademiya:\nThe first holds themselves with an air of calmness and mastery. Be it experimentation or dissertation, this type of person always makes whatever they're doing look easy.\nThe other kind of person wears their woes on their faces. Sighs spill from their lips as mournful notes while they clutch their tools, looking lost. Intermittently, they will jot something down before slashing it out, battling themselves all the way.\nLayla belongs to the latter category.\nBeing poor of health and bereft of sleep is not uncommon among researchers, but Layla takes it to a whole other level. The bags of exhaustion hanging beneath her eyes and weariness burned across her features make it impossible for her to hide the stress gnawing at her.\nShould someone approach her, they will often hear her whispering things like \"I don't understand,\" or \"why,\" and even whimpering \"I'm doomed.\" These lamentations often earn her looks of sympathy.\nThe halls of Akademiya exist not just as the altar of knowledge to dedicated students but also as the source of their nightmares. Countless among their number have suffered failed experiments and watched their dissertations get torn apart. Rumor has it that, unable to bear the rigors and pressures of school, many students each year choose to depart before they graduate, quitting before their journey is complete.\nAt first glance, Layla might seem like she hangs on the edge of departing herself, but in actuality, she has already outlasted several classmates who enrolled in the same year as her.\nWhen seeking knowledge, talent is useful, but perseverance is essential.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe reasons behind Layla's poor physical health and insomnia can be traced back to a single factor: academic pressure.\nAll students of the Darshans are required to commit to their studies, complete their essays, and pass their examinations or dissertations. Though this task sounds simple, simple does not mean easy, and the investment demanded of students comes in the form of time and effort.\nUnfortunately for Layla, she is always slower at finishing her papers than her peers.\nShe often spends a great deal of time contemplating, and worrying about the validity of her theses. Is the content overly simplistic compared to that written by her classmates? Are her calculations truly accurate? And if so, are they as concise as they can be?\nShe feels that, as a student of a most prestigious Darshan, she cannot slack in her studies. But at the same time, she dares not commit to her writings in haste.\nSeized by hesitation, time often slips from between her fingers, and leaves her staring at the blank pages of her work without having written a word.\nBecause of this, she often finds herself working through the night, and leaving sleep for the day. Yet, with the breaking of dawn, she often finds herself assailed by new assignments, causing her to descend into a vicious spiral.\nAs such, her habits have afflicted her body with abnormal side effects.\nNow, she often rises at night, wandering. Upon waking, she often finds herself unable to remember what she had done or where she had gone — the rumored symptoms of the phenomenon known as \"sleepwalking,\" described by her peers.\nFrom how her classmates have described her sleepwalking, it is as if she suddenly manifests with neither hint nor reason in a certain place. Mysteriously, none of them have been able to fully explain where she goes after or what she does either.\nBesides sleepwalking, she has also discovered another strange recurrence in her life.\nEach time she awakes from sleepwalking, she finds her unwritten papers from the day before fully completed, meticulous and accurate calculations included! Even the handwriting appears to be hers.\nStranger still, the author of her papers also has a habit of viciously critiquing the arguments and experimental methods of others.\nLayla simply could not fathom herself committing these acts, and found herself suspecting that someone was messing with her.\nHowever, upon recalling her experiences leading from her home to the halls of the Darshan, she could think of no one with proper motive.\nThe term \"Heaven-Sent Thesis\" is often used in Sumeru to describe an impossible miracle... and if what Layla had been experiencing did not count as a \"Heaven-Sent Thesis,\" she didn't know what did.\nDid a miracle truly grace her? Did the stars themselves, moved by her dedication to the study, repay her with a blessing?\nRegardless, \"The Stars' Blessing\" has solved several of her woes. Now, the papers she needs to write for several classes can be handed in without additional worry on her end.\nAs for the other details, well, that is probably best left for when she had the energy to care. Presently, she has classes to prepare for.",
            "Character Story 3\tAfter pushing through her heavy backlog of assignments, even Layla will find time to decompress.\nIn her spare time, she enjoys heading to Port Ormos by boat to wander its streets. There, traveling merchants and vagabonds place their stalls and practice their trades, offering all manner of interesting trinkets and showcasing amazing skills, infusing the perpetually exhausted Layla with a sense of refreshment.\nShe has witnessed the folk of the desert testing themselves in thrilling challenges of agility as they score bull's-eyes through distantly placed apples with thrown daggers.\nShe met a strange individual who claimed to be capable of flight; using a mere carpet, they managed to levitate off the ground.\nYet, the one who left the deepest impression on her was a stall owner that invited passersby to participate in a game of luck. Upon his stall, he separated colorful pages worth varying rewards into wooden boxes. In a display of astonishing speed and agility, the owner would shift these boxes about and shuttle them from position to position. Afterward, he would ask those participating in his lottery to pick a box.\nDespite not managing to claim the grand prize during her first few attempts, after a few more tries, Layla began to notice a pattern.\nThough the stall owner possessed blinding hand speed, she realized that his left thumb barely moved during the shuffling process.\nHence, she realized the box nearest to his left them would experience the least amount of deviations to its position.\nAfter achieving such comprehension, Layla managed to repeatedly win the grand prize. When the curious stall owner discovered how Layla used her insight to peer beyond the mirage of his speed, he found himself overcome with admiration for the girl and offered her a generous bonus reward.\nFor Layla, the reward was a thing of secondary importance. The true pleasure she got was getting to behold the awesome skills that other people possessed.\nUnlike the conservatives in the Akademiya, she did not look down upon the arts and trades of those who worked in the streets. Instead, she was thankful to all the vendors of Port Ormos for the happy memories they granted her.",
            "Character Story 4\tAs her first year in the Akademiya came to an end, Layla listed down her strengths and weaknesses, planning to write a personal assessment for herself.\nShe possessed good observation and estimation skills, and was consistently capable of tracking the shifting position of the cosmos via the star charts at twice the speed of her peers.\nAdditionally, she considered her skill in mathematics to be acceptable. When faced with simple questions, she could calculate the answers in a blink of an eye without even needing to do the equations in written form.\nBefore ever entering the halls of Akademiya, Layla had a chance encounter with her future mentor. Her mentor had complimented her then, stating that she was a child blessed by the stars with the thirst and capacity to seek true knowledge.\nIt was these virtues that gave her the courage and hope to seek education and wisdom in the Akademiya.\nHowever, upon stepping foot into the Darshan, she found that her strengths were paltry when compared to her peers of a similar age.\nOnly the best of the best could make it into the Darshans, and as such, Layla couldn't help but feel a bit overshadowed.\nAs for shortcomings, Layla found them to be too many to count. For example, her habit of fixating on problems afflicted her with a great deal of indecisiveness.\nMoreover, her ability to socialize was also lacking. When involved in discussions, she often struck others as aloof and arrogant due to her reluctance in expressing her views, which led to her having few friends in the Darshan.\nWhat diminished her confidence even further was the fact that among the many papers she has submitted, few were actually written by her. Instead, they were byproducts of having \"The Stars' Blessing.\"\nFrom Layla's perspective, she is an insignificant individual.\nWhat she does not know is that her teachers and peers have an entirely different perspective of her.\n\"Hey, being mysterious and eccentric comes with being a genius.\"\n\"How does she draw her star charts so fast while we're doing in-field surveys? Are her eyes kameras? Wait, she's done with the stellar orbits as well?\"\n\"I have reviewed her papers and calculations and found the work to be rigorous and thorough. Her logic is ironclad. And some of her ideas are so intricate that I, even as an educator, am surprised. We have a fantastic student on our hands.\"\nSome people will always tread forward through life weighed down by their caution. Viewing themselves as lacking, they will nevertheless strive on despite the misgivings they have toward themselves.\nPerhaps it is also this perpetual dissatisfaction that spurs them onward, allowing them to surpass their fellows without even noticing.",
            "Character Story 5\tThere was a girl who was determined, smart, and modest. Maybe even a little too modest.\nShe always felt that her meager gifts placed her leagues away from achieving true mastery.\nStill, she yearned for excellence, wanting to stand side by side with the greatest of minds, to make her teachers and family proud.\nContradictory desires chained her: She was unwilling to let go and unveil her true self, but also did not want to suffer the drudgery of a mundane life.\nWith the passage of time, she felt overwhelmed by a barrage of emotions. Shame. Listlessness. Yearning. All these things weighed upon her psyche and exacted their toll. Eventually, her soul found itself in need of a small outlet. Something to give her some breathing room.\nWhile her body and mind are awake and aware, she is too chained by woes to be free. So, it is when she slumbers that her deeper desires come alive to inhabit her vessel instead, indulging in bursts of short-lived freedom, gorging herself on all the expressions and indulgences that she denied herself while awake.\nWhile sleepwalking, she is beyond the claws of self-doubt and depression, allowing her to easily overcome things like writing papers, drawing star charts, and making Starlogs. Matters that usually mire her in indecision and worry become simple, allowing her to pour out her innermost insights and challenge highly complex questions.\nThis is the release of her long-held desires. But all dreams must come to an end. As her body wakes, she again returns to being the insecure, introverted girl that she was before. Indeed, after awakening, she can't even fathom that the wittily written papers and intricately calculated equations were created by her own hands.\nAs she is determined and modest while conscious, so too is she sharp and smart while sleepwalking. Both sides belong to the same girl.\nLike a sapling in growth, she is torn between self-doubt and the desire to break free. This imbalance was how her sleepwalking manifested in the first place. Yet, no matter which side of her is in control at the moment, the part that is Layla always remains.",
            "Layla's Photo Book\tBesides the hills of notes, star charts, and journals, Layla's desk also has a thick book filled to the brim with photos.\nNo matter what else occupies the space on her desk, her photo book will always take the most visible spot.\nThe photos that fill the pages of this book were personally taken by Layla. It contains pictures of her home and parents, her friends, and even the mentor who inspired her to get into the Akademiya in the first place.\nEach photo is a snapshot of significance to Layla. She uses these photos in place of a journal, detailing her experiences and trials that led her from her home to the Akademiya.\nEach time she goes through her collage of photos, she finds herself still able to remember the burning determination from her past and uses it to pierce through encroaching bouts of doubt.\nRecently, Layla added a new picture she had taken with a certain gold-haired Traveler. As the pictures accumulate one after another, who knows how thick the book might get by the time she finally graduates?",
            "Vision\tLayla, being a person of easy temperament, rarely gets into arguments with others. One time, however, she broke the norm and found herself engaged in a heated debate.\nDuring a discussion for a class on Theoretical Astrology, an esteemed Herbad skimmed over Layla and her classmates' papers, and then began to harshly criticize some of Layla's arguments.\nIn the opinion of the Herbad, Theoretical Astrology is a sacred field of study with laws and theories that have been long crystallized by the expertise of countless researchers across the ages and cemented irrefutably by generations of testing and calculations. For Layla to question and even dare to correct some of these pre-accepted notions was tantamount to blasphemy.\nLayla did not respond to the criticism in the heat of the moment, however. Instead, she listed her detailed arguments in a report after the seminar and submitted it to the Herbad.\nNot long after, the Herbad attached his refutation to Layla's report and returned it to her.\nBy this point, most students would choose to accept the status quo. In one respect, failing to get a passing score for their seminar report will result in major negative effects on their finals.\nFurthermore, it was most presumptuous for a student to argue matters of academic validity with a Herbad, for any Herbad was far more refined than a mere student, whether it be in terms of knowledge and seniority, after all.\nPerhaps the arguments Layla made questioning long-accepted doctrine were simply results of a miscalculation on her part, and she might have been humiliated in the end on account of being mistaken.\nEven so, she did not give up. She continued her discourse with the Herbad using her reports. Then, with the passing of half a year, the Herbad went to find Layla once more. He admitted then that after consulting more researchers, he had discovered a point of non-acceptability in the long-accepted doctrines that had been left unexamined by the broader community.\nAs he concluded his explanations, he told Layla with pride and emotion that the students who dared challenge him for the sake of knowledge have grown fewer by the year.\nThe inception of education, for student or Herbad alike, is to seek knowledge in its purest form. Layla, in her persistence, had reminded him, at length, of this pursuit of enlightenment.\nAfter the conclusion of the seminars, as Layla was going through the bag that held the documents she had accrued during her exchanges with the Herbad, she spontaneously discovered a gleaming Vision in the bag's depths.\nIt lay there upon a thick stack of notes, like a fallen star pressed into the pages."

In addition to her elegance and charm, Lisa is also highly educated.\nShe is said to have been the most talented sorceress to study at the Sumeru Akademiya in the last two centuries.\nIt is known that Lisa chose to return to Mondstadt after two years of advanced study in Sumeru, but the reason for her decision is not.",
            "Character Story 1\tLisa is tasked with managing and maintaining the vast collection of books in the Knights of Favonius library, as well as ensuring that their potions are always fully stocked.\nThe only time that the citizens of Mondstadt see Lisa is when lending or returning library books.\nIn both scenarios, they tend to encounter Lisa sitting at the counter like a languid cat, yawning as she signs books in and out.\nAt times, her behavior causes people to doubt whether she is really up to the task of being librarian for the illustrious Knights of Favonius.\nNevertheless, it appears that she performs every task flawlessly, as her work consistently stands up to scrutiny.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe fact that Cyrus of the Sumeru Akademiya frequently refers to Lisa as their \"best student in two hundred years\" is all that needs to be said about Lisa's accomplishments in her studies.\nFrom outlandish forbidden knowledge, to the handling of elementally infused flora, to the most efficient methods of distilling wine... where there is a body of knowledge, the chances are that Lisa is acquainted with it.\nThis, paired with her ability to explain things clearly and concisely, makes Lisa the sensible person to approach for young knights and alchemists with burning questions.\nThat is, provided they go and see her at an acceptable hour.\nTo visit during unacceptable hours — such as in the morning while Lisa is sleeping in, or in the afternoon while she's enjoying her tea — can spell disaster for unsuspecting visitors.",
            "Character Story 3\tWhen people meet Lisa for the first time, they often find themselves overawed by the famous alumna of Sumeru Akademiya.\nHowever, though her attitude to life may appear at first to be one of ruthless efficiency, it is in fact better understood as a product of her incorrigibly lazy nature, which drives her to avoid troublesome issues at all costs.\nBy negotiating with Kaeya, she offloaded the job of restocking and dispensing medication to Huffman and Swan, and had Flora start sending Donna over to deliver herbs on a daily basis.\nThe only tasks that Lisa handles personally are the categorization and management of books and other documents.\nThis is the one area where Lisa feels more comfortable handling the work herself rather than delegating it.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen Lisa first joined the Knights of Favonius, the Grand Master sought to appoint her as Captain of the 8th Company.\nThis was much to the consternation of the company's Field Officer, Nymph, who resented the idea of an academic coming in at such a high-ranking position.\nAt Kaeya's suggestion, a practice combat session was arranged in which Lisa and Nymph would both display their magical proficiency.\nTwo minutes into the session, Lisa graciously declined the captaincy on the grounds that \"Nymph manifestly possesses the requisite ability to fulfill the role.\"\nFor the whole year following, the Grand Master received a constant stream of referral letters from Nymph in relation to the captaincy, and the only person ever named in them was Lisa Minci.\nEventually, the Grand Master began turning over the referral letters to Lisa directly, but every time, Lisa would come up with an excuse to decline the offer.\nUndoubtedly, the 8th Company would have been far stronger under her lead, but she deemed that such a level of power was not only superfluous to requirements, it would also be risky for her in a way that most people could never appreciate.\nTo be clear, Lisa is quite confident that she could handle any situation she came up against. However, additional danger means an additional workload — and that is something that she would never be able to accept.",
            "Character Story 5\tHaving personally witnessed raving-mad scholars in the forests of Sumeru and powerful sages sitting underutilized on advisory councils, Lisa realized what uninhibited erudition can really do to a person.\nIt seemed such a high price to pay... How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge of all?\nPut off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.\nSince then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously.\n\"Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask.\"\nThese words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt. In each case, it was because she knew it was what they needed to hear.",
            "Special Heating Cauldron\tThe Special Heating Cauldron is a purpose-built cauldron made to a design that no one in Mondstadt could understand. It features time-delay heating, semi-automated ingredient insertion, and temperature regulation functions.\nLisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.\nShe boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.\nBut her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.\nAfter all, a relaxing afternoon tea session is by far the most important part of Lisa's day.",
            "Vision\tA Vision is a sign from the gods: a sign that you are one of those whom they have chosen to change the world.\nOr, maybe it's just one of the many hoops that one has to jump through on the path to unearthing the secrets of magecraft.\nAfter all, understanding the elements is essential to the study of magic, and practical experience is a far more useful means of acquiring this understanding than trying to assimilate the knowledge contained in dusty old books.\n\"Hmm... I suppose I shall need a Vision, then.\"\nAnd just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.\nWith the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.\nFor whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.\nThe Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.\nSo, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.\nPerhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions."

            "Hello\tMika, Front-Line Land Surveyor, Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company, reporting in. It's an honor to fight alongside you. If there's anything I can do to support you, just let me know and I'll get to it right away. Anyway, I'll make every effort to navigate us safely and report accurate intel on the enemy!",
            "Chat: Staying on Target\tWe'd better stay battle ready... Our next mission could start at any time.",
            "Chat: Situation Report\tVerifying our current position, measuring distance to target area... Alright, I've recorded the terrain conditions.",
            "Chat: Establishing a Route\tNo matter what kind of environment you may find yourself in, with thorough reconnaissance, you should be able to establish a safe route.",
            "When It Rains\tAhh, the rain is really coming down... let's just hope the conditions out here won't get too muddy. Otherwise, I'll need to help everyone clean their boots, and there won't be enough time to prepare a meal...",
            "When Thunder Strikes\tThunder can mask the sound of movement, which is why it's our friend.",
            "When It Snows\tFreshly fallen snow may be beautiful, but it masks the more nuanced features of terrain, which can be a pain.",
            "When the Sun Is Out\tThe sun is out and visibility is excellent... Perfect conditions for observation. Couldn't ask for anything better!",
            "When the Wind Is Blowing\tHuh... Could this wind be a sign from the Anemo Archon? Or is it just a result of the terrain's effects on the atmosphere...",
            "Good Morning\tOh, good morning! ...I prepared the breakfast we usually eat in the expeditionary force. If you don't mind, maybe you could tell me our plan of action for today while you eat.",
            "Good Afternoon\tOh, please wait a moment, our meal's almost ready! Field ration no.3 — it's the Reconnaissance Company's favorite. I'll check the nearby area again shortly to see if there are any suitable places for a short rest.",
            "Good Evening\tDinner's served! Although it's just some basic field rations, it should still have all the nutrients you need. Please, dig in... If you have any equipment that needs maintenance, you can also give them to me.",
            "Good Night\tIt's getting late, and I need to get the day's survey records in order. The camp beds are ready, so why don't you have a rest? After you've recovered your energy, our midnight snack should also be ready, and we can trade posts.",
            "About Mika: Work\tHmm? What's a Front-Line Land Surveyor? Well, my duty is to scout ahead into unknown territory, survey the terrain, and identify key locations. Sometimes, we also have to deal with enemy sentries, so in addition to being able to map out the terrain, I also have to stay combat ready, know first aid, and have strong survival skills...",
            "About Mika: Mundane Tasks\tMaking camp, starting a fire, cooking food, and maintaining equipment... these are all essential tasks that must be done. If the others dislike such duties, and if I can uh, manage them to a satisfactory degree, then the least I can do is to help out... That way, everyone can have a breather and relax a little...",
            "About Us: Rumors\tAh, sorry... I heard all about you when I first arrived back in Mondstadt. Super powerful people like you and Paimon usually have some kind of strict personal code. Since many super powerful people would also have a bad temper, I was afraid that if I misspoke, you might get upset. But luckily, you two are really nice, and I have nothing to worry about!",
            "About Us: Speaking in Code\tSome forward scouts will use the word \"Octave\" to indicate that they've run out of arrows and are returning to camp... Or \"Vera\" to mean \"the conditions are good, we should engage the enemy\"... Hey, why don't we also come up with some code words? It'll come in handy, especially if we'll be working together long term. Go ahead, I'm good with any of your ideas!",
            "About the Vision\tTo be honest, even I was amazed that I managed to receive a Vision. It's really come in handy, but I shouldn't completely rely on its powers. Instead, I prefer to think of it as a sort of safeguard to use in case something happens. As a member of the Knights of Favonius, I should place more importance on team cooperation, and come up with ways to overcome difficulties together with my teammates.",
            "Something to Share\tHere's a simple survey trick that you might find useful... Stretch out your arm, and raise your thumb towards the target area. Align your right eye's line of sight and your thumb to the left side of the target, and your left eye to the right side of the target, and multiply the distance between the two sides by the right multiplier... You can use this trick to estimate the height of a mountain and whether it's climbable, or the width of a river and whether you can swim across.",
            "Interesting Things\tI heard Klee mention that there's a type of plant that can relay sound... if only we could somehow carry this plant with us in the field. That way, I could instantly report back about the terrain... I could even stay near the front lines and guide our rear forces to attack enemy targets from afar with volleys of arrows.",
            "About Kaeya\tBefore joining the Knights, I had to take a number of exams. Captain Kaeya was the main person in charge of all the testing. He was really supportive, and gave me all kinds of tips, but sometimes, I would struggle to understand what he was saying... I would get worried that I was not keeping up with his pace, and that I was letting him down...",
            "About Varka: Instruction\tGrand Master Varka is not only a strong leader who commands respect, but also my personal combat instructor. He taught me to think on my feet and avoid engaging enemies at close combat to make up for my small stature and relative lack of stamina. Following his advice, I learned how to fight with a polearm and crossbow, and I must say, this fighting style is far more suitable to me.",
            "About Varka: The Captain\tThe Grand Master said that I need to set higher goals for myself, and strive to achieve them. I've always had that kind of attitude, but it wasn't until I was on the expedition that I realized how serious things can become... One day, I met the Fatui Harbinger known as The Captain. I can't even begin to imagine how I can deal with an opponent like him. I just... Such powerful people are really on a level of their own, I'm not even remotely close...",
            "About Jean\tThe Deputy... I mean, the Acting Grand Master is a strong and considerate leader who always makes me feel at ease. She's always out there looking after all of us. Whether it's organizing work, rendering first aid, or cooking delicious meals, there's so much I can learn from her...",
            "About Amber\tOh? Amber the Outrider? She's the most reliable vanguard, and has amazing reconnaissance skills! The roles of Front-Line Surveyors and the Outriders are similar given that we both operate ahead of the main force. Amber has a lot of experience, and I've learned a lot of survival skills from her, as well as how to better maintain my crossbow strings and arrows.",
            "About Eula: Tasks\tCaptain Eula is a strong fighter with a combat style of her own, and she's always looked out for me. When I first joined the company, she assigned me a variety of tasks, way more than what other members had, and that quickly improved my ability to adapt. Once I grew accustomed to the way she expresses herself, I was able to work together with her just fine!",
            "About Eula: Daily Conduct\tActually, I really admire Captain Eula. She is friendly and free-spirited, and her mental fortitude is out of this world. If other people gave me strange looks all the time and talked behind my back like they do about her, I don't think I'd be able to leave my room...",
            "About Lisa\tOur librarian Lisa had always offered her help when I was first teaching myself how to draw maps. She even found a bunch of useful books for me to study. *sigh* If only I could be as well-learned as she is... After all, it never hurts to have more knowledge, and you never know when you might need it...",
            "About Klee\tOh? Klee? She's super cheerful, and I've heard that... she's as strong as the Grand Master himself. She's invited me to go on adventures with her before, and we always had a great time together! Although she would experiment with dangerous weapons from time to time, which means I've had to revise my maps on several occasions... But I still feel it's worth it!",
            "About Venti\tI really like that bard... He's a very talented performer, and his melodies always seem to make me feel at home. If I had to pick a tune that best represents Mondstadt, it'd definitely be one of his. It's too bad that I'm not often in the city, otherwise, I could bring him some gifts every day...",
            "About Albedo\tThe Chief Alchemist has been very kind to me. He helped me make all the survey equipment I use in the field... I even have some pens he made that will work even when I'm hanging upside down from a tree. But it seems that making artistic sketches is quite different from making maps. I've tried to make some sketches of a target area as supplemental intel before, and word has it that Captain Albedo went silent for a long time when he saw them...",
            "More About Mika: I\tHmm? You want to know more about me? Well, I'm just an ordinary person, so I don't really have any interesting stories... I guess all I could talk about is my experiences, would you be willing to hear about that?",
            "More About Mika: II\tEver since I was a kid, I've wanted to become a cartographer, and map out every corner of Teyvat. It's only later on that I discovered the Knights of Favonius actually have that kind of role. Thanks to my father and brother's support, I was able to make it through the selection process and become a Front-Line Surveyor. This job has let me live out my dreams, and it's already brought me lots of fulfillment.",
            "More About Mika: III\tEveryone in the Knights of Favonius is really strong, and I feel like there's something I could learn from each member. After gaining new skills from everyone, I should also do my best to return the favor. So if there's anything the others need help with, then I'll do my best to make that happen.",
            "More About Mika: IV\tIt seems like... after I assisted the Grand Master and Captain Eula a few times with their errands, some members of our group have begun to see me as their official messenger. If I ever misspoke, it would cause trouble for our leaders, and the blame would be all mine. So, whenever I am around others I'm unfamiliar with, I often try to only comment on things I'm absolutely confident in, which makes everyone think I'm timid. But would you say this whole situation is just a sort of misunderstanding?",
            "More About Mika: V\tYou know, one good thing after coming back from the expedition is that I don't feel so worried anymore. As long as I'm not causing trouble for anyone else, then I don't really mind what anyone might think of me. The Knights of Favonius is like my second family, and I've got to master my work as a Front-Line Surveyor. My hard work can let everyone finish their tasks more smoothly and end their days with just that much less to worry about...",
            "Mika's Hobbies\tOh? My hobbies? ...I guess my favorite thing would be camping out in unknown territory. Just taking in the fresh scenery, making a cozy little camp, starting a bonfire and making some food. It really brings me happiness!",
            "Mika's Troubles\tTo be honest, I'm not too good at dealing with people I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's because I'm not really good at holding a conversation. Can you give me some pointers in that area?",
            "Favorite Food\tThe Grand Master said that a youngster like me needs to eat more meat, which will build more strength and physical stamina. Even though there's little chance I'll ever get really buff. I do like eating meat dishes. The others in the Reconnaissance Company seem to share this taste as well.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tUnlike my brother, I can't stand the taste of alcohol. All it takes is one sip and I'd be out cold, and the others would have to go out of their way to take care of me. Even just the smell of a strong drink being opened is enough to make me dizzy.",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tThanks so much... this is such a marvelous dish, I would feel terrible using it just to fill my stomach! Can I put it away for storage?",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tThe taste and portions are both incredible. You really went the extra mile for me.",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tUgh... well, since you went to the trouble of making this for me. I promise I'll finish it.",
            "Birthday\tOh, what should we do for an occasion like this? Hmm... Today is your most special day, so we should really live it up! I've prepared \"A Tour of Mondstadt's Most Stunning Spots.\" It contains information on lots of beautiful locations that are hardly known to anyone else. I wish you happiness every day until this day arrives again next year.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Intro\tEven though I'm still miles behind you, I'm feeling a little more confident now. At least, I won't end up dragging you down again.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tI hope I'll be able to provide more useful intelligence, and help take some weight off of your shoulders!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tPlease allow me to always travel alongside you, and survey the land around us!",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tThank you so much! With this, I am now so much closer to my goal — allowing everyone to advance safely and navigate through rough terrain without any fear of fatigue or potential danger!",

            "Character Details\tWhenever he shows up at the Knights of Favonius headquarters, Mika always swiftly finishes any discussions to be had with his fellow knights, then quietly slips away to avoid becoming a hindrance to others' work.\nMika always gets nervous when someone strikes up a conversation with him, frantically scampering away right after politely putting an end to the idle chatter.\nThe knights know that the young man's name is Mika, and that he is Huffman's younger brother and the second son of the Schmidt family. They also know that he is a member of the Reconnaissance Company, but nothing much beyond that.\nFew are aware of what Mika's job entails, nor do they know that the widely-promoted, updated version of their military map is the fruit of his labors.\nThe new map consists of detailed statistical data regarding almost every corner of Mondstadt with practical markers indicating road conditions, areas with heightened monster activity, high ground that can serve as temporary strongholds, and the distribution of natural resources... The amount of detail could almost make your head spin.\nAll of this is the result of Mika's own labor throughout the two years he has spent traveling all across Mondstadt and investigating every inch of terrain he set foot on.\nKnights who have fought alongside Mika know that he finds using both lance and crossbow at the same time the most convenient, and his unique fighting style has left a lasting impression.\nHowever, they have also been solemnly \"warned\" by Mika to never speak of him to others unless absolutely necessary.\n\"Mika's terrified of drawing the attention of others — he'll get nervous if you so much as stare at him, to say nothing of showering him with compliments. He's been a great asset to the Knights and helped us out a lot, so respecting his boundaries is the least we can do as seniors!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tMika comes from a loving family. His mother works as an author writing about local conditions, his father is a retired Knight of Favonius, and his older brother Huffman is a current member in the Knights' ranks.\nWhen Mika began learning to read, his mother went inspiration-gathering abroad with his father accompanying her. During that time, the responsibility of looking after little Mika landed in Huffman's hands.\nHowever, Huffman had already made the Knights of Favonius his second home — he was preoccupied with work during the day and indulged in drinking with his friends night after night. With his own life lacking organization, how was he expected to take care of his little brother?\nSo it was little Mika who learned to take care of both himself and his brother whenever he'd return home drunk at night. When other children his age were enjoying their childhood without a care, Mika had already learned to stick to an organized schedule, sometimes even helping Huffman with his everyday chores.\nWhile they were away, Mika's parents always made sure to send a letter back to Mondstadt every week to keep their children from worrying. Mika's mother, being an excellent writer, could somehow describe the scenery she's seen in a mesmerizing way akin to fairytales. Mika loved to read his parents' letters before looking for their exact location and marking out their travel route on a map. Picturing his parents' wonderful adventures was Mika's favorite pastime.\nBefore long, Mika developed a passion for reading maps, and even committed the terrain of many locations to memory.\nUnfortunately, Huffman had to ruin the mood when he broke the bad news to Mika: \"I'm afraid your efforts have been wasted on the map Mom and Dad left us. It's very outdated, and it wasn't very accurately drawn in the first place.\" But that was to be expected. After all, those who with the ability freely explore the wilderness would likely have all become adventurers with nothing but commissions and Mora on their minds. To them, just about any map would do.\nOn the other hand, most of those who knew how to draw decent maps were not skilled in combat, so it would be much too dangerous for them to survey the wilderness themselves. Not to mention their limited income, which wouldn't allow them to afford bodyguards. Perhaps the time would come when the Knights of Favonius finally had sufficient budget to hire experts to deal with matters like these, but with Mondstadt as peaceful as one could hope for, no one knew for sure when something as trivial as cartography could be put on the schedule. So little Mika thought to himself: If he could reach every corner of the world just like his parents, and record every detail of the terrain beneath his feet... That would be the most fun ever.\nFrom then on, Mika set a clear goal for himself.\n\"I'll become Mondstadt's expert cartographer.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tWhen Mika's parents returned to Mondstadt, they were delighted to hear of Mika's new-found goal and promised to do whatever they could to support him.\nFrom that day on, Mika dedicated most of his time to poring over geography books and assiduously honing his drawing skills in the library.\nLisa took a liking to this polite, gifted yet hardworking child and often recommended books to him, guiding him towards the most efficient path.\nAfter some time, Mika gained Lisa's recognition — \"With your current skills and abilities, you just might qualify for studying at the Akademiya.\"\nIt was then that Mika began looking for opportunities to put his knowledge to the test. As it happens, Ella Musk, whom he had gotten acquainted with while studying at the library, happened to be looking for a guide for a language exchange trip to the secluded wilderness.\nAnd that became Mika's first real expedition. Though they did safely arrive at their destination, due to an error in Ella Musk's word choice, the pair ended up getting beaten by the hilichurls.\nMika concluded that this setback was due to his lack of combat prowess. \"I need to learn how to protect myself,\" he thought, \"or I won't be able to guarantee the success of my expeditions to unfamiliar areas.\"\nThereafter, Mika rode the momentum from his time spent learning in the library and began to learn fighting techniques from his brother. Luckily, Mika had a strong constitution and quickly grasped the basics.\nIt happened that the Knights of Favonius had just drafted their plan for an expedition set to depart three years later. They were still looking to recruit a few more members to fill some positions, and \"Front-Line Surveyor\" was among the open spots.\nThis role had strict prerequisites: those applying for the position should have some level of expertise in cartography, and due to potentially dangerous conditions, they would be leading the team from the front lines, making combat skills a must.\nThis was Mika's chance, but it all felt too much like a dream...\nMika initially believed that he would be invited into the team as an external consultant, but the position of Front-Line Surveyor would no doubt make him a full-fledged member of the expedition — and one crucial to the entire team. He was daunted by the thought at first, afraid that he wasn't worthy of such an important role that according to him, \"only the strongest would qualify for.\"\nHis doubts were soon dispelled by his father and brother's encouragement, and he remembers their words to this day:\n\"You don't have to ask too much of yourself. Doing your best to help will be more than enough.\"\n\"Most of the knights are just ordinary people like us, but once we put our strengths together as a team, even the strongest of adventurers would struggle to prove our equal.\"\nThus, Mika seized the opportunity and signed up for the position.\nHe felt reassured that he would, at least, be dedicating his time to what he loved.",
            "Character Story 3\tWord of Mika signing up for the expedition spread like wildfire throughout the Knights of Favonius.\n\"Huffman's little brother will be joining us! The little kid who always takes care of that drunkard will be joining the Knights!\"\nThe anxiety from unexpectedly becoming the center of attention made his breaths quicken as his heart pounded — Mika was afraid of failing the Knights' assessment and disgracing his father, ruining his brother's career, or worse, ruining the reputation of his family name.\nConsidering that many members of the Schmidt family had already joined their ranks, the Knights of Favonius decided to raise the bar for entry and make the whole assessment process public in order to make the selection as fair as possible.\nTaking real-life scenarios into consideration, lead examiner Kaeya came up with a series of challenges that strictly assessed the participants' abilities:\nHiking up Dragonspine while wearing full armor and carrying a heavy load;\nMapping out a monster-infested region without the aid of any reference material...\nLuckily, Mika came well-prepared and gave it his all, eventually passing the most difficult challenge and becoming one of three successful candidates.\nThe other two candidates had both received Mika's aid along the way as well — to him, they were more like future teammates than competitors, in any case.\nMika's excellent exhibition of teamwork gained the recognition of Grand Master Varka, who allocated the two other new recruits to the Cavalry Company and Investigation Team, while personally taking Mika in to go with him on his expedition.\nEvery week, Varka would teach Mika combat techniques and give him assorted \"homework\" to complete.\nMika would later join the Reconnaissance Company. Communicating with its rather unusual Captain further strengthened his communication skills, which would help him greatly when working with the elite knights of the expedition team.\nAfter joining the Knights, Mika honed his cartography skills while investigating dangerous locations as a Front-Line Surveyor while receiving pointers on how he might improve his other skills from Varka.\nThe diligent young recruit quickly became a calm and reliable knight — though it seems as though he has yet to realize that himself.",
            "Character Story 4\tAs Mika continuously refined his skills in real-life combat, he became a core member of the Reconnaissance Company in less than two years, completing countless missions alongside his teammates.\nThe scheduled date drew near, and the expedition team was soon about to depart.\nAt the send-off party, Grand Master Varka was pleasantly surprised by the shiny new Vision on Mika's right wrist. But after personally inviting Mika to spar, he concluded that Mika's current abilities were \"remarkable, but far from enough.\"\nMika didn't figure out what that meant until the expedition team entered a dangerous restricted area, where he finally saw with his own eyes the monsters Grand Master Varka had used as a reference when judging his powers.\nThose unnamable, wandering creatures could become a nightmare for any knight unfortunate enough to stray away from the team.\nThe speed of their scouts in the vanguard determined how fast the whole expedition team proceeded, so during the days when the team was the busiest, Mika could only rest for half an hour a day.\nIt was Mika's first time working under such high pressure, and he did so with great difficulty. Not to mention that apart from dangers of the unknown, the expedition team was under the watchful gaze of another party...\nOne day, when Mika was getting ready to call it a night, he received a warning from another scout that the Knights had encountered enemies.\nWhen Mika hurried on scene, Varka had already drawn up battle lines with his trusty subordinates.\nIn the depths of the pitch-dark night, Mika could vaguely make out a line of soldiers, silently standing there as if they were lifeless war machines.\nAnd right in the middle of the enemy formation was a dark, distinct silhouette. Even though torches lit the area, Mika could see nothing but their eerily dark blue eyes that seemed to glow with an uncanny aura.\nAt his teammate's reminder, Mika learned of their identity — the Fatui Harbinger known as \"The Captain\" and his direct, elite subordinates.\nAs it turned out, their vanguard had bumped into Fatui scouts and an altercation had ensued, resulting in both sides getting jumpy and continuously requesting reinforcements, eventually alerting their respective commanders.\nThe scent of gunpowder was thick in the air, the sense of crisis turned Mika's limbs numb and cold.\nHe couldn't help visualizing the confrontation escalating into an armed conflict, and what he should do if such a thing were to happen...\nThe Harbinger, in particular — Mika knew that he would be utterly helpless to parry a single half-hearted swipe from this person.\nHis jumbled thoughts and exhaustion made it difficult to breathe or focus.\nVarka, however, seemed completely unfazed. He greeted the Harbinger from afar and walked towards him with his weapon in hand. The Captain, too, signaled his men to stand by as he began slowly stepping forward.\nAs the tension between the two parties reached its peak, Varka and The Captain briefly conversed and seemed to reach an agreement.\nThe dark silhouette raised his arm, and the ghostly shadows of the Fatui soldiers silently turned and departed with him.\nThe Knights all heaved a sigh of relief, and some were even trembling with fear. But when Varka returned to the Knights' formation, he looked as relaxed as ever.\n\"Well, that was a surprise! If it weren't for our unique circumstances, I would've loved to invite him for a duel!\"\n\"And it's not like he's a stubborn fellow. He's well aware that engaging in battle in a strange and foreign land would've been disadvantageous for both of us.\"\nIt was until then that Mika realized they had been on the precipice of war, and yet the Grand Master had been there to put a stop to the conflict.\nThe Captain's overpowering presence and the calmness with which Grand Master Varka handled the crisis both left a profound impression in Mika's mind.\nMika reflected on this experience for a long time and concluded that although he had been improving in strength, he still had a long way to go when it came to dealing with situations like that.\nThere was more to be done than just doing his best to help the team. He had to work harder to become a reliable Knight who could handle all manner of incidents...",
            "Character Story 5\tFortunately, Mika would not run into anything exceedingly dangerous during the expedition and smoothly made it past that most difficult period.\nDuring Mondstadt's Weinlesefest, Mika returned to Mondstadt with Grand Master Varka's letter and resumed his post in the Reconnaissance Company.\nThe members of the Reconnaissance Company were both excited at his return and surprised at the astonishing progress he had made — for he could now easily complete tasks that usually required three forward scouts.\nAnd considering that the Grand Master's letter had vaguely mentioned the Fatui, and that Mika had been a key member on the expedition under Varka's direct command... His teammates quickly connected the dots and a strange chain of logic emerged:\n\"Mika fought against the Fatui! Mika might've fought against Fatui elites! Mika must've fought alongside the Grand Master and won a battle against a Fatui Harbinger!\"\n\"How else could he have become this strong all of a sudden? Mika's our hero! He can now do anything for us!\"\nTruth be told, Mika had simply accrued a great deal of experience — the other Knights who had gone had also made progress to varying extents. They simply had yet to return, and thus no valid comparison could be made.\nMika didn't know how to deal with all the absurd rumors, and so he consulted Jean and Kaeya for advice.\nJean informed the leader of each company to remain rational and refrain from spreading rumors based purely on speculation. Besides, many matters regarding the expedition were considered highly confidential and should be treated with discretion.\nKaeya, on the other hand, seemed to enjoy joking about the rumors. Members of the Knights of Favonius all more or less held some sort of dislike for the Fatui, and a rumor that says \"Mika gave the Fatui a good beating\" could very well boost morale.\nWhatever the case, Mika felt greatly reassured now that the Acting Grand Master had been made aware of the situation and was comforted to know that he hadn't caused any trouble for anyone.\nHe reported to duty as usual and made sure he did all he could to help others.\nBut the exaggerated rumors couldn't be un-spread, and Mika has found that gaining too much trust comes with its own fair share of difficulties...\nRecently, more Knights have been coming up to him to borrow a new map, ask for help maintaining a weapon, or request a share of the Reconnaissance Company's field rations.\nAll of them seem to hope that some of his powers might rub off on them so that they can become stronger quickly, just like him.",
            "Multipurpose Front-Line Surveying Device\tAn intricate book-shaped device Mika carries with him wherever he goes.\nIt was developed by Mika and technicians from the Investigation Team, and its key components were made using Albedo's latest alchemical creations.\nA notebook is embedded in the device's interior that can be used to record information. Designed to facilitate the quick production and use of maps, each of its pages can be conveniently removed and replaced.\nAn elaborate pattern is carved on to the back panel of the device. Channeling elemental power into the carving will activate the prism-shaped component outside said panel, which will in turn fire a \"wavebeam\" towards a fan-shaped target region.\nThe distance between the device and the target region can then be accurately calculated using the time taken for the beam to bounce back. By increasing both the frequency and amplitude of the beam, the device will generate a sketch of a small area of terrain.\nThis function can greatly improve the accuracy of a map, but regrettably, everything else — including the statistical information and calculations regarding the terrain in question — has to be computed in the user's mind.\nOnly those with excellent spatial reasoning skills and an extensive knowledge of the target terrain are capable of making full use of this function.\nThus, Mika became the only Front-Line Surveyor who could use the device without difficulty, and its overall usage rate is not very high.\nThere had been other improved devices originally planned for distribution to other teams, but they have been put into storage, to be used as spare parts for Mika's device.\nThe device is Mika's trustiest helper in his work and a symbol of honor for being the best surveyor, but Mika has never once mentioned its impressive features to others.\nTo Mika, that feels too much like bragging, not to mention that it could potentially give Albedo extra work... Troubling others is the last thing Mika ever wants, after all.",
            "Vision\tMika was once in a life-or-death situation.\nThis was not long after he joined the Reconnaissance Company — the information on a certain area was no longer valid, and Mika had taken up the task to update the details of its terrain on his own.\nHe slowly crept into the ruins, only to accidentally knock off a piece of stone from the broken wall, alerting two Abyss Mages lurking in the dark.\nAs the flames intertwined, a rush of elemental power instantly engulfed him as if it was about to crush him into pieces and turn him into the monsters' next meal.\nPain and panic flooded his senses, and only one thought remained in his consciousness — he needed to escape and warn others.\n\"These monsters... They'd be a threat to even the most experienced members in the company...!\"\nIt was the responsibility of a front-line land surveyor to keep their teammates from dangerous situations like this.\nThe Abyss Mages shrieked in glee and were about to command other monsters to come out of hiding when a spinning spear tore the curtain of flames apart. An icy mist burst across the ruins, clearing the unbearable heat in an instant.\nWhen the Abyss Mages finally made sense of the situation, Mika had already fled far away, though still apologizing loudly enough for the monsters to hear:\n\"I'm sorry! I'll remember to knock before entering next time. That way, my seniors can fight you fair and square!\"\n\"Next time\" soon came — the Reconnaissance Company's main force were notified of the monsters and swiftly but cautiously eliminated the threat.\nThey were surprised to find that both of the Abyss Mages' shields had already become quite badly battered, and gazing upon the radiant glow from the Vision on Mika's right wrist, they seemed to realize something...\nThat day, the Reconnaissance Company's dinner was especially sumptuous. Everyone raised their glass to celebrate, while Mika himself seemed to be in shock, unable to wrap his head around what was happening."

Merchants move products, knights patrol, and farmers till the land.\nBut if one were to ask Mona — the enigmatic and prideful astrologist — what she busies herself with, she will reply by saying that she is servicing a debt known as \"life.\"\nShe will, however, vigorously deny being \"poor,\" giving the following explanation:\n\"Beautiful veneers may obscure simple truths.\nExquisite food may mask its nutritional value.\nOne lives simply, all the better to expose this world's truths.\"\nA frugal lifestyle, therefore, is a form of training to access the truth... Or so Mona will insist.\nTeyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business, and even an enigmatic astrologist must look to hers.\n—That said, it seems like bards might be the exception to this rule.",
            "Character Story 1\tRecently, Mona's teacher, an old but highly skilled female astrologist, has entrusted a very important task to her.\nHer teacher has an erstwhile rival-friend in Mondstadt, and she wanted Mona to retrieve a highly confidential box from that person's successor.\n\"If you dare look inside that box... Well, you'll see.\"\nThat was the warning Mona received before departing.\nTo Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.\nThe box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box.\n\"I—I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this...\"\nMona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence.",
            "Character Story 2\tMona's astrology utilizes hydromancy, and she once explained the underlying principles thusly:\n\"It is people's fate that shines in the night sky, and though its reflection in water is but an illusion, it reveals the truth nonetheless.\"\nNo one else can quite comprehend this principle, but Mona's ability convinces people to believe in it anyway.\nAlbeit, sometimes grudgingly...\nHer astrological readings are exceptionally precise, and she will neither lie nor hold anything back when revealing the results of her readings.\n\"Your son says that he's made it. That's a lie.\"\n\"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you.\"\nThe cold, hard truth is laid bare before people' eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.\nMona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.\nBut sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.\nThere, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky — so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them — with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself.",
            "Character Story 3\tHaving never studied the art of finance, the astrologist Mona is always hovering around the poverty line.\nIn order to save on food expenses, she once ate mushrooms for an entire month straight. If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.\nMona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.\nSo where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.\nIn fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.\nThat Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.\nIn order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellations in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.\nNow having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?\nWhenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.\nThis process plays out every month.\nToday, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora.",
            "Character Story 4\tMona will sometimes meet up with Klee and Albedo, her primary reason being to get a free meal.\nSecondary to that is to exchange pointers with Albedo.\nSince they are both people who seek to unveil the principles of the world, and both are accomplished students of famed masters, aligning themselves with one another and working together is perfectly normal.\nMona staunchly defends her teacher's image in front of Albedo.\nHowever, she also often complains about \"that old hag.\"\n\"You speak of your illustrious lineage, yet you also refer to your master as a 'hag' and a 'stubborn dimwit.' Which of these descriptions is accurate?\"\nAlbedo could not help but ask this question — and when he did, Mona promptly realized that she had never given it much thought herself.\nStroking her chin, she pondered this paradox deeply for a moment, before responding:\n\"Hmph. The techniques passed down to me are exceptional, of course, but my teacher is not my equal.\nDoes she know the market rates for eggs, butter, or wheat? In this regard, I have already far surpassed her.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tDuring her apprenticeship, Mona found that the subtle abstractions of her master's teachings could explain the laws that governed the existence of all things.\nHuman hearts were guided by these laws, and if one had great enough powers of calculation, all the mysteries of the world could be understood.\nMona once believed this to be true.\nBut when she had to strike out on her own and live day-to-day, she found herself doubting.\nNot everyone lived wealthy and comfortable lives. Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.\nAnd it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her.\n\"Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs.\"\nThis was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey — the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...\nMona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.\nWhen she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.\nPerhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life.",
            "All Things Astrological\tThe Court of Fontaine's mainline newspaper, The Steambird, has many a featured section that contains all sorts of news and gossip drawn from every corner of the seven nations.\nThe section Mona contributes to is known as \"All Things Astrological,\" and it is a column specifically targeted at hobbyists and professionals. That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.\nWhen the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.\nTheir correspondence left him deeply impressed.\nAs it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.\nWhen Mona released her first column, \"An Introduction to Astrology,\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.\nMost of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.\nThe editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:\n\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus.\"\nAfter getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.\nNow, how best to celebrate... Ah yes. Perhaps she should use her first paycheck to purchase that latest-edition celestial globe she'd had her eye on for a while now...",
            "Vision\tTo Mona, that her Vision was sent to her from the gods doesn't mean a great deal.\nThis is not to say that possessing an external focus for elemental power is not useful.\nHaving power is always a good thing, but when compared to lofty \"truth,\" \"martial prowess\" is such a pathetically small concept.\nThe gods, too, are bound by the rules of this world. Mona seeks the final truth of the world, hidden amidst the sea of stars.\nAs such, she does not have any reverence for her Vision, which the people of this world consider to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power.\nNonetheless, this item that serves no practical use in her hands is something that she treasures greatly.\nIt was gifted to her by her teacher as a teaching aid, and it is the only evidence of their time together as master and pupil.\nShe preserves these distant memories with great care. This exquisitely-made teaching aid thus accompanied her everywhere, like an accessory worn by any other maiden.\nUntil one day, when a Vision of her very own would quietly indwell this old teaching aid..."

            "Character Details\tGreater Lord Rukkhadevata created Sumeru's rainforest and bestowed wisdom upon the people of Sumeru through the Akademiya. Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.\nOn the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol — one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.\nBut the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.\nFrom the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.\nThe Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.\nThrough the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that \"The God of Wisdom will never come back.\"\nShe knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.\nThus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, Nahida makes no argument against it.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe process of learning and growth is joyful, and knowledge concerning this world always satisfies Nahida's exuberant curiosity.\nGradually, Nahida came to grasp the principles of nature and the elements, understanding the ecology of the sky and the sea. She could even compose what she learned into fascinating dreams that are logical, yet beyond imagination.\nSuch dreams are, in essence, the same as Nahida's marvelous metaphors — they all lead to a dawning understanding of the similarities between two otherwise unrelated things.\nBut there are times when she meditates on things yet struggles to figure them out, and such incidents usually concern events related to people or society.\nFor example, when honesty and truth could exempt a person from punishment, some people might turn silent and deceitful; and when with their beloved ones, some people would hurt others with brutal words.\nIt feels as if the contradictions of the entire world are focused through and manifested by human beings, whose fickle emotions are perplexing to Nahida.\nIn such moments, her metaphors would not work. Nor could she find any system in this world as a reference for such chaos.\nShe could only explain it by the fact that the difference between every person's uniqueness creates diverse reactions when they undergo similar emotions.\nBut this was not a satisfactory answer to Nahida. To better know human beings, plain knowledge and dogma alone would never suffice.\nPerhaps it was from that moment on that Nahida came to understand why \"she\" had to stand firmly by human beings' side and even made tremendous sacrifices for their sake.\nFor each and every one of \"them\" is a unique existence in this world.",
            "Character Story 2\tNahida's life might be uniform, but she owns the most fantastic and lively dream in all of Sumeru.\nThe knowledge she learns through the Akasha during the day is presented vividly in her dreams at night. As she learns more knowledge, her dreams become even more intricate and full of life.\nThe dreams not only relax her mind, but also give her chances to examine her new knowledge to see if it goes against common sense or if she is missing any details.\nWhen Dusk Birds first appeared in Nahida's dream, those birds soared through the sky in a standing posture with their wings folded.\nIt looked abnormal and caught Nahida's attention immediately. Nahida thus learned how wings worked, after which the Dusk Birds could fly freely in her dreams.\nNext, she adopted similar methods to fix Shroomboars that slept underwater, Radishes that grew on apple trees, and crystalflies with mismatched wing colors.\nKnowledge shall not be a mere approach to justify things in this world, it could also be used to satisfy her need for pure innocent fun.\nTechnically, Shroomboars can only walk on the ground. Now that she understood how wings work, wouldn't Shroomboars with wings fly all the same?\nAnd where there are flying Shroomboars, it is only natural to have crocodiles that walk on their hind legs and Harra Fruits who speak human languages...\nThe way Nahida develops her knowledge system has subsequently created a little amusement park for her, free of disturbance. In her dreams, she is in the embrace of boundless happiness.",
            "Character Story 3\tChildren have yet to be well-informed and are easily swayed by emotions, but it does not mean that they can be disrespected or mocked.\nFrustration and disappointments do indeed grant them a taste of reality — but at the cost of robbing them of innocent thoughts and exuberant emotions.\nThe children who unluckily run across such negativity would always hear a gentle, warm voice on some ordinary night.\nShe listens attentively to the children, uses her wonderful metaphors to clarify principles to them, plays with them, and talks about their favorite games and snacks... until dawn.\nThough the night is short, such company would let the children believe that there is still someone in this world who understands them.\nHatred and frustration are thus melted away by the warmth in their hearts, and the children would gain an opportunity to make a change in their lives such that they can grow in confidence and gladness.\nHowever, none of them could recognize to whom the gentle, warm voice belonged. Everyone knows, after all, that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had departed a long time ago.\nA group of children gathered in secret and discussed this mystical phenomenon. Suddenly, a child who seemed to know a lot more than their peers mentioned a somewhat unusual name, \"Lesser Lord Kusanali.\"\nThey soon accepted that theory. And, of course, none of their parents believed them.\nBut what did that matter? Lesser Lord Kusanali was already their friend.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe greenery-planning personnel in Sumeru City once received a mysterious letter. The sender was, apparently, \"An Enthusiastic and Perfectly Leisurely Citizen of Sumeru City.\"\nThe letter contained detailed suggestions and thoughtful planning that took both the weather and practicality into consideration.\nJudging by the professionalism of the letter's contents, it was natural to assume that the letter was from a well-known Amurta researcher who would prefer to stay anonymous.\nDespite the writer's anonymity, the greenery-planning personnel carried out their work in the city exactly as stated in the letter, as if they were implementing orders from their superior.\nThe outcome reaped high praise. Later one day, Nahida borrowed Katheryne's body and took a walk on the streets in the city. To her great joy, she found out that the arrangement of plants was exactly the same as she had expected.\nThe letter was from Nahida, of course. She had written it because she thought that though knowledge is important, practice is also essential.\nBut with the exceedingly strict control the sages exercised, Nahida had to persuade them with great effort before they agreed to let her send this seemingly useless letter anonymously.\nBut so encouraged was Nahida by the great success of her first attempt at putting knowledge into practice that in the following days, even when she walked, she was ever so full of elated confidence.\nBut then she rounded a corner and noticed unexpectedly that several flowers of completely mismatched colors had been planted together.\nAfter careful examination, she found out that it was because she had not considered the possibility that one of the flower species might change colors, nor had she specified the cultivation environment for the flowers very strictly in her plans.\nThen it occurred to her that this bunch of flowers could have been here for dozens of days, during which everyone might have witnessed her \"complete lack of aesthetic sense\"...\nThat day, many claimed that they saw Ms. Katheryne, who usually stood behind the reception desk with a confident smile, crouching next to a pot of flowers, her hands covering her blushing face.",
            "Character Story 5\tHow might one eradicate the threat that forbidden knowledge poses to Irminsul?\nNahida used to believe that she was the one who had the answer, but never did she realize that she was also the answer herself.\nOne who takes action will certainly leave one's traces behind. When one wishes to eradicate oneself, a paradox would thus occur.\nThat is why it is inevitable that one must depend on others to accomplish this goal.\nBy the time Nahida had figured this out, time was running out, leaving her no room for further consideration. The knowledge accumulated through the years could not even help her find a solution to the pressing dilemma before her.\nBut just as ████ said, as one with wisdom, one should feel joy upon the discovery of the answer.\nShe was not born just to accomplish such cruel deeds. Only after eradicating forbidden knowledge could she focus on Sumeru's future and plan for the prosperity and happiness that her nation could call its own.\nWill a nation walking into the future still remember a name that no longer exists? It does not matter.\n\"Does it really not matter?\"\nNahida would have definitely proposed otherwise. Shame, then, that their time was too short. In that blink of an eye, ████ did not even leave her a chance to retort.",
            "Nahida's \"Toy Box\"\tThough it looks no different from a regular box, this container has a variety of experimental replicas within it.\nNahida has a strong interest in popular games of all sorts. Their rules are simple, but they are also fun and profound. Be it puzzles or battle games, the fascination they inspire can be long-lasting.\nGames are simple but not simplistic, exemplifying the wisdom of their designers. Deconstructing and reshaping things also make for valuable opportunities to learn.\nHowever, the Akademiya researchers never supported her novel ideas, nor would they satisfy her wish for more toys. So, she compromised and asked for only wood and some tools.\nFollowing the instructions offered by the Akasha and applying her imagination, she managed to create various toys, such as chessboards, cards, puzzle pieces, and three-dimensional locks...\nThe sense of achievement from finishing making toys brought Nahida brief satisfaction, but she soon found this out:\nShe could not find an opponent for any battle-type games, and as the maker, she knew the solutions to all her puzzle games.\n\"If only there were someone else around to try these out.\"\nSo she has always hoped. But before that suitable person shows up, these toys shall stay in their box for now.",
            "Gnosis\tThe existence of the Akasha is the means, not an end in itself. The moment when the forbidden knowledge was eradicated was the moment when the Akasha had accomplished its mission.\nThe one who had coveted the power of the Gnosis had written the entire drama from the start, and would show themselves as the curtains fell.\nNahida, using the Gnosis of a foreign land as leverage, deprived the cunning foe of his \"segments\" as insurance.\nBut the enemy immediately requested for a bargain as well, offering up critical knowledge of the world's \"truth.\"\nHis knowledge of the values rooted in this land was without peer, and thus had he intended to take advantage of Nahida's curiosity and sense of responsibility from the very beginning. Indeed, the way he saw it, there could be no bargaining chip more suitable than knowledge.\nWith one Gnosis still in her hands, Nahida could not help but hesitate. She barely knew more about the Gnoses than she knew the \"truth\" of the world.\nThe Gnosis, to her, was but a core that gathers a mass of elemental power at her discretion. But if there is nothing more to a Gnosis, why was a god so eager to gather all of them together?\nShaking hands in bargain means an equal compromise for both sides, a far cry from any victory. On the other hand, turning down the bargain indicates a certain type of \"ignorance,\" which, obviously, would more easily invite a loss of control.\nThus did the \"God of Wisdom\" instantly find her answer..."

            "About Dori\tThe big-spending merchant Dori has watched me dance before. I remember that she talked with Mr. Zubayr once, and then never came back. Did something happen? ...Huh? She wanted me to go on tour around Teyvat? No way, Mr. Zubayr definitely would've refused for me! ...Ahh, please tell me he has...",
            "About Lesser Lord Kusanali\tThe people of the Great Bazaar love Lesser Lord Kusanali. I'd love to hear her thoughts on my Dance of Sabzeruz... Oh, no, no, forget it... If she were in the audience, I'd get stage fright...",
            "More About Nilou: I\tAaagh! Sorry, I'm trying to decide what to eat, and I got lost in thought. Hee-hee, do you need help with anything?",
            "More About Nilou: II\tMy teacher taught me everything there is to know about dance, but she said that the most important thing is putting feeling into your movements. Only then can you move your audience and convey emotion. To express beauty, I must first become the embodiment of beauty.",
            "More About Nilou: III\tSometimes, I receive letters from showgoers who say that my dancing has cheered them up. I always share this kind of happy news with everyone at Zubayr Theater. Even though I'm the one the audience sees on the stage, it's because of everyone's collective efforts that I can stand up there in the first place.",
            "More About Nilou: IV\tThe Grand Bazaar occasionally hosts other kinds of performances, such as juggling showcases. I've tried juggling before, but I always end up catching the balls with my head... Mr. Zubayr and everyone else just laughed at me. They probably thought I had really good hand-eye coordination. Hee-hee, I've been exposed.",
            "More About Nilou: V\tSomeone once told me that I was like a shining oasis that restored life and happiness to others with its warmth. That was nice of them to say, and I was happy to hear it, but... what I want to show people is much more than that. After spending so much time with you, though, I finally understand how it feels to have someone care for and look after you. Now... Now, I feel like that comparison is a far better one for you.",
            "Nilou's Hobbies\t\"My life is dance,\" or \"Dance is my life\"... Which phrase is the better way to describe it? Agh, I'm no good at logical things like this. Anyway, I'll just keep on dancing. I want to use my performances to show the beauty of art to more people.",
            "Nilou's Troubles\tI still can't tell poisonous mushrooms apart from non-poisonous ones... Apparently, color doesn't mean much — poisonous mushrooms can be bright or dull. Mmm, I feel like I understand, but I also don't...",
            "Favorite Food\tSweets always make you feel better! Most people in Sumeru love them. Wanna try some? I'll get some for you!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI have a hard time eating mushrooms, mostly because I'm scared... Not the type of scared that makes you want to run away, though! When I was little, I once ate a poisonous mushroom and was bedridden for days... If you want to eat any of Sumeru's mushroom dishes, please make sure to check that the ingredients are all edible!",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tThis must be what it feels like to have flavors dancing on your tongue... How wonderful!",

            "Birthday\tUmm... Happy birthday! I learned a new dance, and I want to show it to you. Uh, am I nervous? *sigh* You saw right through me. It's because... I wanted to incorporate my feelings into the moves, but then the choreography just got more and more difficult... Anyway, I just wish that your life will always be full of wonder and happiness.",

            "Character Details\t\"Since you're in Sumeru, you must not miss Nilou's performances.\"\nThis is a fact that most people in Sumeru agree on.\nThere is no threshold for Nilou's dances, so everyone can come and enjoy a most fascinating and engrossing time there.\nNilou's audience comes from all walks of life. Be it a knowledgeable researcher or a mercenary who's seen true brutality — everyone is attracted here by Nilou's gorgeous, dancing form.\nEvery time Nilou takes the stage, a press of people crowds the Grand Bazaar until all are standing shoulder to shoulder.\nRational sense and wisdom are the mainstream in Sumeru, while art, which stands for sensibility, does not enjoy the same popularity and respect.\nYet if wisdom is meaning bestowed upon Sumeru by the goddess, then art stands for meaning that human beings seek for themselves.",
            "Character Story 1\tUnlike other dancers across the continent who hail from artistic families, Nilou came from an ordinary family in Sumeru.\nThe life that the family of three once lived was no different from that of many who lived in downtown area.\nThe knowledge they gained from the Akasha was enough for their common day-to-day lives.\nIf there was anything special about Nilou's family, it was that Nilou's parents' loved and cared for her very much.\nAlthough the pursuit of scholarship is prevalent in Sumeru, Nilou's parents never compared Nilou with other children, nor did they expect Nilou to become a researcher.\nGrowing up happily and living a stable life was all that they wanted for her.\nNilou thus grew up surrounded by love and respect.\nLater, even when there were differences of opinion and occasional arguments between her parents, Nilou's thoughtful and considerate mediation would permit no harm or grudge to ever linger in their family.",
            "Character Story 2\tEvery inch of the Grand Bazaar has been measured by Nilou's footprints, and she keeps everyone at Grand Bazaar in her heart.\nNilou can introduce anyone in the Grand Bazaar in detail, as if they were a family member.\nMr. Jut usually gets up early to make tahchin, so if you want the privilege of having the most delicious bite of freshly cooked tahchin, be sure to get up early!\nMr. Afshin's storytelling skills are simply divine. His wonderful ingenuity always makes people want to buy his merchandise.\nMr. Hushang, who sells toys, has very dexterous hands. With them, he fashions the most fascinating little toys, and they are very popular amongst children.\nAnd, of course, everyone has long regarded this smart red-haired girl as a family member too.\nEvery time Nilou goes grocery shopping, she always ends up carrying more items than on her purchase list just by making a single trip through the streets, and the weight of the groceries shows exactly how much people like and take care of Nilou.\nOf course, Nilou also takes care of them in return.\nHushang and Farhad may have a quarrel over a bet, about as long as Nilou shows up, the two will surely be reconciled.\nIf Afshin's Sumpter Beasts have stolen someone else's food, Nilou will come forward and help make amends.\nIf you ask Nilou why she is so enthusiastic, she will answer with a smile:\n\"Because family is supposed to help each other, hehe.\"\nFor Nilou, her mom and dad are her small family, while everyone in the Grand Bazaar is her big family.",
            "Character Story 3\tNilou remembers clearly that she met her teacher at the Sabzeruz Festival when she was eight years old.\nBack then, the Knight of Flowers gave her a lot of Yalda Candies, and so little Nilou passed by the Zubayr Theater with candies in both hands.\nThe Sabzeruz Festival is a celebration that features dance, but before, only dance groups from abroad were invited to sing and dance at the festival — and on a temporary stage, to boot.\nNow that the Grand Bazaar finally had its own theater, excited people were flocking to the new stage.\nLittle Nilou managed to squeeze through the crowd to the front of the stage and saw the teacher dance for the first time.\nEven though there were no flowers on the stage, at that moment, Nilou felt as if she was watching thousands upon thousands of flowers blooming all at once.\nThe candies in her hands fell to the ground unnoticed, and she couldn't help but dance along.\nIt was only when the dance had ended that little Nilou realized what she had done, and hurriedly apologized to the people around her who had made room.\nIt was at this moment that her teacher also walked down from the stage in an elegant manner and helped her pick the Yalda Candies back up.\nShe reached out her hand to little Nilou, and asked gracefully—\n\"Would you like to join me for a future dance?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tAlthough she has lived her entire life in Sumeru, the city of wisdom, Nilou has never shown any talent in the field of \"knowledge.\" However, she always knows how to soothe the emotions of others in her own way.\n\"This is probably a generous gift to me from Lesser Lord Kusanali.\"\nAfter learning to dance with her teacher, Nilou became deeply aware of the power of body language.\nCombining her talents and knowledge of body language, she created her very own form of \"body movement therapy.\"\nFor example, when Mr. Zubayr is angry, everyone in the theater would be walking on eggshells.\nBut Nilou would keep a warm smile, drawing wonderful patterns one after another in the air with her arms and fingers.\n\"Imagine that we are in the rainforest that has just rained, and that you are following me as we walk onward, saying hello to every animal that passes by, waving, leaving everything else behind...\"\nPerhaps this may seem childish and funny to a bystander, but for those who are wrapped up in the moment, Nilou's gentle voice can cause the anger that clouds their minds to disappear before they even know it.\nWhat's even more amazing is that, according to Mr. Afshin, this body movement therapy has been trending recently — and it even works on his two stubborn Sumpter Beasts...",
            "Character Story 5\tBe it in day-to-day life or her performances on stage, Nilou has always maintained a simple attitude —\nTo melt everyone's worries away and let comfort and ease waltz in.\nBut when \"trouble\" comes to her, she is often distressed due to her inability to make the call.\nTahchin sure is delicious, but Pita Pocket is also good, and I also saw someone holding a Potato Boat that seemed really yummy. Which one should I eat tonight?\nI've heard people talk about places outside Sumeru City... the pure white snowy mountain and windmills the size of giants... Should I also consider going out for a trip?\nNilou can often find good reasons to go with any of the options she is considering, and so they are like Forest Tree Frogs sitting across from one another with bellies out, not one able to win the others over.\nBut if there was a person who could make a decision at this time and tell her with confidence and calm:\n\"Why not have half the amount of each and share them with me?\"\n\"And as for those places you have never been to, I have already set foot there. I can assure you that they are safe.\"\n...Nilou would dismiss her hesitation in an instant and raise her arms in a dance-like graceful gesture of thanks, before indulging in the joy of having solved a great problem for a long time indeed.",
            "Letters from the Audience\tRefusing to accept gifts on stage has been a long-standing rule in the Zubayr Theater.\nSometimes, the audiences do still get too excited and may insist on giving various kinds of gifts to Nilou. That said, such givers will definitely receive a gift in return the very next day, along with a note that has been left at their doors...\n\"Thank you for your kindness. If you would like to express your love for Nilou's dance, you may write a letter to the Zubayr Theater instead of sending gifts.\"\nAnd so it came to pass that like snow flakes dancing and falling in the air, letters filled with the audience members' passionate praise have been sent in batches and droves by the Dusk Birds to the theater's mailbox.\nDuring her free time when there are no shows or rehearsals, Nilou will read every letter carefully, share this joy with the other members of the Zubayr Theater, and then carefully preserve these letters.\nEvery word and every expression of recognition and fondness in the letters is worth remembering and appreciating.\nAs Nilou bettered her dancing skills, more and more people came to watch her dance, and in time, the letters have added up to quite the stack indeed.\nBut if someone cracks a joke, saying that Nilou is the most valuable treasure in the Zubayr Theater, she will definitely shake her head with a sweet smile.\n\"Our most valuable treasure is our audience's love, and it is all carefully stored in one mysterious box.\"",
            "Vision\tNilou has heard her teacher talk about the meaning of dance more than once. From her teacher's perspective, dance is born from human life and has belonged to everyone from the very beginning.\n\"As a dancer, you should convey emotions on stage, and your audience's smiles are their response to the emotions conveyed in your dance.\"\nNilou was well aware that she was nowhere near as good at thinking about the \"meaning\" behind things as Akademiya researchers. But still, she practiced diligently each day under the direction of her teacher and planned to continue following in her footsteps.\nWhen she finally first took the stage, she quickly became completely immersed in the performance, holding nothing back.\nShe thought of the wind, the moon, the gentle sound of the rose blooming, the feeling of stroking the tail feathers of Dusk Birds, and a myriad of beautiful things that existed in this world.\nShe wanted to display the beauty she perceived in her heart to the entire audience through her dance.\nSlowly, splashes of water ran together, converging into a lake on the stage. Like a Crystalfly dancing on a lake's surface, Nilou gently fluttered back and forth, and the lake-mirror rippled slightly in time to her steps.\nLike a water lily, her body swirled in the middle of that lake. Amazed at such pure and flawless beauty, the audience almost forgot to breathe.\nAfter the curtain fell, Nilou flopped down on the backstage chair and took deep breaths.\nLike dewdrops on a lotus leaf, a Hydro Vision had appeared at her waist.\nNilou thought then that she had perhaps found the purpose of dance at last — \n\"To become beauty, and then to convey the beauty and value of art.\""

            "Character Details\tThe \"Liyue Qixing\" controls all of the commerce that takes place in Liyue Harbor. Its highly-revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a low profile.\nThe \"Tianquan\" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. \nShe is seen as an excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly elder sister to kids, a socialite at the banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town, and everyone seems to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of Ningguang, with great discrepancies between the versions.\nStill, if there's one thing all the rumors about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.",
            "Character Story 1\tUp above Liyue Harbor, there is a floating palace held up by plaustrite. It is known as the \"Jade Chamber,\" and it belongs to Ningguang.\nOn a clear day, one can see almost all of Liyue Harbor from the decks outside the palace gates.\nWhenever Ningguang has important business matters to handle, she invariably comes to this floating palace. She strictly forbids anyone from accessing the premises except for her three trusted confidants. Her confidants sort through the relevant information, summarize it and hang the summaries on the wall, while Ningguang rests against the railings, enjoying the view of Liyue and quietly mulling everything over.\nShe is certain to arrive at the perfect solution before her confidants have finished adding everything to the wall. Once she has made her decision she shreds everything and throws it out of the window, creating something of a snowstorm of paper.\nThe handwriting on the shredded pieces of paper stands out like ink in the snow to all of the merchants in Liyue Harbor.\nFor they know that whenever Ningguang's shredded snow falls, a huge change is about to descend on the business community.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Ningguang knows everything,\" foreigners will often find the Liyue locals warning them.\nLoophole-hunting guilds, market-manipulating hoarders, smugglers coming ashore with their illicit goods... The Tianquan knows all the details, good, bad and ugly.\nOnce, an alchemist from Sumeru was traveling in Liyue and unwittingly happened across the records of a certain noctilucous jade transaction involving the Blackcliff Forge ten years prior. That night, someone from Ningguang's inner circle knocked on his window and invited him to join Ningguang in the Jade Chamber for a talk.\nRumor has it that Ningguang has enchanted the Jade Chamber in such a way that allows her to eavesdrop on everyone in the city's private conversations...\nThe truth is that Ningguang's eyes and ears are in fact the children who play on the streets in Liyue Harbor.\nBetween them, they are aware of every confidential meeting, every private conversation, and every new visitor to the city. When Ningguang gathers them around, her promise of delicious treats proves to be an irresistible incentive, and so they tell her everything they know.\nOnce she has finished carefully cross-referencing everything she has learned from the children against other sources, there is no secret hidden from her in Liyue Harbor.\nShe understands the value of reciprocity more than anyone, which is why she is more than willing to invest time in mingling with the common folk.\nOn top of that, she does actually like seeing the children smile.",
            "Character Story 3\tNingguang's attitude to making money is largely the same as anyone else's: you can never have enough.\nBut money to her is more than just a sign of wealth — each Mora is a trophy of a hard-won victory.\nNingguang is kind and friendly toward the common folk, but this is a side of her that none of her business associates could ever hope to see.\nTo her, the business world is a playground, and the zero-sum games are the most exciting. Each round she wins against a wealthy merchant brings a gleeful smile to her face as they sigh and reluctantly hand over the Mora, and nothing makes her happier than seeing the guilds bow to her wishes.\nEvery victory in this game adds to the wealth of the Liyue Qixing. Liyue Harbor prospers as a result, and this in turn creates more business opportunities and more profit for Ningguang. Every member of the Liyue Qixing is more than happy with this perfect cycle of interlocking interests.\nPeople often ask Ningguang why she is still doing business in Liyue Harbor when she has already acquired such vast wealth.\n\"Vast wealth is a wonderful thing.\"\nNingguang patiently replies, never able to understand why people would ask such foolish questions.\n\"Adding another Mora to the pot can hardly make it any less wonderful, now, can it?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tEveryone living in Liyue Harbor has to abide by the rules. Those who do so will see their interests protected, while those who violate the rules will be punished accordingly.\nThe rules are rooted in ancient laws set down by Morax, Liyue Harbor's divine protector, and they are absolute. Over the millennia, each Tianquan has introduced amendments to the rules to ensure they are well aligned with current societal needs.\nThe laws are compiled and published along with a 279-page commentary, and a copy is given to each citizen of Liyue.\nNingguang likes it this way: Law and order is good for business, and she understands the intricacies of the laws that forge the order better than anyone else.\nHowever, there was a certain ship captain by the name of Beidou who acted with flagrant disregard for the rules, smuggling contraband goods by leveraging her exotic cargo and exclusive business intelligence. To Ningguang, captain Beidou was the black sheep of Liyue Harbor's business community.\nAs Tianquan, it fell to Ningguang to impose heavy fines on Beidou each time she transgressed the rules. But much to her consternation, Beidou seemed to take these fines in her stride, like water off a duck's back.\nOutside of the official channels, too, Ningguang tried to find ways to implore Beidou to change her ways and stop putting the Qixing in such a difficult position. In response, Beidou simply explained away her actions as \"enacting justice,\" \"helping the poor\" and \"keeping the sailors in their jobs.\" As a firm believer in the principle of live and let live, Beidou had no time for Ningguang's advice.\nIn the end, Ningguang agreed to disagree and gave up trying to convince the stubborn Beidou to change.",
            "Character Story 5\tBeing the charming and wealthy woman that she is, Ningguang has never had a shortage of suitors.\nIt seems that every eligible bachelor, from the young esquires of Yujing Terrace, to accomplished young businessmen, to renowned sea captains, has at some point invested substantial energy into trying to win Ningguang's affection. One rumor even has it that a wealthy businessman from the Court of Fontaine signed a major trade deal with Liyue Harbor for the sole reason that it would mean he could see Ningguang more often.\nNingguang treats all her suitors with an equal measure of kindness and grace, but also keeps them at distance — enough to keep them interested but not push them away. Curiosity got the better of everyone in town, and now everyone wants to know: Who is Ningguang's lover? \nLittle do they know, Ningguang has no love for finite things, and will certainly not be bound by something that is finite.\nThe Jade Chamber, a floating palace above Liyue Harbor, belongs to Ningguang alone. It started out about the size of a room, but has since grown so large that in the moonlight it casts its shadow over the whole of Liyue.\nA portion of Ningguang's seemingly limitless wealth goes towards hiring skilled craftsmen to continue the expansion and refurbishment of the Jade Chamber, ensuring that it becomes ever more extravagant as time goes by.\nTo Ningguang, the Jade Chamber is a symbol of her wealth and power, and a sign that her business is flourishing.\nSave for Mora, it is the thing Ningguang loves most in the world — because it is infinite.\nOne day, she insists, it will cast its shadow over all the seven nations of Teyvat.",
            "Chess Game: Liyue Millennial\tNingguang invented a form of chess to pass the time.\nThis chessboard not only contains to-scale reproductions of Liyue Harbor's natural and urban geography, vendors, tea houses, shops, hotels and miscellaneous stores, but it also contains six, ten and twelve-sided dice (among others.) Players use the dice to determine how far their chess pieces move, and landing on various locations will trigger different events. Victory in-game is decided by the number of counters in each player's hands.\nThe rules can change at any time according to Ningguang's fancies, and when playing with others, she will always follow the newest rule set that she has on hand.\nWhen she's truly feeling the spirit, she will even design new rules on the spot — no one has yet beaten her at this game, and she has now reached the 32.6th edition of her rulebook.\nShe marketed the 8th edition of the game to the general public, believing it to be the easiest to understand, but it proved to still be far too complicated for ordinary folk.\nNonetheless, people flock to purchase sets on account of the beauty and intricacy of the model pieces.\nIn truth, more people buy it for the models than for the game.",
            "Vision\tNo one knows how Visions are created — they have always seemed to just appear out of thin air, leaving the countless unacknowledged in the lurch without a clue as to how to get one.\nAs for Visions left behind after their users die, they are masterless husks without any elemental power, nor is any method of reawakening them known, save for a tiny chance that it may resonate with another — and only one such \"other\" at a time...\nNingguang's first thought upon seeing such an object a subconscious \"oh, look, a new business opportunity.\"\nPutting this up for sale would surely have the rich shelling out for it. And if they can't resonate with it, why, they'll just use it to keep up appearances. A sound call either way...\nAnd if there should be a way to collect such empty shells, could this not become a long term business?\nPlaying with the jewel in one hand, Ningguang began writing plans for an auction in the other, her smile widening as she thought about the riches to be had — and at that moment, the Vision shone forth its light.\nNingguang's smile froze as the Vision activated.\nHer attendants, coming upon the sight of their mistress, awakened Vision in hand, began to congratulate her on having obtained a priceless treasure.\nNingguang, for her part, seemed annoyed instead.\n\"What's there to be happy about? Once broken, considered sold!\""

            "About Noelle: Discipline\tIn my job, I do the exact same things every day — a far cry from being a true knight, that's for sure. But ultimately, this is all part of my training, and when it comes to training, actions speak louder than words.",
            "About Noelle: Disagreement\tI'm a bit useless in an argument because I can't really explain my reasoning clearly. People find that hard to understand, so instead, I try to just get on with my work in my own way. But then they call me stubborn. All I try to do is convince people with results instead of trying to talk them round... Is that really stubborn of me?",
            "About Us: Identities\tI am devoted to what I do, but make no mistake — I devote myself freely. A maid, to me, is the most liberating job there is. I'm a chef, a gardener, a warrior, a guide... I can be anything you need me to be!",
            "About Us: Reminders\tEven when you're too busy to eat three square meals, never eat something if you don't know where it came from, and always maintain a balance between meat and vegetables. Oh, and no swimming right after a meal. Haha, I do hope you're not thinking, \"that's too much trouble, I'll just leave it to Noelle,\" are you? ... Oh... but of course, if you are... Well then, just leave it to me.",

            "About the Vision\tTo be honest, I'm feeling a little dejected. Sure, this Vision proves that the Archons think I'm worthy, but why is it a Geo Vision? I mean, Geo's the furthest thing from Anemo, and for a Knight of Favonius...",
            "Something to Share\tI actually really like the smell of wine, I'm just not of drinking age yet. There've been a few times when I could've had a little taste if I'd wanted, and no one would ever have known... but I resisted the temptation. I feel like the first time you try it is probably really magical, so I want to save it till I'm older.",

I—I had no idea the rose held such a... passionate meaning.",
            "About Amber\tI really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright I think. Oh no, please do not be alarmed. There's no risk of explosion whatsoever.",
            "About Klee\tI've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in solitary confinement...",
            "About Jean\tMaster Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!",
            "About Varka\tAt first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!",
            "About Kaeya\tHe's a mysterious character! He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, \"errand runner\"? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!",
            "About Bennett\tHe's asked me to join the Adventurers' Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius. While I could help him take care of his \"dads\" like the other adventurers... the Knights hold a special meaning for me, and I'm not ready to give up on becoming one yet. No, I simply cannot accept his offer.",
            "About Fischl: Tea\tI think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely... I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.",
            "About Fischl: Background\tSo once when I was cleaning the library, I noticed a book on the shelf called Flowers for Princess Fischl. At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her.",
            "About Barbara\tWe take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with Barbara.",
            "More About Noelle: I\tHow may I be of assistance? ...Oh, you just want to chat? Okay then! Well, if that's how I can help, then please feel free to chat as long as you'd like.",
            "More About Noelle: II\tNot a problem, I am here to serve in whatever capacity you require. You needn't be concerned about the way I feel. ...Huh? More tool than maid? I disagree! A tool might help you to complete a million tasks to a satisfactory standard, but it feels nothing. I, on the other hand, feel a strong sense of achievement every time I do something for you.",
            "More About Noelle: III\tTh—These treats are for me? Oh no, I couldn't, really. Well... Then I'll make some for you too! I'll go right now, right this instant! Half an hour... Ah, okay, maybe an hour, tops. You can busy yourself with other things first, and I'll be sure to deliver them right to you, hot and fresh out of the oven!",
            "More About Noelle: IV\tI spend all my days handling the most trivial of matters, but so long as it helps you in your adventure, or makes your life easier in some small way, I couldn't be happier. That's because each time I get a thank-you, it makes me feel like my work at least has some meaning, no matter how insignificant it seems.",
            "More About Noelle: V\tEven though I mostly work for the Knights of Favonius, I'm always looking out for ways I can help more people. These days, though, I seem to be spending more and more of my time with you... It might be a bit selfish of me... What do you think?",
            "Noelle's Hobbies\tMy hobby? I really like washing all sorts of things... clothes, floorboards, windows, you name it! Whenever I see something dirty, I just want to give it a good old clean! It gives me such a sense of achievement! ...Oh, you mean the things I do in my free time? Hmm... Same answer!",
            "Noelle's Troubles\tHow to get more for your Mora? Last time I went all the way to Liyue, I visited every single shop to compare prices, and then carried everything back myself... I won't be doing that again though. I was on the road for so long that Jean was convinced I'd been gobbled up by Stormterror along the way!",
            "Favorite Food\tMy favorite is easily a Satisfying Salad. The best of Mondstadt's natural produce on one plate — highly nutritious, and a low calorie count. No, I never get sick of eating it — it's delicious! I've been eating it for ten years now.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI'm not a fussy eater, but I really don't like banquets... The reason being, as the maid, I'm expected to sample every single dish on the table to ensure its quality. Just one bite of each, of course, but it all adds up... Oh, the guilt...",
            "Receiving a Gift: I\tHow can you make such a simple dish taste so good? My admiration towards you just keeps growing!",
            "Receiving a Gift: II\tThis tastes wonderful! Uh, would you mind teaching me how to make this? After all, it is my duty as a maid...",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tHmm... This is more than I normally eat in a whole day...",
            "Birthday\tSince you're always so busy adventuring, there must be so many little things you never get round to, surely? Well, you need not worry about them adding up, because today, I am all yours — your exclusive maid for the entire day! Just leave it all to me! ...Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you a very happy birthday!",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\tI cannot rest on my laurels. After all, I'm not even formally a knight yet. Until that day, I must work even harder.",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Climax\tThank you for the opportunity to accompany you on your adventures, it's taught me a lot and I believe I have improved a lot. As a maid, I should be the one serving you, but it seems you have done more for me than I could ever imagine...",
            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tEveryone in Mondstadt is saying that I'm much more reliable now. Some even say that I'm to be made a true knight soon, but I don't think— What? You think so too? Awwww... Thank you! Coming from you, that is the best compliment I could ever hope for!",

            "Character Details\tNoelle has much greater dreams and ambitions than other maids in the Knights of Favonius.\nLike anyone else in this city protected by the Knights of Favonius, she too dreams of donning the honored armor.\nEven if her skills are not enough to pass the rigorous selection trials, she still wishes to observe and learn from them every chance she gets.\nAside from her training, she enjoys her current life, helping everyone in need.\n\"You can leave absolutely anything to me!\"\nThat's her signature line. If there's anything that you need, Noelle is glad to be of aid.",
            "Character Story 1\tNoelle is \"the maid of all maids\" to many.\nSuch people also tend to say this of her: \"She's everywhere.\"\nFor example, there was a child who once tried to get a plate during a banquet, but found that there was no way to open the cabinet without all the plates falling out...\n\"Noelle!!!!!!\"\nAll the child needed to do was scream, and Noelle appeared. She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up other plates, and then put them back in order.\nNoelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.\nHowever, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter.\n\"No more, no less. As it should be, not as it should not be.\"\nNoelle doesn't think herself special, only that she thinks too much at times.",
            "Character Story 2\tNoelle is always eager to help, sometimes excessively so.\nIf you were to ask her how to build a campfire as she passed by, she would not only stop and build the campfire for you, she would also put up the grill racks, season the food, cook it for you, taste it herself to make sure it's done, and remind you to put out the fire when you've finished so as not to burn the forest down. Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.\nOf course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...\nFor example, a merchant from Snezhnaya once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.\nHe disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.\nInitially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.\nNoelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.\nThis spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?\nIn the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.\nNoelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously.",
            "Character Story 3\tMost of the time, Noelle's reliability provides a comforting presence, but there are always exceptions.\nOnce, she learned that an adventurer was trapped on Dragonspine, so she decided to mount a rescue by herself.\nThe snowstorm that day was terribly fierce, wiping out any tracks left by humans as soon as they were made. It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.\nHowever, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.\nAt the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.\nThe adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.\nIt was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.\nIn order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day.\nDuring the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few \"urgent matters\" for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over.",
            "Character Story 4\tNoelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength.\nThis does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength.\nOnce, Lisa accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand — and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.\nThere was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue — hurling the carts — cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.\nRumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion.\nIn all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.\nAt first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.\nPutting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.\nBut don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.\nThey say, however, that the very day Noelle received her custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb...\nLet's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky.",
            "Character Story 5\tNoelle's greatest enemy, curiously, is not a person, but Ludi Harpastum itself.\nDuring Ludi Harpastum, long tables arranged in a circular shape and filled with all kinds of food will be set up in the plaza before the Cathedral for everyone to enjoy.\nThe food is usually prepared by volunteers who can cook. During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.\nIt's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.\nThe crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering Pile 'Em Ups — all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.\nThe smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh.\nFor the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol.\nThe festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning.",
            "\"Warning of Roses\"\tThe maids of the Knights have many \"red lines\" that are not to be crossed, and one of these is that \"the personal information of the Knights must be kept in strict confidence.\"\nThis does not only require restricting outsider access to such information — this restriction also applies to other members of the Knights.\nFor example, what Jean keeps in her private quarters, the contents of Amber's Baron Bunny, the number of special eye patches that Kaeya owns, the number of Klee's hidden bomb caches... These things are all top secret.\nTo avoid leaking such information, Noelle used red cloth to make a great many roses — in Mondstadt, this flower means \"my lips are sealed.\"\nShe specially wove one such rose into her gauntlet as an ever-present reminder to herself.\nRevealing secrets would be a major dereliction of duty for a maid, and those who aspire to be knights cannot afford such errors.\nSo you can forget about probing Noelle for any secrets. She won't tell.",
            "Vision\tNoelle did once wish to fulfill her dream before its time. Some years ago, after failing her seventh selection test, which was really a foregone conclusion, she felt somewhat discouraged.\nThe etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?\nShe had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.\nAt that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.\nWithout a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.\nImmediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.\nBut just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.\nAfter a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.\nThis was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.\nHer hard work had been remembered after all.\nFrom that day forward, Vision in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable — and yes, everywhere at once too."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tDue to being a zombie, Qiqi lacks facial expression. She hopes that's okay.\nShe may look like a zombie, but she's surprisingly limber due to a strict calisthenics regimen.\nHer memory is poor. She forgets easily, and that is partly why she can seem cold to others.\nHer appearance is forever frozen at the point of her passing, so estimates of her age are unreliable.\nZombies require orders to act, but due to some reason or another, Qiqi is presently giving herself orders.",
            "Character Story 1\tUsually, zombies are cold and stiff, which forces them to locomote by hopping about.\nAs such, Qiqi keeps up a calisthenics regimen to retain a human-like form.\nThe 77th-generation Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, Hu Tao, doesn't see the point of all this. Whenever she meets Qiqi, she will say: \"It would be easier if you just let me bury you.\"\nQiqi, of course, has no wish to be buried, and so conducts her exercises at night when no one's about.\nQiqi's memory falls far behind those of non-undead disposition.\nIf she does not continue to reinforce her impressions of someone, she will completely forget them in three days tops.\nBut who knows, this might be a good thing — for a person with painful memories, forgetting may, in fact, be a form of release.\nThe person Qiqi must remember most... not only does this person have a very punch-able face, but she also shows up every single day.\nAs such, Qiqi isn't too concerned about her poor memory.",
            "Character Story 2\tQiqi is very petite indeed, but is in fact a very powerful zombie. Her short stature is hardly any impediment, but is instead good for high-speed movement.\nIn combat, Qiqi will unleash the self-control that she usually maintains, allowing her body to return to an undead state, increasing her strength and speed.\n\"You're dead.\"\nOnce she has stoically defeated her enemies, Qiqi will once again get her muscles under control, returning to her normal state.\nShe has been threatened in the past by Treasure Hoarders while picking herbs by herself.\nNow, a little girl, all by herself, seems like an easy target, no?\nWho would have thought that this girl could send a whole crew flying?\nThis is why we should always remember never to judge a person based on appearances. Or a zombie, for that matter.",
            "Character Story 3\tZombies mostly require orders from the person who awakens them to move. But strictly speaking, Qiqi has never been awakened.\nAs such, she counts as a very rare case of a zombie that gives itself orders.\nIf these orders are simple ones like \"defeat the enemy,\" Qiqi has no problem fulfilling them.\nBut when faced with complex instructions such as \"go to Jueyun Karst, climb the sheer rock faces and pick herbs,\" Qiqi sometimes winds up stuck below the cliffs, unable to give up no matter how many times she tries and fails to scale the cliff.\nThe method to cancel her orders is very simple — hug Qiqi from behind, tell her something like \"I love you the most,\" and the orders will dissipate, just like that.\nUnfortunately, there's just no element of sincerity when Baizhu does it, leading to greatly reduced results.\nPerhaps someday, someone will come along who understands that such words cannot be spoken lightly, and who slowly but carefully releases the hold that Qiqi's orders have over her...\nWhat will Qiqi's response be then?",
            "Character Story 4\tThis ancient story has long been forgotten by mortals.\nAn ordinary herb-picking lass named Qiqi lost her way and trespassed the realm of the adepti. Injuring her right leg in a fall, she hurriedly hid in a cavern to rest.\nEven occupied as she was in bandaging her wound, she could hear sounds that did not belong to the mortal plane. But she could have never expected that with a huge crash, she would forever be trapped between life and death.\nWhether adepti or demons, just or wicked, all understood that she was an innocent mortal caught in the crossfire.\nOr perhaps it was by the will of heaven that she received a Vision in her dying moments, and so ended this contention between adepti and demon.\nThe adepti could not bear to let her die, and each imparted to her a portion of their strength, meaning to breathe life back into her body.\nQiqi did indeed awaken and live again, but went into a berserk state, unable to control the adepti energy raging through her.\nSeeking to end the disturbance, Mountain Shaper had no choice but to seal the hapless maiden in amber.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter hundreds of years, Qiqi was discovered by humans, still trapped in the amber, and was brought to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for burial.\nThe mountain roads were treacherous, however, and the amber was bumped about. Coupled with the passing of many years, the seal on Qiqi was all but spent.\nShe awakened in the middle of the night, broke the amber in secret, and fled.\nFollowing the herb-picking habits of her previous life, Qiqi headed right for the hills.\nBy chance, she met Baizhu, the boss of Bubu Pharmacy, on the way, and he took her in.\nNow, Baizhu was a doctor of great skill, but he was hardly a man of high caliber or great courage.\nEven so, he took her in, never mind that her memory was so poor that she could not even sort herbs out.\nIt does seem that his acceptance of Qiqi has something to do with his own personal pursuits.\nQiqi is stiff, but not slow, and has long realized this. However, she does not take it to heart.\nPerhaps she has seen too much, or been alone for too long... But what remains true is that she treasures his concern, even if there is some other motive behind it.",
            "A Home-and-Away Handbook of Practical Wisdom for the Undead\tQiqi carries something with her that looks like a notebook.\nQiqi's memory is very poor, so it is an object of irreplaceable importance if she is to smoothly go about her daily life.\nThe words within are written in a centuries-old style, and are very elegant indeed.\nThe first page is an instructional on calisthenics.\nMoving past that, one finds the descriptions of various herbs and some \"orders.\"\nQiqi needs to give herself orders, so she has very precise instructions to ensure smooth transition.\nShe has also dutifully written down all the things she needs to do in a day.\nRecently, she has also added a section on \"brain training\" and \"mnemonic methods.\"\nAt this point, it has become a true \"dummy's guide\" on just about anything.\nBut if the day ever comes when Qiqi also forgets to look at her notebook... there would truly be nothing for it then.",
            "Vision\tQiqi's Vision was given to her in the last moment of her life.\nShe wanted to stop the clock from turning. She wanted to live happily again.\nShe feared death. She wanted to live. She missed her family... These feelings coalesced at last into \"ice.\"\n\"If only I could freeze time... How wonderful would that be?\"\nAs she thought thus, tears fell from the moribund girl's eyes upon the Vision that had appeared before her.\nThe mighty and illuminated adepti all acknowledged this as a legitimate form of \"illumination\" — the yearning of humanity for bygone days is, after all, a desire to protect that past."

This is the anchor point of their cognition and is the foundation of all reason.\nThe world of the people of Inazuma is also thus. There, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain were primordial facts of life, as well as light, and the sea... and the Raiden Shogun.\nBabes nestling in their mothers' arms hear tales of the Shogun's slaying of many gods and conquering of other races.\nWhen young men and women roam the islands, they see the gorge split asunder by a blade of lightning and the pale, still-standing bones of the giant snake.\nSoldiers take to the battlefield with \"glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!\" upon their lips.\nThe people work in contentment and peace, knowing that the Shogun and her loyal Tri-Commission are there.\nThe great name of the Raiden Shogun has long shaken off the shackles of mere life, becoming the eternal traditional belief of Inazuma.\nPeople trust in this great name and its might, believing that their descendants shall witness the same sights, that the same faith will form the foundations of their inner worlds, and that this will pass on from generation to generation.\nThis is the eternal paradise that the Almighty Shogun promised her people.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe true name of the Raiden Shogun is \"Raiden Ei.\"\nIn her long road, she has witnessed the price that Inazuma has had to pay for progress over the hundreds and thousands of years.\nThe happiest years of her life had passed her by, and those she once considered friends became her foes. In the end, she even lost the reason for which she had wielded her sword.\n\"Where there is progress, there must be loss.\"\nEi believed that this was the iron-clad rule of the world, with time as its merciless enforcer.\nThe greatest and most prosperous nation of men collapsed overnight, and even that most ancient Liyue Harbor would say farewell to its Geo Archon. The winds of parting came whistling in from the outer edge of time.\nHowever resounding the Raiden Shogun's name, centuries later, millennia later... Someday, Inazuma would lose the protection of its deity.\nAs a warrior, she was wary of all foes. Even if that enemy was a crisis as intangible as time's passage, she had to find a countermeasure, a weapon she could use to defeat it in time.\nHer answer? \"Eternity.\" Only Eternity could freeze all things under the sky, make Inazuma truly deathless.\n\"Then, while things are still good, let us have stillness... Let us march towards Eternity.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tFor beings with a perishable form of flesh to pursue Eternity, they must first solve the unavoidable problem of lifespan.\nThis limited time troubled Ei greatly, until one day when a mysterious technique came before her eyes as if by a stroke of fate.\nUsing such techniques, one could create intricate puppets indistinguishable from true life.\nIn theory, this puppet could perfectly imitate everything about Ei. It could surpass the limits of her lifespan and defend Inazuma forever. Yet, how could creating a copy of an Archon be a simple affair?\nEi conducted countless experiments to this effect, discarded a great many failed products, and spent an unimaginable amount of time and resources—\nBut at last, by her dogged pursuit and warrior's spirit, she was able to create a flawless puppet.\nThe newborn Raiden Shogun sat there silently, listening to Ei speak all about her, \"her,\" and even about them. The future of Inazuma was here, inscribed upon a gorgeous blueprint.\nThe automaton had but one question to ask Ei: \"There is no turning back from forsaking your form. Do you regret nothing?\"\n\"Your existence is my answer.\"\nThen, Ei transferred her consciousness into her blade, and thus was born the Plane of Euthymia.",
            "Character Story 3\tBefore Raiden Ei became the Shogun, she was a samurai responsible for seeing that the previous Shogun's orders were carried out.\nThe previous Electro Archon, Raiden Makoto, was no great fighter, and the things Ei had charge over were mostly matters of warfare and slaughter. However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.\nDue to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the Kitsune Saiguu reserved for the winners.\nThus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or Mikoshi Chiyo for karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.\nAt last, the day came that under a sakura tree's shade, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty tengu would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.\nEi let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade.\n Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.\nAs for the Kitsune Saiguu, oh, how amused she looked as she presented Ei with some pastries.\n\"I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content.\"\nEi was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.\n—But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely — just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.\nTo this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree.\n...Even though she has not gone to see it in a long time, and even though no one sits under it anymore, she wishes that time might stop forever.",
            "Character Story 4\tEi still remembers the way in which Makoto greatly loved the scenery of Inazuma, its cuisine, and the stories of its people — and how she loved telling Ei all about them.\nThough they both understood the concept of erosion well, Makoto was unlike Ei, who worried about the future more often. Instead, Makoto's energies were focused on the present.\n\"It is precisely because we know that this scene is but a fleeting shadow that we should enjoy it all the more.\"\nThen, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun. She thought to herself that she must learn to be more leisurely, just like Makoto.\nYet the times changed all too quickly, all but catching Ei off guard. Before she knew it, her hands already held the blade that the dying Raiden Makoto had passed on to her.\nThis day, the kagemusha was now the true Raiden Shogun.\nAnd it was on this day that Ei truly felt the agony of erosion.\nAs time marched forward inexorably, even this blade, this sakura... All life on Inazuma would fade before her eyes.\nThis was the foundation of Inazuma, and it was the thing that the Raiden Shogun must defend.\n\"If you look at it this way, thinking ahead is not meaningless, nor is it vain arrogance.\"\nHaving resolved herself, her life exceeded its mortal shell, and eternity descended upon the mortal plane.",
            "Character Story 5\tOne night, Raiden Ei entered a beautiful dreamscape while meditating.\nHere, there was nothing left between heaven and earth but her, and a \"her\" that was akin to looking into a mirror.\nThe automaton's voice flowed into her ears like a sigh: \"the eternity you resolved to establish in your heart has been shaken by the countless wishes of the people. Thus, you have become my enemy.\"\nBack when she was creating the puppet, Ei had considered all the hidden risks involved.\nShe believed that anything was possible — including the worst-case scenario... in which she too would someday become a threat to Eternity.\nBut she had to press on. She had to reach Eternity. This, she would not permit to be stayed by any outside force.\nThe puppet's words were something that she had asked herself long ago:\n\"You believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. Thus, you believe your present self is correct. Don't you?\"\n\"But have you really been enlightened with new ideas? Or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?\"\nTheir faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. The battle with herself, with her past, would come someday.\nBut it was not this day. Ei knew well that she was not yet ready.\nHer heart had been clear, and she would have remained in that state, but hearing the cries of her people, she had to command her feet to stop.\nThe sky above the mirror was no longer empty, and all about the silent halls, she heard the cry of crows. Dawn was coming. The samurai must take up her sword.\nThis dream was ever so real, and it, too, passed like a shadow.",
            "Musou Isshin\tA sword that, once passed on, has accompanied Ei to this day.\nThis sword has had two wielders, and has witnessed both time and eternity.\nIt was born from Raiden Makoto's divine might, but it was never once sharpened. It took after its owner, of course, for Makoto was not one for battle. It was but a symbol, a sign of true peace.\nThe day Makoto passed on, it was given into Ei's hands. The sword was stained with blood, then, and as the blade drew its first taste of crimson, the dripping ichor was blown aside by wild winds and blazing thunder.\nMakoto gave it the name Musou Isshin, and desired to have it witness an Inazuma as lovely as a dream and the noble hearts that dwell in this world.\nEi did not change its name. For she, too, had looked out over that vast scene of beauty, and the sight of it had engendered a stronger, purer dream in her own heart.\nThe aesthetic of lightning is precisely to capture that which is precious amidst fleeting transience.",
            "Gnosis\tBefore she came to dwell in the Plane of Euthymia permanently, Ei was troubled for a time concerning where she might store her Gnosis.\nShe no longer had any need of it, but such an important item could not simply be placed anywhere. She had initially intended to have it modified into a energy supply device, but no matter what she did, her techniques had no effect on the Gnosis at all.\nAnd that was when she thought of someone: the cunning and clever Yae Miko. She was not precisely someone to be trusted, but she was in many ways also Ei's best choice.\nUpon hearing this request, Miko could not help but joke: \"Aren't you afraid that I might just sell this off?\"\n\"You understand the value of a Gnosis. Even if you sold it, I trust that you would have exchanged it for something of equal value, and that is no easy price to pay.\"\nWith someone of Yae Miko's character, it would be no surprise if she ever sold the Gnosis, yes, but she would not allow herself to lose out in any such exchange.\nSuch, then, was the tacit agreement between the two old friends. Yae Miko understood Ei's intent and took the precious Gnosis with a smile.\n\"Well, this is your idea, not mine. Don't end up regretting this, now.\""

            "Character Details\tRazor is a boy whose identity is shrouded in mystery. He lives in Wolvendom and is rarely spotted by the citizens of Mondstadt.\nAccording to a handful of eyewitness accounts, Razor has keen senses and is highly agile, traversing the forest at breakneck speed. He is often seen in the company of his wolf pack, while generally avoiding contact with humans.\nSome speculate that he was an orphan raised by the wolves, while others say he is a wolf spirit that has taken on a human form.\nSuch rumors only add to the mystery of the \"Wolf Boy,\" as the denizens of Mondstadt call him.\nMeanwhile, Razor the Wolf Boy stands all the while on the hilltops with his head held high, basking in the warm sunlight.",
            "Character Story 1\tRazor lives among the wolves night and day.\nAll of them are as close with Razor as they could possibly be. Which wolf has the loudest howl, which wolf runs the fastest, which wolf is the best at ambushing — there isn't a wolf Razor doesn't know.\nHe can sense the mood of the wind, smell a scent from miles away, and knows many practical applications for plants of all kinds. The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.\nWhat kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.\nHis memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun. The wolves took him in as part of their \"Lupical\" — a word he was taught by someone else, which means family.",

Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.\nRazor looks at his body and then at the bodies of his kin.\nHe knows he is different from them.\nBut there's nothing wrong with that, as far as Razor is concerned.",
            "Character Story 3\tOne day, a tall man came to the mountains and disrupted Razor's peaceful life.\nRazor did not know who the man was, only that he was a human. Seeing the confused look on Razor's face, the man gave him a friendly smile.\n\"Hey buddy! Why don't you come back down to Mondstadt with me?\"\nThe man offered his hand to Razor as he spoke.\nBut neither Razor nor the wolves understood the gesture. Feeling protective, the wolves placed themselves between Razor and the man to keep him away.\nRazor ducked down beneath the wolves' furry tails. He looked at his body, and then peered out through the gaps in the wolf fur to get a look at the man's.\nRazor knew he wasn't the most intelligent of beings, and was at a loss to answer the question that has been in his mind ever since that day.\n\"Am I a human, or a wolf?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tIt was that man who gave Razor his name.\nThe simple Wolf Boy could not understand the intricacies of human language, but he knew from the look on the man's face when he produced this sound that the man was giving him a name.\n\"Rae-zer.\"\nThe shadows cast by the trees of Wolvendom grew short, and then grew long again.\nThe man taught Razor how to swing a sword. Unwieldy though this steel claw may be, thought Razor, it was at least sharp enough to cut through tree branches.\n\"Now you can protect your friends.\"\n\"Fr-ren-dzz...\"\nRazor imitated the sounds the man made, without understanding what they meant.\nSimilarly, he did not understand why the names of things were all that important in the first place. After all, he never learned the name of that man before he left.",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Master, what is... 'friends'?\"\nRazor once asked of his new mentor, working at the limits of his vocabulary.\nHis purple-clothed mentor seemed to know it all, from how to make hash browns from potatoes in the ground, to the name of the brightest star in the summer night sky.\nHowever, Lisa simply smiled and yawned without answering him.\nRazor thought about it when the wind blew, when the rain fell — even when Wolfhook berries got stuck in his fur. He just couldn't figure it out.\nUntil one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.\nThey stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together — she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.\nHer name was Klee. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again.\n\"Friends... is...

            "Character Details\tRosaria is one of the sisters of Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.\nThough she is just as much a woman of the cloth as the likes of Barbara and Jilliana, people tend to make a mental distinction between Rosaria and other members of the clergy.\nWhile she might dress the part — at least, to a certain extent — her speech and actions do not reflect her office in the slightest.\nFurthermore, she displays even less reverence towards the gods than the ordinary citizens, and she routinely skips her various church engagements.\nShe comes, goes, and acts in solitude, and if she were ever to make an appearance in the Cathedral, it would be to smoke in the rearmost pew.\nSuch a lone wolf is Rosaria that perhaps she should be considered a clergywoman in name only.",
            "Character Story 1\tIf Rosaria has been lectured once, she has been lectured a thousand times before concerning her unorthodox behavior.\nFor some reason, however, she has never faced any serious consequences for her transgressions. She does not work together with her church colleagues and only rarely shows up to celebratory events in the city.\nThe strange and mysterious Rosaria moves about almost like a wisp of black smoke — blink, and you'll miss her as she disappears into thin air.\nHer social interactions are never more than superficial, and the rest of the time she keeps herself to herself.\nHowever, Sister Victoria would say that the ever good-natured Barbara is one person who has always made the effort to get close to Rosaria.\n\"Please don't smoke in the Cathedral...\" \"Could you try to attend the ceremony on time next time...?\"\n\"And... Hey, come back, I'm still talking to you!\"\nBarbara is forever anxiously chasing after Rosaria, urging her to complete her various daily tasks.\nYet even when faced with Barbara, the beloved idol of Mondstadt, Rosaria remains completely unmoved.\nSurely her heart can't be completely made of stone?",
            "Character Story 2\tRosaria's movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone and can be gone for up to several days on end.\nDuring these times, none of her church colleagues know where to find her.\nOne of the sisters who took it upon herself to observe Rosaria once groused that \"even a stray cat should at least give you notice before running off...\"\nRosaria uses these disappearances to do work that only she can do in corners unseen by others.\nAn unfamiliar merchant, a suspicious traveler — are these people threats to Mondstadt?\nShe investigates, shadows, and if necessary, interrogates.\nIf they must disappear, then Rosaria shall be the last person they meet.\nSuch dark work, which cannot see the light of day, is to be done by her hand alone.\nShe always sets out after the sun has set, finishing her work in one fell swoop. Sometimes, if she makes it back by the crack of dawn, she gets to usher in the day ahead with a glass of breakfast wine.\nThe people of Mondstadt live in the golden sunlight, but Rosaria dwells under the silver moonlight.\nIt is a cold, piercing light... just like that of the ice she forms with her Cryo abilities.\n\"There are some things that young people need not know,\" Rosaria thinks.\nThough, in her eyes, \"young people\" means all citizens of Mondstadt who live in the light of the sun, regardless of their age.",
            "Character Story 3\tLike a puff of smoke, the lackadaisical Rosaria is impossible to pin down.\nNevertheless, once she takes on a job, she can be relied on to handle it with the utmost professionalism.\n\"Lazy\" is the last word that anyone would use to describe her ruthless interrogations of suspicious individuals.\nShe also possesses exceptional strength and knows the weaknesses of the human body like the back of her hand — and has no reservations about using this knowledge to kill.\nPeople know her as the lazy, chain-smoking sister, but behind the scenes, she is a formidable purveyor of justice.\nA strange fate for one who ostensibly basks in the light of the gods.\nWhat led her to become a blood-soaked slayer? Why does she stay silent while others praise the gods for their protection?\nPerhaps it should come as no surprise that Rosaria was not born and bred in Mondstadt.\n\"A city that is fortunate enough to be boring always needs someone to do the dirty work...\"\nRosaria stubs her cigarette out as she speaks in her characteristically languid manner.\n\"And as far as I'm concerned, the things I deal with are far simpler than living the life of a traditional sister.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tRosaria may not be one to attend prayer meetings, but that does not mean she doesn't have her own theological viewpoints.\nIn her view, freedom is the spiritual pillar of Mondstadt's people, and it is the very thing that caused her to end up here in the first place.\nRosaria was born in a remote mountain village, but was taken from her home shortly after birth by the very same bandits who drenched it in blood.\nRaised by those crooks, she learned how to fight, sometimes thieving, other times doing odd jobs for the crew.\nShe was their servant, but also their tool, a crook, yet still a child.\nShe fought against outsiders and her comrades alike, and growing up was a constant battle for survival against the hunger and cold.\nRosaria's youth was just like Mondstadt's sunset — blood-red from horizon to horizon, and so fleeting that night had fallen before she'd had the chance to stop and take in the view.\nUltimately, the bandit crew was wiped out by the Knights of Favonius. As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.\nGrand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:\n\"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life.\"\nBut Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.\nShe would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.\nFor Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness.",
            "Character Story 5\tRosaria, the Church's number one truant, became infamous for her absence very early on.\n\"Miss Rosaria, please, show a little more circumspection in your actions! You are a member of the Church. How is it appropriate that you simply never turn up for hymn practice?\"\n\"Please calm down, Sister Ophila. Miss Rosaria, I'm told that you have never attended a single one of your compulsory classes. Is that so?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Mother Maria, please look at this... Rosaria's theological essay is an utter mess!\"\n\"Miss Rosaria, if I may ask frankly... do you intend to do any work at all here at the Church?\"\n\"No. I've already found other work.\"\nRosaria never showed so much as a hint of anxiety in any of these exchanges. What's more, it was true — she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.\nThe unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.\nRosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.\nNevertheless, when she's not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.\nAnd when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.\nThe instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.\nWhether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime.",
            "Church-Issue Journal\tA journal with a white cover. The words \"Church of Favonius\" are inscribed on the cover.\nThe handwriting is beautiful, but the content is the most of the most banal variety imaginable.\n\"Dandelion Wine — now eighty percent off!\"\n\"Fisherman's Toast — an incredible flavor at an unbelievable price!\"\n\"Crazy discounts on Wheat — ask at the counter and we'll grind it into Flour for you.\"\n\"Buy three Tomatoes and get one free!\"\n\"Fresh Small Lamp Grass! Use it to light up your bathroom! Come on, Sir, have a look!\"\nThere is something incongruous about a random assortment of marketplace cries and advertising slogans having been penned by such a graceful and elegant hand.\nThis journal is a relic from Rosaria's novice days.\nClearly, she must have skipped class and headed to the rooftops on the merchant street, bathing in the sun, listening to the eclectic cries of the street vendors, and committing them to paper.",
            "Vision\tRosaria's Vision came to her on a particularly frigid night.\nThings were getting desperate for the bandit gang — people were starving and the food supplies were dwindling.\nNever able to eat her fill, Rosaria was driven by hunger to flee into the freezing wind rather than continue another second with the hard labor she was forced to endure.\nOne of the elders of the gang pursued her and brought her back.\nHe was the very person who had taken her from the village of her birth, and the one who had taught her how to kill.\n\"Fleeing makes you a traitor, and traitors can only earn their freedom through victory in combat.\"\nThe old bandit tossed Rosaria an old dagger.\n\"Well, come on then! Kill me, and you can leave this place. I'm long in the tooth now, while you've got youth on your side. You can do this, can't ya?\"\nNo one thought that she would be able to kill him — and yet, the old lion would indeed fall by the newborn cub's claws.\nThus did the bandits lose an old member and welcome a new one that very night.\nThe bandits were reluctant to accept Rosaria at first since she had slain one of their own, but they quickly had a change of heart after seeing the Vision in her hand.\nSurely, a Vision wielder had to be far stronger than some old coot who was about to kick the bucket right? And she ate less, to boot... They could save some food this way.\nMeanwhile, a question crept into Rosaria's frozen heart:\nDid he let me replace him on purpose? ...Could a false father have harbored genuine affection for a child he stole so arbitrarily?"

            "About Shikanoin Heizou\tInitially, I was astonished to see anyone coming to Watatsumi Island wearing a Tenryou Commission uniform. A Tenryou Commission samurai would never be that brazen, and a Tenryou Commission spy would never be that conspicuous. Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed \"detective\" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs. Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island. Be sure to talk to him if the chance ever presents itself.",

            "More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: II\tLegend has it that our ancestors lived in a palace in the depths of the ocean, and that the god, Orobashi, brought us to the surface. I've often wondered, wouldn't a palace like that be too dark? Every time I think about it, I start to really appreciate the light...",
            "More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: III\tAfter you left, the soldiers of Swordfish II nominated a temporary captain, but everyone was hoping that you'd return. I could only tell them that you'd been tasked with an important solo mission. If you get the chance, you should go visit them, I'm sure they'd love to see you.",
            "More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: IV\tA long time ago, I had no intention of becoming the Divine Priestess. My only goal was to study military strategy and become an adviser. That way, I could remain behind the scenes and lessen my overall burden. *sigh* Fate had other ideas in store... You can't defy that which flows in your veins.",

            "Sangonomiya Kokomi's Hobbies\tHuh? What do I enjoy? Simple. I like to find a quiet place by myself and read books on strategy... Ahh, the whole day, without interruption. I'd be even happier if we looked over some of it together. One thing though... You'd have to sleep on the floor.",
            "Sangonomiya Kokomi's Troubles\tTo be quite honest, I'm not particularly skilled at communicating with others. Putting on my \"Divine Priestess airs\" certainly makes things easier, but once I run out of energy, I start to get a bit negative. I prevent others from seeing that side of me at all costs. The people of Watatsumi Island need a perfect leader, not some girl who likes to wile away her time at home.",
            "Favorite Food\tI just love eating Bird Egg Sushi. The ingredients are easy to find, and it's simple to prepare... Ah... perfect for military life. Sitting down to eat Bird Egg Sushi in the midst of war might seem a bit extravagant, but in most cases, simple food like this brings great satisfaction to the soldiers.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tMm... If I had to say, I'm not fond of any sort of seafood. But please, keep this strictly confidential. The fishing industry is essential to Watatsumi Island, and if word were to get out that seafood wasn't my thing, I'm afraid morale would be gravely affected.",

First, I'll take you out at daybreak to see the sunrise, then we can go diving during the heat of the day. In the evening, we can go for a stroll around Sangonomiya Shrine.

            "Character Details\tThe inhabitants of Watatsumi Island once lived in Enkanomiya, at the bottom of the sea.\nIt was only by the grace of the god Orobaxi bringing them up to the surface that the civilization of Watatsumi Island exists today.\nWhen Orobaxi was slain by the Electro Archon, its body was left as a skeleton and its resentment permeated the land, giving rise to Tatarigami.\nYet its desire to protect Watatsumi Island never faded. This will lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan, and follows them from generation to generation.\nThe current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess.\nThe meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe day Kokomi ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, countless inhabitants of Watatsumi Island came to Sangonomiya Shrine of their own accord to see her.\nSurprise, suspicion, confusion, chuckles... Their expressions were strange, all on account of her overly-young appearance in their eyes.\nPlots were hatched and questions were endless. The ambitious planned to make their move. The storm was approaching, and all was not at peace on Watatsumi Island.\nYet all went back to business as usual not long after Kokomi ascended to her position.\nShe was fair in distributing rewards and punishments alike, appreciated the contributions of the people, and was militarily skilled. Her many abilities quickly won the hearts of most of the people.\n\"Things will be alright as long as Her Excellency is here\" soon became the most widespread saying on the island.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere are many factors involved in deciding victory or defeat.\nTerrain, weather, differences in military strength and equipment quality... All of these require careful consideration.\nThose who study the details too closely tend to miss changes on the field, and most who speak of strategy speak of it in a vacuum.\nOnly those who can grasp both the big picture and the small details can create miracles on the battlefield.\nAnd behind all this lies countless hours of hard work delving into the reasons behind one's failures.\nFew if any ever persevere to the end, but Kokomi was not only good at this but also possessed a unique tactical style.\n\"Manipulate the larger strategic situation to force the other side to give up, and to win wars with the least amount of cost possible.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tWhether on the battlefield or off it, Kokomi tries to \"know thy enemy\" as much as possible.\nShe tends to predict all possible scenarios beforehand and devise strategies to address them, which are then delivered as directives to those who enforce her will.\nThis has given rise to the issue of some of these directives being rather thick and heavy, but this method has guaranteed the stable development of Watatsumi Island.\nToday, Watatsumi Island moves each day towards greater prosperity, and as more talented people have been appointed to office, the directives that Kokomi has to deliver have decreased.\nAs far as she is concerned, that is something worth celebrating.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen Kokomi has the time to spare, she will go on walks on Watatsumi Island alone.\nShe often tries to avoid crowds, pacing slowly through the violet forests, sometimes sitting by the seaside and looking out into the distance.\nThe sun and the moon rise over the sea, the stars shine in their skies, and the sound of the waves is pleasing to the ear, relaxing the soul.\nSometimes she will even place a seashell on her head, only to put it back where she found it when she leaves.\nIn her mind, perhaps some wandering crab will burrow its way inside and call this shell home.\nSometimes, Kokomi will also go diving, enjoying the calm atmosphere by herself, her worries sinking into the ocean depths as schools of fish swim all around her.\nKokomi treasures every sight there is to be seen on Watatsumi Island, and she remembers the name of every person.\nSadly, while scenery remains, people's hearts are complex and changeable.\nVictory is simple enough to attain compared to the mammoth task of making sure that everyone lives happily.\nThis dilemma has always troubled her.",
            "Character Story 5\tKokomi has been well-read since she was young, and has a particular love for military treatises.\nAs such, Kokomi has a broad store of knowledge to be used in every field.\nBut another result of her constantly being buried in such treatises of war and illustrated military texts is that Kokomi lacks skill in social interaction. She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.\nHaving ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.\nHowever, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.\nAs such, Kokomi set up an \"energy\" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.\nWhen she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.\nEngrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world — thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.\nThese moments are of utmost value to her.",
            "Secret Notes\t\"As the ruler is, so shall the people be.\"\nThis precept was something Kokomi heard from her mother a long time ago.\nThe Divine Priestess' role is one of utmost importance to Watatsumi Island, and its people's eyes are always upon her every move.\nThe things she loves will be in fashion, and the things she dislikes, the people will also distance themselves from.\nKokomi, in truth, has no wish to affect the people's lives, and as such has rarely ever revealed much of her personal likes or dislikes.\nShe treats all things with an egalitarian manner, and holds \"fairness of judgment\" and \"justice in dispensing rewards and punishment\" to be her guiding principles.\nHowever, these are not necessarily her true feelings, and so she prepared a book of secret notes for herself.\nHere, she records the fluctuations in both her energy levels and mood.\nWhen the night deepens and the world falls silent, Kokomi will open this book and write the day's experiences, whether they be joyous, sad, or frustrating.\n...Of course, this object is for her eyes only — and so it must remain.",
            "Vision\tA leader with a strong will can lead those around them in a clear direction.\nHowever, Kokomi lacks such strong ideals. Instead, she respects the will of the people and wishes that they can each find their own way.\nJust as the vast ocean can accommodate countless souls and their individual desires, so does Kokomi wish her rule could be.\nWhen the Vision Hunt Decree came about, the resentment of the people turned into cries of revolt, and so Kokomi led them in raising the banner of resistance.\nAnd once the war was over, the hearts of the people turned towards peace and stability, and so did Kokomi direct her energies towards governance and economics.\nBut what was the source of this toil? Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?\nAs the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision. And ever since the day she looked out at the sea outside Sangonomiya Shrine, her wish has never once changed—\n\"I wish to protect all of Watatsumi Island and allow its people to lead happy lives.\""

            "Character Story 1\tSayu is petite and can even be described as delicate.\nThis is also something that bothers her —\nOne by one, her peers are growing taller, but she still has the stature of a child, as her height has not changed at all.\nSayu is really anxious about this matter.\nDay by day, the world seems to be sprouting skyward, and only she remains small as ever.\nGrowing taller has gradually become an obsession in Sayu's mind.\n\"As long as I sleep long enough, I can definitely grow taller!\"\nShe came to believe this ever so firmly, seizing every opportunity to sleep as much as possible, creating every opportunity and circumstance, even when there were none.\nPeople around little Sayu often let her be, as they don't have the heart to disturb her sleep.\nSo now, the situation has progressed such that Sayu is able to fall asleep, even whilst standing.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe ninjutsu that Sayu has learned is not very powerful in combat, but it is quite useful in the matter of slacking off.\nShe is extremely skilled at hiding and covering her tracks, and is an expert in this area. Therefore, if she has the intention to hide, ordinary people absolutely cannot find her.\nHowever, even the most ingenious puzzles have answers, and even the most elusive treasures have clues for people to find them. This also holds true for Sayu.\nAfter spending enough time with Sayu, one will understand her habits and preferences. Trying to find her doesn't seem so difficult anymore.\nFor example, if you go to Sayu's room early in the morning and lift the covers, the odds are that you will find her in bed.\nAt noon, you can check out the trees near the shrine and who knows, you may find something unexpected.\nIt will be more challenging to find Sayu at night, but it's a good idea to go to her house and wait for her to emerge.\nHowever, please remember not to disturb Sayu, who is busy growing taller, unless it is absolutely necessary.\nEven gentle rabbits bite when provoked, let alone Sayu...",
            "Character Story 3\tThat said, finding Sayu doesn't mean that she can be put to work quietly.\nMoreover, Sayu's work at the Shuumatsuban is not that of a fixed daily routine, but missions that pop up if and as needed.\nAnd so, this happens:\nWhen new missions are assigned, you won't see hide or tail of her.\nBy the time she has been found (and with much effort), a more suitable person has been assigned for the mission.\nAnd in case there is no other suitable candidate other than Sayu, all the more she will try to slip away, so as not to be overwhelmed by the mission.\nIt's just that... If Sayu used her ninjutsu to work hard, she would have had great accomplishments in the Shuumatsuban.",
            "Character Story 4\tSayu is the last successor to the Ninjutsu Art — Yoohoo Art.\nIn this school of ninjutsu, which is known for teasing its enemies, Sayu has learned only ninjutsu such as escape and clone techniques.\nThese ninjutsu are of little use in actual combat, but have an undeniable aesthetic flair.\nAmongst falling leaves, a silhouette vanishes in a flash, a gentle breeze blows, and a kite suddenly appears on the ground... The incredible scene is comparable to an artistic performance.\nThus, whenever there is a festival, Sayu will be invited by various parties to perform her mysterious ninjutsu.\nIf it's Yoimiya who's searching for her, Sayu can still find ways to hide.\nBut if the person in question is Lady Guuji Yae, resistance is futile for Sayu.\nClone techniques do nothing to fool the Lady Guuji's sharp eyes, and aura concealment doesn't help Sayu at all in escaping from the Lady Guuji's grasp.\nRunning for the hills is even less feasible, and might even risk angering the Lady Guuji...\nFortunately, there are very few circumstances that require Lady Guuji Yae to make a personal appearance.",
            "Character Story 5\tFor as long as Sayu can remember, she has been studying ninjutsu with her sensei in the Shuumatsuban.\nAlthough the Shuumatsuban is a clandestine organization, the elders are very kind and have taken good care of young Sayu.\n\"Being overly reliant on others is never a good thing for a ninja.\"\nAfter Sayu had reached a bottleneck in learning ninjutsu, her sensei observed her situation and thought thusly.\nAs the years passed, Sayu grew steadily. Once she was capable enough to defend herself, her sensei chose to leave quietly.\nA young animal that leaves the protection of its parents will grow up rapidly. The same is true of the sensei's expectations for Sayu.\nThe young ninja did not disappoint her sensei. Soon after, Sayu obtained a Vision.\nAnd then, she started working diligently in the Shuumatsuban... diligently shirking her duties.\nSayu is always busy sleeping and hiding from people, so in that sense, she also has a lot to do.\nOccasionally, when Sayu is free and alone to enjoy the moonlight, she feels lost deep inside.\nThe people who have always been with you will one day leave...is this how life is meant to be?\nBut perhaps someday in the future, I will also meet the person who will always be with me.\nPondering the matter, the little ninja fell asleep again...",
            "Mini Mujina\tSayu's outfit is said to be a gift from her sensei.\nThe style references the form of a small animal — the \"mujina,\" and Sayu's favorite colors were also specially chosen for it.\nIt is light and flexible, thus making it suitable for a ninja.\nSayu is especially fond of the huge hood, as it brings about a sense of security.\nThe long tail is designed for Sayu to maintain balance on the branches.\nAs for the only drawback... this outfit probably looks too much like a tanuki, and Sayu often gets misunderstood because of it.\nInitially, she would seriously explain to the other party that:\n\"I'm not a tanuki, I'm Sayu.\"\nHowever, over time, similar incidents have occurred too many times, and Sayu now bears a grudge against tanuki.\nNowadays, if such a situation happens again, Sayu will pout in anger.\nSo, in order to get along well with Sayu, please memorize the following:\nSayu is not a tanuki, but Sayu.\nHer outfit is also not that of a tanuki's, but a mini mujina.",
            "Vision\tThis is the story of Sayu when she just started being on her own.\nFragile beings walking alone in this world inevitably find themselves in scary situations. The only way to understand what it's like is to have experienced it.\nThis is exactly what happened to Sayu. Adept at observation and evasion, she has always understood that she is not suitable for combat.\nHer overly petite stature gives her no advantage in terms of strength to speak of, and her ninjutsu will not be of much use in actual combat.\nYet missions do not wait for ninjas to grow fully before descending upon them. In an era of turmoil, Sayu would also find herself in trouble because of not-so-important work.\nSurrounded by strong foes, she had to do her best and barely managed to escape. It cost her almost everything to bring the information back safely.\nExhausted and wounded, Sayu was about to faint, but only one thing lingered in her mind:\n\"It's not only strong brute force that can overpower everything, the weak have their own way of surviving. It's because you're weak that you can notice those unseen moments that change your fate... The chances of escaping from here are slim, but that's what my ninjutsu is for.\"\nThe moment the leaves fell, she disappeared. All her pursuers were incredulous. The tiny ninja disappeared as if she were dust in the wind.\nThe next morning, Sayu struggled to get up, and found that the ninja pack strapped to her leg had long since disappeared.\nHowever, a surprising object appeared in the same place instead — a Vision gleaming in the sunrise.\nNow, with the power of the Vision, Sayu can wield a claymore taller than herself. She no longer has to fear the omnipresent strife of a chaotic world.\nUnfortunately, Sayu's most immediate worries have not yet been resolved.\nRegarding her growing taller, it seems that even a Vision is unable to do anything about it."

I simply get rid of them to prevent them from disturbing my master's meditations.\"\n\"If some people did wind up getting caught in the crossfire and injured... Well, it was their decision to come here. There isn't much I can do about that.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tShenhe is in all likelihood the least accustomed to mortal life amongst those who take on an adeptal appearance.\nHaving been sequestered in the mountains since a young age, she lacks experience and common sense, which makes it difficult for her to relate to people normally.\nTo ordinary people, there are many solutions to any given problem. But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.\nFor example, she almost never considers \"negotiation\" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to \"threats\" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?\nShe has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.\nFor example: Why do we need to pay for food?\nIs there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?\nShe even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.\nIn a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.\nMuch like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.\nMountain Shaper once had this to say about her:\n\"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.\"\n\"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.\"\n\"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tLiyue has no lack of folktales about meetings with the adepti, and many of these concern relative nobodies whom an adeptus took under their wing, thus elevating them greatly.\nHowever, the circumstances under which Shenhe's fate became tied to the adeptal abodes was no such glorious thing. If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.\nWhen she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.\nOver time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.\nHe left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.\nAt last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.\nHer father had brought with him a secret art known as \"Fate Transference\"—\nBy making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.\nAt that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.\nHe claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...\nBut the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.\nHer father summoned that hideous, horrifying black \"seelie\" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.\nStupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.\nCrises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.\nThis creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!\nGripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark \"seelie,\" trembling yet resolute...\nSeveral days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.\nTaking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.\nIf not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.",

On impulse, she came down from the mountains one night to return to what was once her home.\nShe did not know how she felt about her home or her family. She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:\nTo live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.\nShe learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.\nHer childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers — and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.\nShe did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.\nShe simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.\nWas it hatred? Mania? Relief?\nThey were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant. It was as if her heart were an old well without ripples.\nNo, like a barren well with no water upon which there might be ripples.\nShe stood there for a long time, before departing again before the astonished eyes of all.\nEach step was slow indeed, but she never once turned back.",
            "Character Story 5\tLiyue has its own fortune-telling, destiny-reading methods, similar to astrology.\nOf these, there are two fates that people seek to avoid at all costs.\nOne is that of the \"solitary star,\" which dictates that one will be separated from friends and family, living alone all one's days.\nThe other is \"disastrous evil,\" which means that one will face many hardships and perils.\nWhen the adepti rescued Shenhe, Moon Carver did once read her fortune.\nThe signs showed that she was marked by both the \"solitary star\" and \"disastrous evil,\" and that she was also plagued by intense homicidal urges — she was thus a person of supremely ominous destiny, doomed to harm both herself and others.\nTo ensure that she could grow up safely and not harm any innocents, the adepti bound her soul using red ropes.\nThis binding had the effect of restraining both her evil fate and her violent tendencies, but also shackled many emotions that should have originally belonged to a human.\nFrom then on, she became more and more disaffected by trivial matters, and even things most might consider important were but dust to her.\nShe became ever less human, and ever more like a lovely yet cold statue.\nBut surprisingly, she felt something stir within her when she encountered that Traveler from a distant land:\nLong-dormant emotions, now strangers to her, came loose all at once from the depths of fate's tableau.\nPerhaps it really was as Moon Carver once said: that heaven might dictate fates, but destiny's tale is written by mortals. The tale of Shenhe and the mortal world had not yet ended...",
            "White Jade Comb\tOnce upon a time, Shenhe had a full head of black hair.\nWhen she was first brought to Mt. Hulao, she would not say a word. The only thing she proved willing to do was to climb the mountain and watch the sea of clouds.\nIt was well, however, that she would sleep when tired, drink the dew of the mountains when thirsty, and would chew on a few stalks of Qingxin when hungry.\nCloud Retainer took this all in, but did not disturb the girl, instead making this comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her.\nThe adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship.\nShenhe did exactly as the adeptus said without any hesitation. And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.\nOn the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.\nWhen the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained.\n...\nToday, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.\nThrough her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:\nThe first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret.",
            "Vision\tFew people know how the young girl in the cave, intended as a sacrifice by her own father, had been able to stand against the monster for days and nights on end by herself.\nThough Shenhe was born into an exorcist family, her maddened father had not taught her a single thing about exorcism.\nAnd like many at that innocent age, she was also wholly unused to facing life's perils alone.\nBut in that aphotic cave, bereft of parental protection — indeed, betrayed by kin — Shenhe underwent a metamorphosis.\nJust as Moon Carver's readings had shown, the sleeping calamitous fates, violent urges, and unyielding spirit within her burst their bonds all at once.\nThose things served as an unseen shield and invisible blade, arming the girl's frail form.\nThey gave her strength, gave her claws and fangs, allowing her to attack that wretched creature before her, to swear to tear it to shreds — to prove that she, and not it, was the cruelest evil that stalked the darkness.\nTheir life-and-death battle across the next few days was one without end. Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...\nAs the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.\nWith the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.\nThe vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.\nIn the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate. In the future, it would also lead her back to the mortal realm."

            "About Shikanoin Heizou: Keywords\tI've made it a habit of mine to remember everything I observe in the form of keywords. They're a big help to me when I'm trying to make deductions. Take this person for example: we've got \"cat hair on clean trousers,\" and \"scratch on the wrist.\" Looks like they have a soft spot for animals, but they can't get cats to reciprocate...

The two of us meeting each other is really the culmination of every choice and move we've made up to this point. So what I'm saying is... our destiny is something we choose.",
            "About the Vision\tOh? So there are rumors that I can overpower my Tenryou colleagues without even using my Vision? Hehe, well, let me set the record straight. One: Although I am technically a Doushin, I'm strictly a detective. My mind is my greatest tool, not my muscles. Two: It's not like my colleagues and I are getting into fights with each other all the time. And three... *sigh* Alright, seems like there's no fooling you. Just... never mind then, okay?",

So I interrupted the court just as they were about to declare the verdict.

Coldcase\" had been completely leveled... It is a pity, these days I no longer have the time to go back and look through old files. I'm forever being brought in to help out on the toughest cases, and I barely have a moment to catch my breath in between jobs... Well, what can you do. Once you're a detective of this caliber, the cases come to you.",
            "More About Shikanoin Heizou: V\tBy the time a detective is facing a criminal, they have in some sense already failed. Whatever you might do to establish the truth and identify the culprit, you'll never be able to undo the damage caused by the crime. That's why I want my reputation to spread. I want to be a famous detective that makes would-be criminals quake in their boots and quit while they're ahead! In other words, I want to nip crime in the bud. Well, now that you've heard my spiel, why don't you lend me a hand?",
            "Shikanoin Heizou's Hobbies\tWould you like to sit in on a court trial at the Tenryou Commission some time? It's like watching the truth slowly emerge as a collage of facts is pieced together... I can save you a really good seat, but we'll have to pretend like we don't know each other... You know, just pretend.",
            "Shikanoin Heizou's Troubles\tThere are always those people who resort to violence at the very last second, as if that'll somehow solve their problems. It's a real bummer. Victory for me is to see the look on the defendant's face as they finally confess to their crime in the face of my ironclad evidence and watertight deductions... The moment a detective has to use brute force, they've already lost.",

            "Least Favorite Food\tI cannot stand dinner at the Police Station. It's always the same regimented meals, and don't even get me started on the taste. When it comes to food, you can't enjoy it unless you get to pick exactly what you want, right? But nope, poor me has to make do with slipping out and grabbing a quick bite. *sigh*",

            "Character Details\tShikanoin Heizou is an extraordinary young detective.\nThough working at the Tenryou Commission, he is at odds with the usual impression of a public servant, who is expected to be \"stern,\" \"solemn\"... and \"solemn\" again.\nOn the outside, he appears more well-behaved and polite than any other new hires, but on the inside, he is actually thumbing his nose at all the official mumbo jumbo.\nUnlike his colleagues, he does not go to the Station to report for duty on a daily basis and rarely shows up for any routine patrols.\nIt can seem like ages since you last saw him, and you may finally chance upon him at some crime scene. Yet, judging by that ever-present grin, you can hardly tell if he is actually there working.\nFunnily enough, all his \"unorthodox behaviors as a public servant\" are somewhat acquiesced to.\nHis colleagues are more than willing to work with him and his boss seldom criticizes him for being this unfettered.\nEven his boss's boss inquires after him every now and then.\nAll this can be safely chalked up to his unrivaled prowess as a detective.\nWhenever the Tenryou Commission is tackling an unusually complicated case, be it a major one or a mysterious one, everyone regards Heizou as their last hope to crack the code.\nEven the head of the Police Station marvels at his extensive experience in solving cases, but Heizou himself has a different opinion about that.\n\"Experience is another name for people's past mistakes, and that's not my trump card.\"\n\"My trump card is something I was born with.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tJoining the Tenryou Commission is no easy task. Not only do you have to pass the ability test, but also a thorough background check.\nTherefore, candidates are usually required to declare some essential information, such as any valuable property.\nAccording to Yoriki Owada, who was in charge of the check at the time, when Heizou applied, he handed in nothing but a blank declaration form.\nIt was a bright and sunny morning. Sitting opposite Owada, Heizou was curiously exploring the place with his eyes. Owada, who had been around the block by then, spent a moment deciphering the blank form, then looked up and insinuated,\n\"I've met many brilliant young people. However, it's a shame that none of them made it to the Station in the end.\"\nHearing this, all of a sudden, that seemingly hyperactive young man stopped looking around, sat up straight, and looked Owada in the eye.\n\"Right. How about a young person like me?\"\nHis switching happened so fast that Yoriki Owada was suddenly stunned, feeling like prey in the sights of some hawk-eyed predator.\nOut of nowhere, a strange sensation came over him, as if at that moment, he was the one being scrutinized.\nHe said jokingly then, as though it would steady his nerves,\n\"The Tenryou Commission does not discriminate against the poor. But if you have literally nothing to declare, then we'll make sure we pay extra attention to your background.\"\nIt was followed by an unexpected silence. The one sitting opposite looked straight at him without saying a word, just as before.\nOwada wasn't feeling his best, his forehead slightly twitching. Maybe it was too hot. He made to wipe off the sweat with the back of his hand.\nHowever, there was no sweat on his forehead at all. Owada stared blankly at the dry back of his hand, not knowing if he should wipe again or put his hand down.\nThe young man burst out into laughter upon seeing this. His hearty laughter immediately relieved Owada from his overwhelmed state.\nHeizou just leaned on the table with his chin in one hand, pointing to his head with the other. He smiled at Owada and said,\n\"Other than my genius, I have nothing to declare.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tThe Tenryou Commission is in fact not where Heizou started his career as a detective.\nBefore all this happened, Heizou once owned an agency called \"Bantan Sango & Heizou Detective Agency.\"\nIt was what was to become Bantan Sango Detective Agency in Inazuma City now, which was actually co-founded by Heizou and Sango in the beginning.\nThe story of the two started with them striking an instant chord with each other, only to end with them regretfully parting ways.\nAfter the breakdown of their partnership, Heizou's name, naturally, was taken down from the old business.\nAs for the reason behind it all, it can probably all be summed up as \"they had different visions.\"\nSango believes that a detective's entire mission is to uncover the truth, which is something of utmost significance. Most detectives also hold this belief dear to their hearts.\nBut Heizou reckons there's more to it. That there might be something that's even more vital than the truth.\nYears of experience working as a detective have made him aware that when a new case comes to him, that means something unfortunate has already happened.\nNo matter how the criminals are punished for their evil conduct afterward, it cannot change the fact that someone has already been hurt.\nSimilarly, no matter how skilled a doctor is, they will never be able to treat a patient and pretend that nothing ever happened, telling them,\n\"Look, all your wounds have healed, as if you were never wounded in the first place.\"\nThe truth is from then on, whenever the patient sees a doctor, sees an infirmary, or sees the scars left by the operation, they will be reminded every time of all the wounds that were once on their body, hurting them.\nDoctors are helpless to prevent violent actions from being executed somewhere. Detectives cannot stop new cases from emerging. But Heizou hopes to break this status quo once and for all.\n\"If I can't nip evil in the bud, then I shall be its natural enemy.\"\n\"The name of Shikanoin Heizou will be renowned throughout the world and intimidate anyone with malicious intent all across Teyvat.\"\n\"They will realize one thing. Once they submit to the darkness, I will hunt them down to the ends of the earth.\"\nIt was at that point that he made his decision to leave the agency and join the Tenryou Commission.\nIt was the starting point for him to become the \"detective\" he seeks to be.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"I've read in the novels that every great detective has an assistant, just like every katsudon has a pork cutlet.\"\nAt the Police Station, the new recruit Uesugi approached Heizou with a big smile on his face.\n\"So, Heizou, what do you think? Can I be your assistant? I'm very clever.\"\nHeizou eyed this chirpy young man up with a grin, then rubbed his chin and replied,\n\"My intuition tells me that you are not that clever.\"\n\"Huh? May... maybe your intuition is wrong.\"\nThe sentence Uesugi just uttered seemed to have some magic to it as if it were a closing joke made at the end of a comedy. On hearing that, his nearby senior colleagues all laughed like a supportive audience.\nThe clever Uesugi immediately realized that he had said something inappropriate, so he tried to patch his statement up.\n\"What I meant is... we can't just rely solely on intuition in our line of work!\"\nUnexpectedly, everyone laughed even harder this time. Uesugi, not comprehending what had happened, thought to himself that maybe he should really consider being a comedian.\nAt that moment, Heizou brushed his shoulder as if to remove the awkwardness along with the dust.\n\"I was just joking. Actually, my intuition tells me that you, Uesugi, are going to be an excellent Doushin.\"\n\"And so, I suggest that you find your own assistant should you have the time.\"\nNo sooner had Heizou finished his sentence than he had run away like the wind, leaving a still-baffled Uesigi and his guffawing colleagues behind.\n...\n\"You've still got a long way to go before you can be Doushin Shikanoin's assistant.\"\n\"I was just trying to help since I noticed that he has no assistant...\"\n\"Of course he does. He mentioned his assistant many times.\"\n\"What?! Has he?\"\n\"Didn't you hear him say 'my intuition tells me' multiple times?\"\n\"Huh?! Are you saying... that his assistant is... his intuition?!\"\n\"Exactly! That guy can solve cases merely with his intuition. Isn't that wild?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen it comes to performance, Heizou should've been promoted many a time, considering all his achievements.\nHowever, in reality, Heizou has been a Doushin ever since he joined the Tenryou Commission.\nOn the other hand, many among his colleagues and superiors have risen through the ranks as a by-product of his achievements.\nAfter Heizou's cousin, Kano Nana, heard about it, she came to Heizou and was determined to stand up for him.\n\"You may be a brat, but this unfair treatment you've suffered is way worse.\"\n\"I'm going to give those goons a piece of my mind!\"\nHeizou knew his cousin very well, so to save her from any trouble, Heizou patiently explained the reasons behind this situation — a rare thing for him.\n\"Cuz, don't consider me lesser than them.\"\n\"Wanna take a guess at how many inmates at the Police Station Jail can name the Yoriki?\"\nHeizou spread his fingers of one hand, palm facing her. \"This number at most.\"\nHaving no idea what he was getting at, Kano Nana replied hesitantly, \"Five?\"\n\"What about the ones who can name this genius detective right in front of you?\"\nHeizou spread his fingers of the other hand, this time palm facing himself, \"This many at least.\"\n\"Five again? What's the difference?\"\nHeizou laughed, \"Cuz, I'm talking about the number of hairs on my hands!\"\n\"Just like we have no hair on our palms, none of the inmates can name all the Yoriki.\"\n\"But the inmates who can name me are as many as the hairs on the back of my hand!\"\n\"Now that my influence has far exceeded that of those Yoriki, what's in it for me to get promoted?\"\n\"On the contrary, staying close to the front line means that more criminals will be intimidated by the name of Shikanoin Heizou — that's my ultimate goal.\"\n\"So don't worry about me, cuz. I have never strayed, and I will never stray from my path!\"",
            "Character Story 5\tJust as Heizou claims, the most well-known name at the Police Station Jail is not that of any Yoriki, or even that of the General of the Tenryou Commission... But is instead the name of Doushin Shikanoin Heizou.\nHere, at least, even the name of the Raiden Shogun herself might be lesser in stature compared to his.\nAfter all, none of these criminals, great or small, have ever been personally nabbed by the Shogun, but a great many of them are surely here on Heizou's account.\nThis is how things panned out:\nIt started with some arrogant crooks boasting while temporarily out from behind bars of how elite their criminal skills were and how they had sent government officials off on wild goose chases, seeking to gain the admiration of their fellows.\nBut when asked why they were caught in spite of their great skills, they would often blame, through clenched teeth, the matter on \"that detective.\"\n\"Not that I didn't try, mind you, but he's just too cunning!\"\nThus did the detective's name spread throughout the prison.\nEven later on, the situation would again change when the criminals discovered that the detective who caught them was someone named \"Shikanoin Heizou.\"\nIt was one thing if a single detective could catch some skilled crooks. Perhaps he was just a good detective.\nBut if countless high-level criminals were seized by this one man, then surely he could not be an ordinary person.\nIn that moment, everyone present imagined something similar.\nA trickster god in the guise of humanity, scheming and cunning beyond compare, seeing into the hearts of mortals with contemptuous ease.\nWhy, a change of sides would see such a fellow become the greatest criminal in history!\nThose who were unwilling to take part in further affray spoke no more, while even the most hardened and wicked amongst them secretly thought:\n\"It might be best not to take him on, or to speak more ill about him than we should.\"\nEven the fiercest criminal lords no longer use his name even when they wish to boast, instead using the pseudonym \"Cyclone.\"\nWhen the Doushin on guard duty heard this new title, they would ask what it meant.\nAnd some petty criminals would reply, \"A calamity! A plague upon all us crooks!\"",
            "Martial Arts Tournament Champion's Medal\tThe way Heizou sees it, detectives are to destroy their opponents' defenses using their intelligence.\nUsing force to subdue criminals is, inevitably, the inferior way of doing things, and so Heizou does his best to avoid this in his daily work.\nAs such, his reputation at the Police Station was, for the longest time, one of a brainy but dainty character.\nThus, everyone was all too sure that he would be in for a tough time at the internal martial arts contest held by the Station.\nThis would be a no-holds-barred contest: neither limitations on schools nor restrictions of weapons would hold any sway here. The only rule was that the one to knock their opponent from a fifty-pace ring would triumph.\nTo everyone's shock, however, the \"brainy\" Heizou would show up to this contest without using Vision, and he carried no weapon but his two bare fists, which in turn carried him to the final.\nDuring that match, Kujou Sara, who had arrived upon hearing rumors of his prowess, assessed that the match was over even before it began.\n\"Doushin Shikanoin moves lightly and his fists are the match of any weapon. It would be hard to match him in melee — and only a skilled bowman would triumph.\"\nAs she predicted, Heizou's opponent would concede defeat after taking seventeen punches to the left side, with only a streak of Heizou's hair sliced off to show for it.\nBut just as he was about to be crowned champion, Kujou Sara herself walked into the ring and picked up a training bow, requesting a match with Heizou.\nThere was a brief uproar. Most of the people participating in the tournament were rather junior Doushin, and no one had expected that General Kujou herself would attend.\nHeizou narrowed his eyes. He had originally only come to test his skills, such that he might not be found wanting in the extreme situations where his wits alone would not be sufficient.\nBut at this moment, his blood was up and the spirit of competition had descended on him like it often does on youths, and so he gladly accepted. In a flash, the atmosphere heated up and everyone was flushed with excitement.\n\"Great going, Heizou!\" Doushin Uesugi yelled from the stands, Yoriki Owada quietly pumping a fist from beside him.\nAfter a moment's preparation, both parties entered the ring. The rules were slightly different this time: neither of them would use their Visions. This would only be a contest at fifty paces between Sara's arrow and Heizou's fists. Whoever touched the other first with their weapon would be declared the victor.\nThe atmosphere by now was practically bursting at the seams. The battle was about to begin. Yet few realized that in a battle between experts, each move was peril itself, and that the match would be ended in a single shot.\nSara let fly, and fifty paces away, Heizou was seen with his right hand clenched in front of his chest, tightly gripping an arrow that quivered but two finger-widths from his heart like a striking serpent.\n\"It's my loss. What a frighteningly fast shot,\" Heizou said with a laugh, before throwing the arrow aside. \"There was no time to evade, General, so I was forced to touch your weapon.\"\n\"I won by dint of the rules alone. I have met very few who could catch one of my arrows barehanded. I doubt the result would be so certain, were this a real battle.\"\nSara's eyes glimmered as she spoke such praise.\n\"Doushin Shikanoin, you are skilled in both mind and hand. You will do great things, should you be more disciplined.\"\n...\nHalf a month later, a champion's medal specially made by the Tenryou Commission arrived at the Grand Narukami Shrine, along with a handwritten note.\n\"Here's a little something, cuz, for you to give to my old man when you've got the time. Y'know, just to let him know that I haven't completely made a mess of his teachings and all.\"",
            "Vision\tHeizou mentions his childhood very little, for it was not a happy one.\nHe was born in a remote village where his ancestry was rather prominent and his father was a martial artist of some small repute.\nBut just like every other rebellious child in the world, he only wished to escape having to take up his father's work, even as he was forced to learn martial arts alongside him.\nThis state of affairs would persist until Heizou made a friend who claimed to be from a wealthy merchant family at a festival.\nThis friend was a bright and agile mind, and would often bring all manner of new gadgets for Heizou to play with, saying that they were from his family's storehouse.\nBooks from Sumeru, mysterious toys from Fontaine of all sorts... These toys injected significant vibrance into Heizou's otherwise monotonous life.\nThe friends grew closer as they grew older, but Heizou also began to notice a problem.\nHis friend's clothes were always filthy, hardly the sort of image a rich merchant's son should have.\nHe thus decided to have an honest talk with his friend. They would have a conversation like proper adults.\nUnexpectedly, his friend immediately admitted to having deceived him, and even confessed that all the gifts he had given Heizou were stolen from the local merchant's guild.\nHe even went so far as to relate that he had originally met Heizou at the festival with the intention to steal some valuables from the latter, only for them to have become friends instead.\nHe laughed as he confessed these matters, as if this was some interesting tale.\nHeizou was furious, though he knew not what he was angry at: was he angry at having been deceived by his best friend? Or was it because his best friend was a criminal?\nRegardless, he reprimanded his friend harshly: \"We're not friends anymore!\"\nFuming, he returned home, sought out each and every item he had been given, and threw them all out, till nothing but a single green pebble remained.\nThis was one of a pair of \"treasures\" the two of them had fished out from a small stream, and each of them had taken one. This item alone was not tainted by theft, and was perhaps purer even than their friendship.\nGazing upon it, Heizou hardened his heart and threw it out the window... only for it to strike the window lattice and come flying back, rolling under his bed.\nNow irate, and seeing how even the heavens were conspiring against him in this endeavor, Heizou, in a fit of growing pique, dumped himself on the ground like a frog with a punctured belly, refusing to move.\nLooking at the ceiling despondently, he told himself that he would one day put these ill things out of his mind. Yet the world is such that the more we wish to forget things, the more they shall refuse to be forgotten.\nA year later, when the festival where he and his friend first met rolled back around, Heizou happened to rediscover the pebble, and had it on him as he traveled to attend the festival.\nHe knew not what he was expecting, but fate already had an answer on hand... though it was not the one Heizou expected.\nHeizou would meet his friend again that day, collapsed by the roadside in a pool of his own blood amidst the screams of the crowd.\nJust a moment earlier, his friend had gotten into an altercation with a ruffian who had angled to steal his Mora purse, and who then in a panic had plunged a dagger into his heart.\nHeizou dashed over to check on his old friend, the pebble in his hand falling by the wayside. Catching sight of it, his friend's dull eyes lit up just a little.\n\"Come here to see me, did you... Heizou?\"\nHeizou tried to keep pressure over his good friend's chest, but the blood kept seeping through his fingers, and he was again filled with fury, even more so than the year prior.\n\"Just shut up! Shut up!\" He yelled at his friend.\nHis friend shook his head, and with great effort opened his purse. There was not a single Mora inside — nothing but the green pebble that had belonged to him.\nSqueezing the last ounce of his strength out, he held the pebble out to Heizou with a smile broader than when they had parted.\n\"I... I came to see you, too...\"\n...\nHeizou did not recall how he had returned home. His mind was blank, filled with nothing but rage and disgust.\nBut in that moment, his intuition told him that he felt rage and disgust at a certain thing, and that he and it had always been foes.\nThis thing had mixed deception into friendship, and it had caused life to be cut short before its time. \"Sin.\" That was its name.\nBut it was not his friend's sin of deception or theft, nor was it the murder that the thief committed. It was something more abstract, something of a higher order.\nIt was the culmination of all the sins in this world, hovering over all like a titanic shadow covering the skies, fixing its cold and unfeeling gaze on all that was good in this world, and seeking ways to snuff it out.\nOne morning, one month later, Heizou sneaked out of doors to travel afar, leaving a farewell note behind. He had found his enemy, and he would now embark on a journey to make war against it.\nAccompanying him on this journey was a green stone, but it was not the pebble that symbolized friendship, but instead a Vision that stood for his resolve."

            "Character Details\tSucrose may be the assistant of the genius alchemist Albedo, but they could not be more different in research direction.\nAs opposed to studying the essence of alchemy and the ability to create new life, she is far more interested in using alchemy to modify existing life, all the better to add variety and color to this world.\nDespite her youth, she has already achieved some brilliant results. For example, she has been able to increase the nectar output of Sweet Flowers by 70% by irrigating them with a special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows Sunsettias to maintain their freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch.\nEven people who were initially suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field of alchemy after seeing such results.\nHowever, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more ambitious than this.\nIt's a secret, and is also her little dream.",
            "Character Story 1\tBio-alchemy explores numerous lines of inquiry, all of which stem from Sucrose's questions about living things in the world. These questions, in turn, are born out of her insatiable curiosity, a faculty that is far more developed in her than it is in most.\nFor instance, Sucrose's curiosity was once drawn to the sweet flower, accepted by most people as simply being a source of sugar.\nShe wondered: Although sweetness is clearly the most readily identifiable feature of this plant, should that be grounds for limiting its application as we have tended to do? Does it not merit further study?\nSo, after a careful study of the various features of sweet flowers, she devised thirty-something distinct rearing plans along with numerous control groups to account for temperature and other environmental conditions.\nAnd yet, her experiment still underestimated just how many variations were possible. After the experiment began, Sucrose found herself with more questions rather than fewer, and the novel discoveries that her experiment yielded gave her inspiration for further research.\nSucrose is incapable of leaving a question unattended to — it makes her restless, even guilty, to ignore it. Spurred on by this quirk of her temperament, her rearing plans grew in number to almost three hundred.\nThe result was a whole new series of sweet flower strains: Some with thrice the number of flowers, some with heads five or six times the normal size that could even float in the wind, and some even producing a sweet-tasting fruit.\nMonths of experimentation later, Sucrose had finally answered every last one of her questions pertaining to sweet flowers. As she finished writing up her research notes, she let out a long sigh of relief.\nThough she was physically and mentally exhausted, the sight of stack after stack of her bio-alchemical research volumes stretching around three walls of the room gave her a deep sense of joy and satisfaction.",
            "Character Story 2\tTo the people around her, Sucrose comes across as a quiet, introverted alchemist with little interest in the lives of others.\nIn fact, the truth is quite the opposite: Sucrose is fascinated by absolutely everything that exists in the world. The only thing is, she finds the discipline of social interaction to be far more difficult to master than that of alchemy.\nIn alchemy, the process of trial-and-error coupled with a determination to get to the truth is sufficient to bring you to your answer eventually. But with interpersonal relationships, there is the added complication of having to factor in manners, moods, and other unquantifiable variables. To make things worse, there seems to be no room for an approach that relies heavily on making errors.\nHence, Sucrose decided to avoid such variables at all costs and stick to her familiar methods in satisfying her curiosity.\nFor instance, Sucrose had always been curious about whether she and Cat's Tail bartender Diona, both of whom have animal ears, had any shared ancestry.\nIn fact, this was not a private matter, and most people would simply ask the question. But Sucrose was concerned that it would be a sensitive topic — she, for one, did not like people drawing attention to her ears.\nSo, she resorted to the method she knew best: observation.\nFor one whole month, Diona constantly had an unnerving sense that someone was secretly watching her. She assumed that one of the tavern patrons was stalking her, and was none too happy about it.\n\"Similar genome, but ultimately different ancestry. Cat connection merits further study. Note: Unable to obtain bone sample thus far.\"\nThis is the conclusion that Sucrose has jotted down in her notebook based on her findings so far.\nBio-alchemy aside, Sucrose made one further discovery from this episode.\nThat is to say, judging by the pair of cat-ear spectacles she made for herself after the event, it would appear that she has finally come to comprehend a certain uniquely feline variety of cuteness. She is too shy to wear them in public, however, and only puts them on when alone in her room.",
            "Character Story 3\tOnce every three days, Sucrose ventures out into the real world at dusk. To her, these excursions are rare and momentous events.\nOne by one, she visits the butcher's, the Adventurers' Guild, and the Springvale hunters, looking for a material of a very specific kind.\n\"H—Hi... Sorry, I... I'd like, um, the freshest, best-quality b—bones you've got... Yep, the ones with the blood and meat still on.\"\nPeople found her behavior utterly unusual at first, but once they had gotten used to it, they were eager to oblige, even putting the rarest bones aside for her in advance.\nThis was a major bonus for her. Not only was she able to acquire an ample supply of the usual chicken and boar bones, but she also got her hands on a complete lizard skeleton and even a chunk of hilichurl leg bone still bearing fresh blood.\nHer eyes would light up with excitement at the sight of these strange and rare bones. She would thank Katheryne of the Adventurers' Guild profusely, bowing to her over and over.\nAs well as going some way towards satisfying Sucrose's curiosity, she also found new inspiration from piecing new bones together\nMore importantly, collecting skeletons was her hobby, and she was crazy about it.\nOne day, Sucrose happened to overhear a mother attempting to discipline her child:\n\"If you don't do as your told, the scary old lady with the cloth sack over her back will come to your door, go into your room, pick out every bone from your body, and take them away!\"\nSucrose's curiosity compelled her to investigate further. It turned out that this was nothing more than a ghost story used by mothers to shock their children into compliance, and that it had existed long before Sucrose was even born.\nShe breathed a sigh of relief when she found out the truth.\nSoon after this, people noticed that Sucrose had switched her cloth sack for a leather one. Perhaps she did this just because she was shy. Or perhaps it was to avoid arousing suspicion...",
            "Character Story 4\tAs an assistant, Sucrose does everything she can to support Albedo, and even though his alchemical inquiries tend more towards the abstruse, she finds herself learning a lot every time.\nAfter an experiment lasting five straight days and nights came to its end, Albedo noticed that Sucrose was on the brink of collapsing from exhaustion, and organized a mandatory seven-day vacation for her.\nSucrose began her holiday determined to take a proper rest and regain her energy, but from the moment that she woke up on day one she struggled to adjust to the vacation lifestyle.\nFirst things first, let's get some breakfast: fried eggs, sausages, and a cup of coffee. Nothing new to report there. All of these were foods and beverages that she had previously researched, after all.\nNext, she thought, how about a little rest and relaxation in the sun with a good book? Again, nothing new to report: plenty of research shows this to be one of the most effective means of relaxation. There wasn't a book that she hadn't already read, and there wasn't a query that she hadn't already highlighted, looked into, and later annotated for clarification.\nSo then she did some household chores: laundry, dusting, tidying. Check. Once again — nothing new to report. There was nothing to dispute about the fact that a clean and tidy environment is conducive to mental well-being.\nHalf a day in, and Sucrose had not had the occasion to ask \"why\" or \"how\" even once.\nShe was bored, restless, and angsty, and she could not calm herself down.\nShe was desperate to throw herself at a research problem. It didn't matter what it was: She would have happily researched the potted plants on the terrace, even if nothing came of it. Anything just to pass the time.\nBut wherever she looked — the Lamp Grass to her left, the Sweet Flower in front of her, or the Cecilia to her right — all she found were things that she had previously researched in exhaustive detail.\nFinally, she gave up and forced herself to go to sleep. The next day, she reported to the laboratory first thing in the morning.\n\"All day long, you have nothing to research, and nothing to question. That's not rest, it's torture!\"",
            "Character Story 5\tSucrose's childhood was no different from anyone else's in Mondstadt. She had loving parents, she had her best friends. Life was simple, and beautiful.\nHer most enduring childhood memory is a story she once heard about a wonderful paradise.\nSomewhere in a far-flung corner of Teyvat, there was an undiscovered domain with pretty pink flowers the height of a hundred people, teeny-tiny floating fairies flying over all the place, and beautiful unicorns, the pinnacle of perfection.\nSucrose and her two best friends believed that if only they could reach this magical place, they would surely live happily ever after.\nBut time went by, and one of her friends left on a long journey with her adventurer parents, never to return.\nThe other suffered a domestic tragedy: Her father fell ill and passed away, her whole personality changed, and she broke off her friendship with Sucrose. The promise that they had once made to reunite some day in the future no longer meant anything.\nSucrose felt lonelier then than she ever had felt before in her whole life. They hadn't even set eyes on paradise yet, and already her friends were gone...\nWell. Even if they were destined to never meet again, Sucrose was desperate to honor their past friendship in some way. That was when she discovered the existence of alchemy from a book that she was reading.\nSucrose realized: Though she had never had the chance to find the entrance to that wondrous place, she now had the opportunity to be the creator of her own paradise.\nThus began her study of bio-alchemy, and she poured all of her curiosity and passion into it.\nStill, she has never once mentioned the story of paradise and her bygone friendships to anyone else.\nPerhaps one day, when that place she first learned of in a children's storybook finally becomes a reality in the real world, her friends will return.",
            "Mist Flower Project 3, Version 17, Enlargement Trial\tSucrose has a set of strict requirements when it comes to the selection of species for her personal paradise. After experimentation, specimens that are up to standard she tags with \"pass.\"\nAt first, she wanted to give exotic-sounding names to each of her plants, just like in the stories, but whenever she came to try and name something, she found herself completely at a loss for ideas.\nAfter spending so long as a scientist, she insisted on flawless logic even when it came to relatively trivial matters such as naming.\nHer earliest batch of names included the following: \"Grassflower,\" a flower that grows on grass;\n\"Flowergrass,\" a grass that grows beneath flowers;\n\"Multigrassflower,\" a flower that grows on dense grass, and so on and so forth.\nEven such un-paradisiacal names as these would take Sucrose forever to come up with — far longer than the duration of the experiments themselves.\nIn the end, she gave up on naming altogether and simply used the specimen identifiers from her research notes instead. Yes, this meant the names ended up being much longer, but, but...\n...But anyway, Sucrose is the creator of this paradise, so why shouldn't she get to name things any way she wants to?",
            "Vision\tIt was on an afternoon just like any other that Sucrose received her Vision.\nReady to begin her one-hundred-and-fifty-ninth dandelion-seed simmering experiment, she poured her carefully crafted alchemical solution into the cauldron.\nInstantly, the cauldron hit boiling point, and the entire room was filled with steam. Sucrose rushed to the cauldron, anxious to see what new transmutation had occurred this time; in her excitement, she even burned both of her hands on the lip of the cauldron.\nMuch to her disappointment, however, the Dandelion Seeds had once again burned to a crisp. But there was something new there, too: lying there amidst the black Dandelion Seeds was a Vision.\nAnd yet, rather than pouring out the liquid and taking her Vision, she first thought for a moment and then lit the fire up again to continue simmering the contents of the cauldron.\nShe was curious to know what further reactions might occur between Dandelion Seeds and Visions.\nSadly, the experiment ended in failure after three hours of constant simmering.\nStill, there was no denying that she had reaped a great reward from this experiment, for the elemental energy provided by her Vision would become her single greatest asset in her future bio-alchemical endeavors."

            "Character Story 1\tAs the youngest Harbinger in the history of the Fatui, Childe is hardly bound by convention, and plays by his own rules accordingly.\nThough this lone wolf is not so well-received by his peers and is also at odds with their methods, his cavalier demeanor hides a responsible, watertight meticulousness.\nHe is a proud man of his word. Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it.\nBe it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...\nHe not only keeps his promises, but does so with finesse and surgical precision.

He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes before sitting beside them and tending to their fishing lines.\nThis was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.\nBut whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.\nThese were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.\nSo he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.\nEven after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as \"Childe\" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.\nNo longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train — to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.\nSuch long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance.",

There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...\nOr perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.\nThis darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.\nIn those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.\nNo one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.\nWhen his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.\nThus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.\nThis would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior.",
            "Character Story 5\tBy the time he returned home, the young man was no longer the same.\nHe was no longer frightened and hesitant but had become frivolous and confident. He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.\nConflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.\nIn the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much uncalled-for havoc to the seaside village of Morepesok.\nOr perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow — and he reveled in it.\nUltimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.\nHe hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.\nThis was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of Pulcinella, the 5th Harbinger.\nShocked by Ajax's great strength and curious about how he invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the Tsaritsa.\nHis insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...\nUntil at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of \"Childe\" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.\nBut becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey.",
            "Tartaglia's Letters to Home\t\"Dearest Sister, are you all keeping well at home? Has the old man's headache gotten any better?\nPlease send my regards to our parents and our siblings.\nI've sent some wind chill medication over from Liyue Harbor. It's very effective, and will probably keep him from nagging for a while. It should reach you after a few days.\nApart from our father's affairs, I naturally haven't forgotten about gifts for you all.\nThis letter should come with two kites from Liyue, a rattle drum, two porcelain dolls from Inazuma, and a crate full of various snacks.\nAnd please break it to Anthon that the residents of Liyue are just boring old ordinary humans, like us.\nThey're not made of stone, and they don't even eat stones.\nDo not fret for my sake, Tonia, and refrain from making trouble for anyone at home. I will be home soon. When I have seized the seven stars of Liyue and laid them at the feet of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, I will take the first ship home, just as I promised — and you know how I always keep my promises.\nYours faithfully, Your loyal knight.\"",
            "Delusion\tTartaglia's Delusion is his old badge of honor and the proof of his strength.\nHe still remembers with perfect clarity the day when he received his Delusion and ascended to become a member of the Harbingers.\nAs he stood before the cold, stern Tsaritsa, The Jester, the very first of the Fatui, personally pinned this insignia onto him.\nIt was his reward for slaying many terrible beasts, and a memento of countless battles.\nBut it was not this that brought Tartaglia joy, for honor is the natural reward of the warrior.\nNor did he pay any mind to the odd looks his new \"colleagues\" gave him, for the opinions and bellyaches of others meant nothing to him.\nThe sight of the Tsaritsa on her lofty throne alone stirred the young man's heart with respect and admiration, not merely because she opened the way for him to find an abundance of looming battles, but also because of the way she looked upon him.\nHer gaze was cold but pure, arrogant yet sharp.\nShe was not only the sacrosanct Cryo Archon but also a true warrior.\nThus did Childe, having received his Delusion, swear an oath of fealty to the one and only Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya."

Yes, she almost took my Vision away, but ultimately that's just because of her unique perspective. Everyone has their own perspective, there's nothing strange about that.\nThe only thing I don't understand is her goal in doing so. What does she imagine eternity really looks like for Inazuma?

In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her — sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little.",

            "About Sayu\tAh Sayu, stubborn Sayu. I've asked her countless times to teach me ninjutsu, but she always refuses. She even goes out of her way to avoid me now... I'm just a student looking for a teacher, am I really that out of line?",
            "About Kujou Sara\tThe Tenryou Commission General... Mm... Make sure to be extra careful if you have any dealings with her. She has a lot of power in her hands, and she's not very open to persuasion. Smiling and batting your eyelids certainly won't get you anywhere with her.",

            "About Eula\tYou've had a run-in with Eula Lawrence before, huh? All I know is that their whole family are about the worst-tempered people you could ever meet. You're better off steering clear of them if you can help it. Ah, now I'm in a Mondstadt mood again... The memories.",

            "More About Thoma: III\tI get homesick once in a while, too, so I completely relate to all the international merchants on Ritou. I try to look out for them as much as I can. The difference between us is that they see themselves as just passing by, and have no intention of trying to integrate here. And because that's how they think, it becomes their reality. The majority of Inazumans will never see them as anything more than outsiders.",
            "More About Thoma: IV\tFor some of the more conservatively minded people in Inazuma, the idea of an outlander working as a retainer for one of the Commissions is unthinkable. So there was a time when I was not that welcome here. I'm pretty sure I'd have been deported a long time ago without a couple of Kamisatos fighting my corner. I couldn't let the clan down after they'd been so kind to me, so I put in a lot of honest work, and eventually, everyone was finally able to accept me.",
            "More About Thoma: V\tI'm not sure if I should get into this, but... Ah, hopefully you won't mind. I went through a period where I really just wanted to go home — Mondstadt is my homeland, after all. But I was torn... It wouldn't be easy to leave Inazuma behind, either. I mean, just look how good the people here have been to me. The Kamisato Clan always has a room for me, and there are people I've met here that are like family. So, I went back and forth over it, and ultimately decided I'd stay in Inazuma. When I'm missing Mondstadt... I can just chat with you. You don't mind my rambling, do you?",

The only problem is that for the last two days, I haven't been able to buy crab anywhere! So, what, am I gonna have to dive into the ocean and grab them myself?",
            "Favorite Food\tWithout a doubt, my favorite food is Rice Cake Soup. I like cooking up a big, delicious potful for everyone to share. It's a recipe for a good time.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tAs far as food is concerned, I'm fine with anything. If we're counting beverages, though... I'm not very good with alcohol. Don't laugh, and before you say it — yes, I've wondered what this says about my identity as a Mondstadter. But, y'know... too much alcohol is bad for you, anyway. So not drinking is a good thing.",

            "Receiving a Gift: II\tUm, are you free right now? Would you mind sharing some of your cooking tips with me?",
            "Receiving a Gift: III\tI don't think I've ever tasted anything like this... Oh, it's not too bad, though.",
            "Birthday\tQuick, come with me! I remembered it's your birthday, obviously, so I thought I'd throw you a proper party. There's food, there's drinks, and I invited a whole bunch of your friends, too. Hey, this is your birthday we're talking about! I wasn't about to let you spend it all alone!",

He is able to get everything done well, and even Furuta, the butler of the Kamisato Clan, is full of praise for his housekeeping skills.\nHowever, most of the time, Thoma does not stay in the Yashiro Commission, but goes elsewhere to deal with some special matters discreetly.\nFor example: solving the problems encountered by the Yashiro Commission, asking for information for the head of the Kamisato Clan, fulfilling Ayaka's wishes, etc.\nIn those unknown corners, Thoma has always used his own way to develop the influence of the Yashiro Commission.",
            "Character Story 1\tThoma seems to have been born with a good temper.\nRegardless of whether he's dealing with a dignitary or a street vendor, Thoma can easily find an opening to join the conversation and have a good time with them.\nThoma, who is good at socializing, has a wide range of contacts in Inazuma. When he first arrived in Inazuma, he relied on his insight and communication skills to make friends with people in various industries. Later, many people would take the initiative to get to know Thoma.\nThe more people you know, the more resources you can get. Thoma would learn a lot of first-hand information from them, or quietly strike \"deals\" that are beneficial to the Yashiro Commission.\nHowever, although Thoma has a vast network of contacts, he has never used it for personal gain, nor has he ever forced others to do things in the name of the Yashiro Commission.\nSociability, precise judgment, and just the right amount of tact. Perhaps this is the reason why Thoma can thrive as a \"fixer\" in Inazuma.",
            "Character Story 2\tSurprisingly, the handsome and cheerful Thoma has no resistance when it comes to cute animals.\nWhen Thoma's out, he always carries some small snacks for animals, and feeds stray cats and dogs when he sees them.\nIt never fails to make him smile seeing animals scarf food down.\nTo Thoma, these animals, like himself, are part of what makes up the world.\nEven if they don't seem to be eye-catching, they are still trying to live.\nAs long as you live, good things will always happen... This is what Thoma has always believed in.\nEven if these animals had not encountered good things before, he hoped that at least his presence would be a good thing worth celebrating for.",
            "Character Story 3\tAs the housekeeper of the Kamisato Clan, Thoma is an \"all-rounder\" when it comes to housekeeping.\nWhether it's cleaning, cooking, sewing, gardening, caregiving, or socializing, he can handle it all with ease.\nFor Thoma, housekeeping is not only a job and duty, but also his hobby.\nHe would clean the house like new, making sure that there was not a single grain of dust left on the railings. He would be in a very happy mood when faced with a clean and tidy Yashiro Commission.\nPerhaps it's the sense of accomplishment that comes with cleaning. Whenever he has the chance, Thoma will pick up a broom or duster and sweep away any unsightly stains.\nIn addition, he also takes special care of the daily lives of his colleagues around him.\nThere was a winter when Inazuma's temperature suddenly dipped, and a guard of the Yashiro Commission accidentally caught a cold while out on patrol. A few days later, he unexpectedly received a sweater hand-knitted by Thoma.\nThe sweater that was just the right size made the guard think back to the clothes he received from his mother every winter. Now that his mother was old, she hadn't sent him clothes for many years.\nWith this in mind, the guard took a long leave of absence to visit his family. The day he came back, he brought Thoma a special souvenir from his hometown, and they became good friends.",
            "Character Story 4\tThoma's father is an Inazuman and his mother is a Mondstadter.\nThoma grew up in Mondstadt and has been accustomed to its carefree and happy atmosphere since he was young. Influenced by this, he can easily mingle with anyone.\nHowever, he has also been taught by his father since he was a child and places great importance on the word \"loyalty\".\nAfter Thoma's father returned to Inazuma, he was worried that his old man would not be able to drink Mondstadt's wine there, so he sailed to Inazuma alone in a boat carrying Dandelion Wine.\nOn the way, a huge wave overturned the boat and Thoma fell into the water. Fortunately, he just drifted unconscious down the water until he got washed ashore on a beach in Inazuma.\nAt that time, Thoma had nothing and no family with him, but still started his life in Inazuma with optimism.\nHowever, despite his best efforts, he was unable to find his father, who was supposed to be in Inazuma.\nBut at his most difficult moment, Thoma met someone in Inazuma who was worthy of his \"loyalty\" to the end.",
            "Character Story 5\tDue to his hailing from Mondstadt, Thoma is often regarded as an \"outsider\" by the local residents of Inazuma.\nDespite the strange looks and gossip directed towards him, Thoma never showed any dissatisfaction, and always smiled at all doubts.\nThoma is recognized as the most amiable person in the Yashiro Commission, but to outsiders, it is another story.\n\"Don't offend Thoma! Otherwise, things will be difficult to handle.\"\nNo one is sure when it started, but this saying has gone around so much that many people are convinced of this when they hear it.\nAs for those who have had unpleasant run-ins with Thoma, the mention of him still instills fear:\n\"Don't be fooled by that guy! He's always smiling kindly, but all I did was cheat the Yashiro Commission out of a small sum of money, and he...\"\nThat's right, if anyone dares to harm the interests of the Yashiro Commission or disrespect the Kamisato siblings, Thoma will make them pay.\nHe sees this as his duty and does his best, but does not like to boast about his achievements. Even if he is criticized for this, he will not defend himself too much.\n\"Gee, who cares about such trivialities? And it doesn't matter what kind of person I am, as long as those who should know know it.\"",
            "Old Duster\tThoma's favorite duster has been with him in many \"conquests\".\nAs it has been used for too long, no matter how Thoma cleans and takes care of it now, it still looks old and gray. Despite this, Thoma is still reluctant to discard it.\nThis duster was given to Thoma when he was first assigned cleaning duties at Yashiro Commission. As soon as he sees it, he recalls those hard but happy times.\nAt that time, Thoma had yet to comprehend various cleaning techniques. Due to his lack of experience, he was often busy doing all kinds of cleaning and tidying work until late at night.\nAccompanying him were the moonlight above his head, the chirping of insects in the summer night, and the sound of a duster tapping on the beams.\nThere are many different kinds of cleaning. From a simple cleaning to an all-out deep cleaning, Thoma has experienced it all.\nAt first, he found the work boring, but after he got used to it, he found that he could think more quietly when cleaning.\nSo to this day, Thoma often uses this duster to perform his work.\nWhile brushing away the dust in front of him, he also brushed away the fog in his head in a quiet and steady state of mind.",
            "Vision\tIn his early years living in Mondstadt, Thoma did not have particularly strong aspirations.\nEach day, he was awakened by the early morning sun and the fresh fragrance of flowers. After breakfast, he could choose to take a relaxing stroll through the city or explore the wilderness freely.\nAt that time, Thoma thought that people should have the happiness of living a leisurely life. Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.\nThis calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.\nHere, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of \"repayment\" arose.\nTen years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.\nKamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:\n\"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase. You are someone who can see what's at stake, so if you don't want to get involved, leave early.\"\nCould Thoma, who had received so many favors from the Kamisato Clan, just leave like that? Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.\nThe storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.\nBut after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:\n\"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady.

            "Character Details\tThose who travel through Avidya Forest will sometimes meet a rather special Forest Watcher.\nHe has large ears, a long tail, and a slightly delicate face. If a less discerning eye were to appraise him, he might even look like some kind of small, rare animal native to the forests.\nBut anyone who has ever been acquainted with him will know that there is clarity to his words and steadiness in his bearing.\n\"One moment, please. Judging from your equipment, you're a traveling merchant bound for Sumeru City, aren't you? Come back, please, you're going the wrong way.\"\n\"I mean, just look over there. The leaves are dense and the air grows damper. That doesn't seem like the main road leading to the city, no matter how you slice it.\"\n\"Oh dear, your waterskin is empty, isn't it?\"\n\"Come, let me share some with you. Being in a rainforest is no reason to skimp on your water supply.\"\n\"If you drink any old water you find out here, you might next find yourself at Bimarstan, you know?\"\n\"Of course, if that is part of your itinerary, then I suppose you have... interesting opinions.\"\nAmidst the flurry of instructions, the lost lamb will have all the arrangements made for them before they know it.\n\"Um... Thank you so much! Still, uh, might I ask who you are...?\"\nAs the other Forest Rangers look upon the traveling merchant bowing to the diminutive Forest Watcher, they cannot help but laugh.\n\"Pfft-haha! Ahem. This is our G— Well, Forest Watcher Tighnari.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tOther than the most basic of forest maintenance, the Forest Rangers will often encounter a great number of problems whose origins lie in human hands:\nArbitrarily occupied camps, shacks built by the destruction of vegetation, domestic waste dumps that may become sources of pollution, bonfire embers that have yet to fully be extinguished...\nIn response to such situations, they must not only solve the problem at hand but also try to admonish the perpetrators, and yet these exhortations are not always accurately communicated.\nThis would improve greatly after Tighnari joined the Forest Watchers.\nPart of this is his scholarly rigor — the way in which he will unceremoniously \"teach\" the troublemakers.\nBut more importantly, Tighnari is able to communicate the correct way to act and the reasons behind that in a manner most comprehensible to those he teaches.\nThe way he sees it, these crafts of living out in the wilds are also knowledge, and getting people to accept knowledge is an art in and of itself.\nIt is far more useful to be straightforward about the other part's errors and what is at stake as opposed to dryly giving advice.\nThis is also why Tighnari has disagreements with the Akademiya's purveying of the Akasha Terminal.\nKnowledge is, in truth, the treasure of all living things. It should be passionately embraced by those who are curious about it as opposed to becoming a tool for survival, doled out in limited amounts.\nUnfortunately, as a young researcher, Tighnari did not have anywhere near the clout to stand against the Akademiya, and even now he can only do what he can in a limited capacity.\nAt the same time, reality does not quite match up to one's ideals—\nAs such, some unlucky soul getting lectured by Tighnari is no uncommon sight in Avidya Forest.",
            "Character Story 2\tWhen Tighnari first arrived at Gandharva Ville, he was still a normal member of the Forest Rangers, no different from any other Forest Watcher.\n\"Rather than taking part in all these babbling debates about all these 'big ideas,' I might as well change the forest for the better in a practical manner, using what I’ve learned.\"\n—This was how Tighnari originally felt when he first joined the Forest Rangers, a fresh graduate from the Amurta school who had parted ways with the Akademiya.\nBut he soon discovered that the Forest Rangers had significant problems of their own.\nThey were passionate about protecting the forest, yes, but the organization as a whole lacked rational structure and instruction with any measure of scientific rigor.\nAlas, change could never come without any difficulty, and yet Tighnari was never good at leaving things to rot.\nAs such, the highly active Tighnari leapt into action to turn things around.\nHe created a rationalized forest patrol log, assigned tasks according to each person’s strengths, and regularly conducted natural history training for his fellow team members...\nWith the enthusiastic cooperation of his fellow rangers, the forest patrols around Avidya Forest grew ever more effective, especially around Gandharva Ville, where it could be said to be perfect.\nNaturally, this knowledgeable and highly active researcher would become someone whom the Forest Rangers looked up to.\nOne day, Tighnari would discover that he had a new name amongst his colleagues.\n\"Hey there, General Watchleader! Could you look over the journal entry I wrote for today?\"\n\"General Watchleader! I’ve found some baggage down in the Chinvat Ravine. I've placed at the lost and found section.\"\n\"Oh no, where has Sag gone... Um, General Watchleader, have you seen it around?\"\nHe at first took this for slips of the tongue, but many recurrences later, this sign would see his brows burrow.\n\"Do we actually have that rank? Or are we going for something similar to 'General Mahamatra'?\"\nWhatever the case, Tighnari would eventually prevail upon everyone to go back to calling him \"Forest Watcher,\" \"Master,\" or \"Mr. Tighnari.\"\n\"I'm afraid 'General Watchleader' is too great a title for me to bear,\" or so he said.\n\"Heh, that actually reminded me of a joke someone once told about the title of 'General Mahamatra'...\"\nHe did not make mention of this other reason for his refusal of that title.",
            "Character Story 3\tThere was a time when a certain vibrantly-colored flower was all the rage amongst the people of Sumeru. Many people would buy it to adorn their houses, and thus it gradually became a trend.\nUnfortunately, this flower was not long for the world if removed from the rainforest, and would only last two days at best if so plucked.\nFlowers that were no longer fresh would soon be discarded, left by the wayside to rot — a shame by any standard of imagination.\nThis could not go on. Never mind the garbage or pollution-related issues, this trend ran the risk of damaging the forest ecosystem if it persisted long enough.\nHowever, just as the Forest Rangers were mulling over this problem, Tighnari would send out an offer of cooperation with the flower sellers in the city:\nThe Forest Rangers would help them gather fresh flowers for free, but that they should provide an additional service, informing those who came to purchase the flowers that if they sent them back by the second day, they would obtain a receipt that could then be exchanged within the next 3 days for a dried flower decoration.\nThese decorations were of course provided by Tighnari and the Forest Rangers. The option to pay for them and how much to pay would be left up to the buyer of the flowers, just as things might go at a charity bazaar.\nPart of this Mora would go to the store owner as service charge for collecting the leftover flowers, and the rest would be used for funding the Forest Rangers' efforts to maintain the rainforest.\nThis cooperation went quite smoothly indeed. The flower shop owners saved themselves the trouble of searching deep within the rainforest for their floral quarry and got some extra income; the Forest Rangers got to control the process and amount of flowers gathered, and also got some extra funds; those who bought flowers would not only receive a temporary flower as a companion, but also a more permanent memento.\nThis all went quite swimmingly, but some rangers did not understand, asking: \"Why didn't we just ban the gathering of such flowers in the first place? Wouldn't that have been simpler?\"\nTighnari shook his head when he heard this answer, causing his ears to shake.\n\"We shouldn't make such simple calculations. If we were to force our requests through, we would be just like a stolid lecturer who fails to have others understand, but who stirs up feelings of rebellion instead.\"\n\"If that were to happen, our reputation would be the least of our woes — we would have our hands full trying to deal with those who were coming to pick flowers illegally!\"\n\"In any case, trends will change. Don't worry. I'm sure the people's attention will shift to something else soon.\"\nPragmatic as these words were, they quickly found traction with the Forest Rangers. Collei's nods were particularly rapid.\n\"The dried flower decorations that Master taught us to make have been pretty popular with the children, too!\"",
            "Character Story 4\tBeings of Tighnari's race are a rare and unpredictable sort, and usually give off the impression of being loners.\nBut Tighnari's circumstances appear to have been somewhat different.\nAlthough he has spent much time meditating on his research and has spent comparatively little on cultivating relationships, he did wind up stumbling into a good number of comrades nonetheless.\nTighnari had excellent grades in the Akademiya early on, and many would come to him for help with their coursework. When his seminar courses would end, he would often go along with requests for group photos.\nNot that he really understood them, but he agreed anyway.\nThat was how \"Tighnari knows everything, and he's so nice to talk to!\" became a widespread saying, causing many to fight for his time. Even students from other Darshans would want to collaborate with him.\nThis went on till one day, when his popularity also attracted the attention of the General Mahamatra Cyno—\nForming factions and gathering forces... these were nothing if not the harbingers of academic corruption!\nYet with some time spent observing Tighnari, Cyno found that the former had only received people out of the goodness of his heart.\nTighnari himself only really had eyes for his work, and was dispassionate concerning the offers of others.\nCertainly he would agree to collaborate, but only in the interests of furthering his research in the best way possible.\nUltimately, Cyno's judgment was as such: \"This is an upright and reliable talent who has no questionable dealings. Threat resolved.\"\nIt was perhaps due to this pure impression that the General Mahamatra, known for distancing himself from scholarship and scholars alike, would let down his guard and become friends with Tighnari in the days to come.\nThese factors would all culminate in yet another meeting with another comrade.\n\"This young lady's name is Collei?\"\n\"It's okay if you can't read or write. We all start having no knowledge — in this you are no different from anyone else.\"\n\"Shall we start with writing your name, then?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tAll who love research share the enjoyment of performing that research and a curiosity for the unknown.\nThis is also true of Tighnari, and indeed, his curiosity seems to have been with him since birth.\nWhile children his age were still reading fairy tales, Tighnari was already flipping through crates and shelves in his parents' study.\nFrom his father, who studied insects, he would take general textbooks, and from his paleontologist mother, he would borrow some images of fossils.\nThus did Tighnari absorb all this knowledge, whether he understood it or not, while hugging his tail.\nSlowly, however, he found that as his knowledge increased, the unknowns that he wished to explore also grew more numerous.\nFor example, why were other people born without ears and tails like that of his family?\nFlipping through all the ancient tomes he could find in his home, Tighnari discovered a manuscript left behind by an ancestor of his that concerned \"Valuka Shuna.\"\nAs the records claimed, Valuka Shuna were a race subject to King Deshret, and who dwelled in the vast desert, mostly possessing light-colored fur and large ears that were excellent at dissipating heat.\nLater, calamity would descend and destroy King Deshret's realm, with the Valuka Shuna only surviving due to the grace of the Dendro Archon, which turned their fur green.\n\"It is worth noting that while Valuka Shuna were noted to have been more like foxes, the meaning of their name was 'large desert dog.'\"\n\"According to a human friend of mine who has a very close relationship with the forest, it was a little creature known as an Aranara that gave them this name.\"\n\"Oh my,\" Young Tighnari thought in shock, \"so I'm a 'large desert dog!'\"\nTo be more precise, it was the fact that his ancestors had lived alongside the Valuka Shuna that they did end up inheriting some of their traits.\nBut of course, such technicalities were of no importance to an excited child. Thus did Tighnari immediately ask his father to bring him — the 'large desert dog' — back to the desert to have a look on his next surveying trip.\nUnfortunately, they met with an accident. Not a few meters into the desert, Tighnari fell into a faint from the heat and had to be rushed back to the rainforest.\n\"Oh no,\" Tighnari thought sadly as he convalesced in his treehouse, \"the 'large desert dogs' have devolved in my generation.\"\nMany years later, the ignorant child had become a reliable researcher, and this event had become a joke consigned to the past.\nNowadays, Tighnari not only knows why those little Aranara gave them this name, but also why he faints easily from the desert heat.\nThe former is simple. Foxes and dogs are, biologically speaking, both canines, so the Aranara might have viewed them as interchangeable.\nAs for the latter, though Tighnari is loath to admit it, it probably had something to do with what his father said then as he tousled his hair.\n\"This lad's fur is an intensely dark shade of green. He's going to have trouble in the desert heat for sure!\"",
            "Researcher's First Magnifying Glass\tWhen little Tighnari would explore alone in the rainforest, he would carry a magnifying glass with him.\nThat was a gift from his mother. Light and cogent in design, it could immediately be recognized as a tool suited for children.\n\"Your ears can already help you hear sounds from reeeaaally far away, so let this magnifying glass help you see smaller things!\"\nThus did Tighnari use this device to see the veins on the back of leaves, the powder that hung off butterfly wings, and the trails of the rainforest snakes...\nIt was through this gradual observation, collection, and consideration that he was eventually admitted into Amurta early, beginning his official learning journey under the Sage there.\nTighnari placed the magnifying glass, scarred and weathered by many years of use, on top of his brand new invitation letter, placed his hands on his cheeks, and thought for a good long while.\nFinally, he had this constant companion of his converted into an ornament that he might wear on his person.\nHe knew that once he entered the Akademiya, he would study more complex books and access more marvelous instruments, and that there was little place for this old beginner's magnifying glass.\nHowever, it would always be his companion in his search for knowledge, and would follow him to see lands wider and vaster still.",
            "Vision\tAcademic conferences are unavoidable at the Akademiya, no matter whether one is here to learn or work.\nThose at the podium will wax lyrical, and those in the audience will give their support. This sight is most commonplace at such conferences.\nBut strictly speaking, what researcher, adrift amidst the vast sea of information, will not make mistakes in their investigations?\nAt one such conference that Tighnari attended, one speaker spoke of things that Tighnari knew to be untrue.\nThen, he was just a bystander and a listener. Glancing around his surroundings almost subconsciously, he noticed that neither his classmates nor his teachers had said anything.\nWhat should he do? Perhaps everyone indeed knew what the problem was, but did not want to make the speaker lose face.\nOr perhaps he was the only one who had noticed the problem, and his silence now would cause misinformation to spread...\nBut Tighnari did not hesitate long before steeling himself.\nThough both his status and the scene were obstacles in his path, the rigor of knowledge eventually won out.\nAfter all, knowledge was like a star blazing through the night sky. Nothing would divert its path.\nSo thinking, Tighnari raised his hand—\n\"My apologies. If I may interject—\"\nThe researcher onstage was at first a bit shocked to hear his gentle voice, but reacted swiftly and invited him to elaborate.\nAs it turned out, Tighnari had done the right thing.\nThe speaker, after having processed enough of the information, accepted his corrections earnestly.\nAnd once their exchange had ended, other students and teachers in attendance would also speak in their turn, leading to new research angles opening up for the topics discussed at the conference. Tighnari himself would also receive namecards from some well-known researchers.\nOnce the whole incident was over, Tighnari would heave a sigh of relief.\nThat was a fortunate... No, indeed, a joyous thing that those who studied alongside him also accorded knowledge the gravitas it deserved.\nBut he had not yet counted on something still more fortunate and joyous to occur.\nWhen the meeting ended and Tighnari stood to leave, he heard a crisp, clear \"clink!\"\n—Lo and behold, a Vision rolled off his garments onto the chair below."

            "About the Windmills\tPaimon: Mondstadt has so many windmills, doesn't it?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, the city is built above water, so it probably relies on the windmills to draw the water upwards.\nPaimon: That's correct! The winds blow through Mondstadt all year, so this supply of water is very stable.\nPaimon: Also, the windmills are what they call \"visible winds\" — and wind chimes are called the \"audible winds.\"\nPaimon: Paimon guesses they can be thought of as mascots and prayers to the Anemo Archon for protection.\n{NICKNAME}: Ah, mascots. So, like you then, Paimon?\nPaimon: No! Not at all! They're made of wood, and you can't eat them in an emergency either, 'cause all you'll do is grind your teeth down!\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh...\n{NICKNAME}: ...I don't know what to say to that.",
            "About the Tavern Owner\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that if you give tavern owners a considerable tip, they'll be willing to give some information on the down low.\nPaimon: You mean the Angel's Share? But Master Diluc seems like a very rich man.\nPaimon: How big a tip is \"considerable,\" anyway?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... Maybe I might have heard wrong.\n{NICKNAME}: Or maybe I might have heard this rumor in another world...\nPaimon: You sure have been to many worlds, haven't you?",
            "About Cider Lake\tPaimon: Cider Lake never freezes, no matter what time of year it is.\nPaimon: The best apple ciders in Mondstadt can only be made using the fresh water from this lake.\nPaimon: It really does taste great! Paimon could drink two big bottles in a second!\n{NICKNAME}: Wow.\nPaimon: Tee-hee!\n{NICKNAME}: With your size, I can't believe that you can drink that much liquid...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And not explode like an Anemo Slime.\nPaimon: Paimon has a special stomach just for tasty drinks!\n{NICKNAME}: A special stomach? ...I have so many questions about how this world works.",
            "About the Library's Restricted Section\t{NICKNAME}: About those books in the \"restricted section\" that Lisa mentioned...\n{NICKNAME}: Have you ever wondered what sort of books might be kept in there?\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps...\n{NICKNAME}: ...It contains books not suitable for children?\nPaimon: Huh? But \"The Boar Princess\" isn't in the restricted section!\nPaimon: What could be more unsuitable for children than that? ...Hmm, Paimon's curious...",
            "About Effort and Reward\tPaimon: Paimon finds that hard work hardly works here in Mondstadt.\n{NICKNAME}: Why do you say that?\nPaimon: Just look at Huffman from the Knights of Favonius. He does his best at his duties every day...\nPaimon: But the ever-relaxed Captain Kaeya is his boss.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, but isn't Jean, who works the hardest, the Acting Grand Master?\nPaimon: W—Well, how about this, then...\nPaimon: Venti's the god of Mondstadt, and he's the laziest of them all!",
            "About the Goth Grand Hotel\t{NICKNAME}: Sure would be nice to spend a night at the Goth Grand Hotel...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks so too!\nPaimon: The rooms are sure to be big and clean.\n{NICKNAME}: Still, I've heard Mr. Goth say that they've had all kinds of strange problems ever since the Fatui moved in.\n{NICKNAME}: The Electro Cicins that their mages brought in attracted a lot of dust with static electricity, which ended up killing a lot of those Cicins.\n{NICKNAME}: Then, someone mixed up the Mist Grass Pollen and the pepper...\n{NICKNAME}: And the Agents ended up brawling amongst themselves, each insisting that the other owed them money for wine.\nPaimon: ...Hang in there, Goth Grand Hotel...",
            "About the Way the Wind Blows\t{NICKNAME}: Everyone says that Mondstadt is the land of the wind.\n{NICKNAME}: But I wonder which direction the seasonal winds come from.\nPaimon: Why don't we ask Venti?\n{NICKNAME}: He'll probably just dodge the question with a \"hehe\" or something...\nPaimon: True. The Anemo Archon is just a Tone-Deaf Bard. What does he know about the wind?",
            "About Alchemy\t{NICKNAME}: So here in Mondstadt, alchemy is practiced out on the streets?\nPaimon: Is that so strange?\n{NICKNAME}: In many of the worlds I've been to in the past, alchemy has always been a secretive art.\n{NICKNAME}: Watching alchemy being practiced as a part of daily life is like being in a world where people have three stomachs...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks only having one stomach is weird!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh...\n{NICKNAME}: Are you serious?\nPaimon: What do you think?",
            "About Teyvat\t{NICKNAME}: Teyvat's day and night both seem particularly short.\n{NICKNAME}: The skies here are full of stars, but they aren't the same as the ones seen from my home.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder if the fates of people from Teyvat are also related to their constellations.\nPaimon: Oh? Do you know how to read the stars, too? That's amazing! Not a lot of people outside Sumeru can do it.\nPaimon: Paimon's curious! Come on, do a reading for me, quick!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm...\n{NICKNAME}: The night sky pictured on Paimon's cape... flows with the light of many stars, and also of the deep ocean...\n{NICKNAME}: The movement of these stars... tells me that... in, say, seven days from now...\nPaimon: ...In seven days what?\n{NICKNAME}: Something good, or something bad, might occur...\nPaimon: Heh, right... your theory sounds as rock solid as a Geo Slime... And about as brainy, too.",
            "About the God of Freedom\t{NICKNAME}: On the way back to Mondstadt after rescuing Dvalin...\n{NICKNAME}: We finally got to see one of the Seven Archons, didn't we? It was interesting to see what kind of god he was.\nPaimon: Hmm... Haven't we known Venti for quite a while now?\n{NICKNAME}: As Venti, yes... But still, this was the first time that we got to see him as the Anemo Archon, Barbatos.\n{NICKNAME}: Normally, he hides his true divinity behind the facade of a bard.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What does freedom really mean, when demanded of you by a god?\"\n{NICKNAME}: That question that he asked Dvalin... I'm still contemplating that, you know?",
            "About Mondstadt's Terrain\tPaimon: Mondstadt is full of wide plains and rolling hills.\nPaimon: People say that when Barbatos made this land, he used the storm to flatten the cliffs and valleys...\n{NICKNAME}: Still, it looks like he missed a few spots.\nPaimon: Like Starsnatch Cliff?\n{NICKNAME}: Exactly.\n{NICKNAME}: On the map, it almost looks as if it was meant to be the apex of a vertical structure, but ended up at the wrong orientation.\nPaimon: Wh—What's an \"apex\"?",
            "About Couplets\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that couplets are a traditional art form in Liyue. If you can write a line that works as a second half to one that someone else has written, you'll be well paid!\nPaimon: But linking the couplet is hard, so it's not easy money.\nPaimon: Not only does the rhythm need to match, but the meaning has to as well.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Care to give an example?\nPaimon: Uh... \"Windrise's winds never churn.\"\n{NICKNAME}: ...Um, \"But the Sea of Clouds' clouds always return.\"\nPaimon: Huh... Not bad!\nPaimon: Let's not waste time here. We've got some money to make!",
            "About \"Don't Play With Food, or With Money\"\tPaimon: There's a saying of Rex Lapis' that's commonly used here in Liyue. Paimon thinks its rough meaning is... \"Don't play with your money.\"\nPaimon: It's because the first Mora were minted from his golden form and given to humans in trust.\n{NICKNAME}: Heh, Kaeya sure seems to enjoy playing with his money...\nPaimon: And that's why you shouldn't learn from him.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, as a child, I was taught not to play with my food.\nPaimon: Yup, yup. You've got to respect your food.\nPaimon: ...Wh—What are you looking at Paimon for?",
            "About Heart's Desire\tPaimon: Walk in seven clockwise circles, then walk in seven anticlockwise circles, then open your eyes...\n{NICKNAME}: Are you sleepwalking?\nPaimon: Nope! Paimon is just trying to see if that antique shop from \"Heart's Desire\" actually exists!\n{NICKNAME}: Well, assuming that a shop in a story does exist, what would you like to buy, Paimon?\nPaimon: A Slime Creator!\n{NICKNAME}: Does such a thing even exist?",
            "About the Guhua Clan\t{NICKNAME}: Lately, some Guhua Clan disciples have been retelling an ancient story.\nPaimon: The Guhua Clan, huh? Paimon bets it's a heroic story!\n{NICKNAME}: Several male disciples decided to partake of a contest of arms to see who would marry their female junior, and she approved.\nPaimon: Ooh, Paimon's heard this one. In Liyue, they call this \"a joust for a spouse\"!\n{NICKNAME}: But the night before the contest, she stole the eldest disciple's favorite sword.\nPaimon: Ah, so she wanted him to lose... Poor guy...\n{NICKNAME}: I know, right? Forced to use a sword he wasn't used to, the eldest disciple suffered a crushing defeat.\n{NICKNAME}: Unable to accept this result, he fell to his knees and wept.\nPaimon: Oh no... He must have really loved her, right?\n{NICKNAME}: In the end, he was forced to... marry her in front of everyone.\nPaimon: Wait... so the loser had to marry her!?",
            "About Dihua Marsh\tPaimon: Did you know the reeds in Dihua Marsh are common materials used in making paper?\nPaimon: The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes. It's all very sophisticated.\nPaimon: Over the years, many heroes and swordsmen have also chosen Dihua Marsh as the location of their duels.\nPaimon: The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep...\nPaimon: So there are a lot of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...\n{NICKNAME}: And what's my takeaway from all of this supposed to be?\nPaimon: Don't get into a fight in Dihua Marsh!",
            "About the Gentleman Bird\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that in Liyue, people call the crane the \"gentleman bird.\"\n{NICKNAME}: And do you know why that is?\nPaimon: Hmm... Paimon's not quite sure...\n{NICKNAME}: Well then, let me tell you the story of the lucky crane repaying its debts.\n{NICKNAME}: A long, long time ago, there was a kind-hearted scholar who saved a lucky crane that had fallen into a trap.\n{NICKNAME}: Later, on a cold winter's night, a beautiful maiden came to his door, asking to lodge with him.\n{NICKNAME}: The maiden shouldered a greatsword on her back, and taught all that she knew of swordsmanship to the scholar, supervising him as he studied day and night.\nPaimon: Whoa...\n{NICKNAME}: Once he had finished his training, he went out into the wilds with the maiden to do good and fight for justice.\n{NICKNAME}: Ten years later, the lucky crane took the form of a gentleman, and finally came to return the favor, but discovered the couple had already lived out a fortuitous life...\n{NICKNAME}: And that is the story known as \"The Gentleman's 10-Year Debt.\"\nPaimon: Ahh...",
            "About Jueyun Karst\t{NICKNAME}: Rumor has it that Jueyun Karst is the abode of the adepti.\nPaimon: Wow — the abode of the adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps we'll meet the adepti on those cloud-piercing mountain peaks.\nPaimon: Wow — meeting adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: But I wonder, how would one normally communicate with the adepti?\nPaimon: Wow — communicating with adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm. My emergency rations seem to be going bad. Best to consume them quickly...\nPaimon: Ahem. Well... Paimon thinks that shouting from the mountaintop should work.\n{NICKNAME}: That seems more like a way of getting the attention of a hilichurl, rather than an adeptus.",
            "About the God of Contracts\t{NICKNAME}: To think that the Geo Archon had signed a contract with the Cryo Archon.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder what the contents of their agreement were...\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't care who you are, making a deal with the Tsaritsa is super dangerous!\n{NICKNAME}: Be that as it may...\n{NICKNAME}: Since Morax is the god who understands the basis of contracts the best...\n{NICKNAME}: He's definitely given this some thought.\nPaimon: Well that's true. Morax himself called it the \"contract to end all contracts\"...\n{NICKNAME}: I trust that we will witness the truth, and its denouement, play out...",
            "About Divine Predictions in Liyue\tPaimon: Come to think of it, while Rex Lapis enjoys visiting his people in private, he only descends officially once every year.\nPaimon: None of the other gods do this. Hmm... Does Rex Lapis have any deeper intentions?\n{NICKNAME}: I have my guesses...\n{NICKNAME}: You see, those annual divine predictions have already captured the hearts of the people of Liyue too much.\n{NICKNAME}: Round and around they analyze and scrutinize every single word, finding limitless \"hidden meanings\" within them...\n{NICKNAME}: What do you think would happen to Liyue if such predictions were available every day?\nPaimon: Ah!\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now. Paimon would be offering Rex Lapis' favorite snacks to him every day!\nPaimon: If you could just get Mora straight from Morax's hands, who would ever need to do a day of honest work?\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... you made... some logical leaps, but that's basically how it is.",
            "About Benny's Adventure Team\tPaimon: If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared.\nPaimon: Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double- and triple-check your supplies in advance.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of 463 different ways of dying in these domains...\nPaimon: If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Why am I the only one dying here?\nPaimon: Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid 322 causes of death just by floating!\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains...",
            "About Bennett\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that Albert, being the leader of Barbara's fan club...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Sometimes gets bumps and bruises on purpose so he can go to the Cathedral to see her.\nPaimon: Paimon feels the Knights of Favonius should keep a closer watch on weirdos like that.\n{NICKNAME}: But it seems that a month later, Albert discovered that Bennett was managing to see Barbara far more than he was.\n{NICKNAME}: Well... Bennett does have the natural advantage when it comes to getting injured, after all.\nPaimon: What is this, a \"let's bother Barbara\" contest?",
            "About the \"Idol\"\tPaimon: Barbara's really popular, isn't she?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, she is the idol of the people of Mondstadt.\nPaimon: Come to think of it... Paimon doesn't really know what an \"idol\" is.\n{NICKNAME}: It's an occupation in which one's work is to be cute, be well-loved, and earn a boat-load of Mora.\nPaimon: Isn't that the same thing as being a mascot?\n{NICKNAME}: That's... heh, one way to put it.",
            "About Being Sisters\t{NICKNAME}: Lisa and Amber feel a bit like sisters.\nPaimon: Huh? Why's that?\n{NICKNAME}: Amber often runs errands for Lisa. Older siblings asking their younger siblings to do things for them so that they can slack off is a rather common practice...\n{NICKNAME}: But my sister and I are the same age, so we had to decide these things via rock-paper-scissors.\nPaimon: Whoa. So, doesn't that make you my younger brother?\n{NICKNAME}: What do you mean?\nPaimon: Well, since Paimon floats, you're the only one who can \"run\" any errands!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Seriously?",
            "About Kaeya's Eye Patch\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, have you ever seen what Kaeya looks like under that eye patch?\nPaimon: Nope.\n{NICKNAME}: So, it would seem he never takes it off...\nPaimon: Actually, Paimon already knows why!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh?\nPaimon: He must be hiding some big secret!\n{NICKNAME}: Really, a secret?\nPaimon: See, Kaeya heads out for assignments more than anyone else.\nPaimon: So the skin under that eye patch has to be way lighter than the rest of him.\n{NICKNAME}: So... if he ever takes that eye patch off...\nPaimon: He'll definitely become the butt of everyone's jokes. Maybe he'll even get a weird nickname!\nPaimon: Like, say, \"Pasty Eye\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Guess he didn't need to take it off to get a weird nickname...",
            "About Kaeya and Diluc\tPaimon: Strange...\n{NICKNAME}: What's wrong?\nPaimon: Diluc and Kaeya are really alike, so why don't they get along?\n{NICKNAME}: How are they alike, again?\nPaimon: Well, Kaeya's the kind of guy who acts shady in the light of day...\nPaimon: While Diluc is a shining beacon of justice in the dark of night!\nPaimon: Don't you think that's kinda the same thing...?\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I still don't see it.",
            "About Measuring Fighting Strength\t{NICKNAME}: If one hilichurl could beat, say, three wild boars...\n{NICKNAME}: Then how many hilichurls would it take to reach the fighting prowess of Master Jean and Master Diluc?\nPaimon: Not sure... but if you heard the way everyone talks in Mondstadt, you'd know that Master Jean is the strongest.\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I'd say that if Diluc strikes first, Master Jean wouldn't be able to counter.\nPaimon: Oh, she'd find a way.\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way.\nPaimon: Master Jean's Elemental Burst is really strong, you know~\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that \"field\" would also make Diluc stronger.\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't think Master Jean would even need her Vision to take on Master Diluc, because—\n{NICKNAME}: Diluc would only need a beginner's greatsword to—\nPaimon: Argh...\n{NICKNAME}: Ugh...\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* ...This is so dumb.\n{NICKNAME}: They both fight for Mondstadt, so they wouldn't come to blows.\nPaimon: That's why Paimon likes your idea of measuring their fighting strength in number of hilichurls.\nPaimon: ...Or in Paimon's case, in fifths of a wild boar.",
            "About Razor\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you know what a brush is, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Of course! Kinda like pens but with animal hair at one end for calligraphy, right?\nPaimon: That's correct! They say that finely-made brushes sell for high prices among Liyue's merchants!\n{NICKNAME}: So, would you like to make some too?\nPaimon: Uh-huh! But wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!\nPaimon: Razor's fur is all downy and soft. It'll definitely make great wolf-fur brushes! We could make lots of Mora like this!\n{NICKNAME}: Brushes made like that would conduct electricity. I'm not sure we could use them.\n{NICKNAME}: Besides, Razor isn't a wolf, nor are wolf-fur brushes made from actual wolves' fur...\nPaimon: Huh? Why are they called wolf-fur brushes, then?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?\nPaimon: Hmm. You have a point.",
            "About Klee\tPaimon: Klee's a really interesting kid.\nPaimon: All the Knights seem to like her a lot, too. You could even say they spoil her.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder who makes the better mascot: Paimon or Klee?\n{NICKNAME}: Oh wait, I forgot. Paimon's not a mascot, Paimon's emergency—\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon knows exactly what you're going to say. That joke stopped being funny a long time ago.",
            "About the \"Wondermaid\"\tPaimon: It's time for Paimon's Little Life Tips!\n{NICKNAME}: \"Little Life Tips\"?\nPaimon: In Mondstadt, if there's something you can't fix, or there's something you can't get clean no matter what you do...\nPaimon: If you ever run into something you can't handle yourself, you just need to shout this name into the skies:\nPaimon: \"Noeeeelle!\"\nPaimon: And everything that's troubling you will be swept away in an instant.\n{NICKNAME}: So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt... Pretty impressive...",
            "About Fischl\tPaimon: Fischl makes a very unique impression, doesn't she?\n{NICKNAME}: How so?\nPaimon: Well, she travels together with a talking raven, for starters.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm traveling with you. It's not all that different.\n{NICKNAME}: Still, Oz can also translate for Fischl. You, on the other hand...\nPaimon: What!? Paimon's way better than some bird!\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, how so?\nPaimon: Well, um... uh... at least Paimon doesn't need wings to fly!",
            "About Pets\t{NICKNAME}: Speaking of Fischl, she also claims to be a \"visitor from another world\"...\n{NICKNAME}: We're similar in that way. We even bring a pet along with us.\nPaimon: Pet? Now, wait just a minute, here...\n{NICKNAME}: But her raven, Oz... He looks cool, and is polite to boot.\n{NICKNAME}: More importantly, he can both scout and fight — very useful indeed.\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe I should make arrangements with Fischl to trade companions once in a while for, say, a week or two at a time. It should be quite interesting.\nPaimon: Hey! Doesn't Paimon get a say in this!?",
            "About Beidou\tPaimon: How do you become as popular and cool as Captain Beidou?\n{NICKNAME}: With enough experience...?\nPaimon: Paimon's already seen lots of things from adventuring together with you!\n{NICKNAME}: One also needs to experience trials and setbacks...\nPaimon: Paimon almost drowned that one time...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Maintain an inspirational disposition...\nPaimon: Uh-huh! Paimon's always rooted for you!\n{NICKNAME}: One must also have a... mature outlook towards problems.\nPaimon: Hey! Are you just trying to say that Paimon can't make it?",
            "About Ningguang\tPaimon: How does a person become as rich... no, as super rich as Lady Ningguang?\n{NICKNAME}: Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?\nPaimon: Well, there's the huge Jade Chamber, too! But isn't that also made of Mora?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you need an excellent mind...\nPaimon: Well... Paimon's really good at giving people nicknames!\n{NICKNAME}: You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets...\nPaimon: A serving of Fisherman's Toast goes for 1,025 Mora, and no discounts — even on rainy days.\n{NICKNAME}: You also need to be willing to work really hard...\nPaimon: Okay then... so, how do you make friends with a really rich person?\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, you're giving up already!?",
            "About Qiqi Being a Zombie\tPaimon: Umm... Do you think that Qiqi... needs to drink blood?\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... That's not a zombie, Paimon. That's a vampire.\nPaimon: Then, will she transform during a full moon?\n{NICKNAME}: Werewolves, Paimon. Not zombies.\nPaimon: Huh... As expected of a traveler, you really know a lot!\nPaimon: So, what special things can zombies do?\n{NICKNAME}: Exercises?\nPaimon: Ah, that makes a lot of sense! So, the ones that do exercises are zombies — got it!",
            "About Flying\tPaimon: Come on, {NICKNAME}, Paimon'll teach you how to fly!\nPaimon: Three, two, one!\n{NICKNAME}: Ah, Paimon's gone.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, whatever. I'm tired. Let's just sit here for a bit...\n{NICKNAME}: I'm flying with you in my heart... Mm...",
            "About Slimes\tPaimon: What sort of slime do you like the most, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Pyro Slimes, I suppose. You can feel their warmth just by getting close. That's something you'll need in the winter.\nPaimon: That's very practical, as expected of a traveler.\n{NICKNAME}: What about you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon likes them all! They're all very tasty!\n{NICKNAME}: Tasty? Hmm...\nPaimon: Turning slimes into bubbly, lovely, jubbly meals is the Paimon Special!\n{NICKNAME}: Well then...\n{NICKNAME}: I suppose that's one more thing I can eat before you become emergency rations, huh, Paimon?\nPaimon: Uhh... Paimon would rather not be on that list at all!",
            "About Hilichurls\t{NICKNAME}: Do you think that we're too harsh on the hilichurls?\nPaimon: Well... sometimes we really do seem like children who just can't resist kicking the hornet's nest...\n{NICKNAME}: I think we're doing more than just kicking it...",
            "About the Sleepers\t{NICKNAME}:  The \"Sleeper tribe\"... The hilichurls sure have interesting tribe names.\nPaimon: The Sleeper tribe will take any opportunity they can to take a nap.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that their animal-skin beds are really soft. Would you like to try them?\n{NICKNAME}: Not going to try it yourself, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon can sleep while floating! The air is the softest bed. Pretty sweet, huh?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Just a little.",
            "About the Meaties\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Meaty tribe\"...? Hahaha, these hilichurls pick the funniest names.\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Meaty tribe make regular sacrifices. The altars they build are really huge.\n{NICKNAME}: What do they pray for?\nPaimon: \"For meat to eat every day\"! It's an awesome wish, isn't it?\n{NICKNAME}: ...I suppose I should have expected that answer.",
            "About the Eclipse Tribe\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Eclipse tribe\"... So the hilichurls have normal-sounding tribe names like these, too.\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Eclipse tribe are really mysterious.\nPaimon: All the hilichurls of that tribe can draw an eclipse symbol.\nPaimon: But rumor has it that only the Dada Samachurl of the Eclipse tribe knows why the eclipse symbol is so revered within their tribe.\n{NICKNAME}: An eclipse symbol...\nPaimon: Hmm? Did you say something, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Ah... I was... asking you what sort of soup you'd like to have tonight.\nPaimon: Can't stop thinking about food, huh? Seems like you'd be more at home in the Meaty tribe than the Eclipse tribe. But anyway, Paimon wants boar soup. Thanks!",
            "About Riches\tPaimon: Paimon doesn't feel so good...\n{NICKNAME}: What's the matter?\nPaimon: Paimon hasn't opened a treasure chest in so long. If this keeps up... *whimpers*\n{NICKNAME}: If this keeps up, you'll one day get caught in a hunting trap with a single Mora as bait...\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon floats, so that'll never work.",
            "About Weight Gain\tPaimon: Wow, we've really had a lot of good food recently, haven't we?\nPaimon: You know what they say: \"Have food, will travel\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Won't you be unable to fly if you get fat?\nPaimon: Nope! Paimon never gets fat!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh...\nPaimon: So Paimon demands more food!\n{NICKNAME}: Ever eating but never growing... Don't you fail as emergency rations, then?\nPaimon: Yeah, yeah... Well it sure doesn't look like you have any other candidates... So you'll have to make do with Paimon!",

And what did the ocean say?\nPaimon: The ocean said... that it's time to eat, so let's go! Paimon wants some Fisherman's Toast!",

Uh, but Paimon doesn't wanna have to go get it...\n{NICKNAME}: Shall we decide with a game of rock-paper-scissors, then?\nPaimon: Ooh, okay!\n{NICKNAME}: Alright then. Rock, paper—\nPaimon: —Super Paimon Tornado!\n{NICKNAME}: ...What!?",

Any ideas on how to relax?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Sleeping?\nPaimon: Sleeping's boring.\n{NICKNAME}: ...Reading?\nPaimon: Paimon'll get dizzy.\n{NICKNAME}: ...Having a chat with some friends?\nPaimon: ...Ugh.\nPaimon: But those're all things that require thinking.\nPaimon: And not thinking is more relaxing.\n{NICKNAME}: And thus the \"Paimon Paradox,\" famed in the histories of philosophy in Teyvat, was put forth...",
            "About Dietary Differences\t{NICKNAME}: Liyue's cuisine is very different from that of Mondstadt.\n{NICKNAME}: For example, you can hardly find spicy fried dishes anywhere in Mondstadt.\nPaimon: That's why they say \"climate creates cuisine,\" ya know?\nPaimon: But wait... Why do all of Teyvat's slimes taste the same, then?\n{NICKNAME}: That's because you only know one way of cooking them...",
            "About Saving Money\tPaimon: Wow, a weasel thief's backpack can really hide a lot of Mora!\n{NICKNAME}: Well, it's because weasels, by nature, enjoy collecting shiny objects.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the origin of the weasel thieves has something to do with the Treasure Hoarders...\nPaimon: Also, aren't crows the type to collect shinies as well?\nPaimon: Paimon wonders if Oz has a secret stash of Mora that he collects behind Fischl's back.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, now that you mention it, Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder, do you—\nPaimon:—Uhh... Nope. Nothing here! You won't find any Mora in Paimon's shoes, no way!",
            "About Adventure Stories\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, have you ever read \"Vera's Melancholy\" before?\nPaimon: Well, it sure sounds familiar!\n{NICKNAME}: That book's pretty popular, and I've heard that the author made a tidy sum off of it...\nPaimon: *sigh* Paimon would love to make lots and lots of Mora...\nPaimon: Hmm... It's decided, then! Paimon will write an adventure story as well!\n{NICKNAME}: A tale of adventure, by Paimon?\nPaimon: Correct! It'll be a story in which the brave traveler defeats the dragon, saves the world...\nPaimon: And then sits down with his reliable companion for ten servings of Sticky Honey Roast!\n{NICKNAME}: Ten!?\nPaimon: Uh-huh! A happy ending attracts the readers, after all!\nPaimon: It's decided, then! We'll call it \"Paimon's Happiness!\"\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, what?",

            "About Seelie\t{NICKNAME}: Where do those treasure-chasing Seelie come from, I wonder?\nPaimon: Maybe they grow out of the ground — or maybe they fall from trees?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon doesn't know where they come from, but where there are Seelie, treasure's not far away!\n{NICKNAME}: Still... why do I feel a certain sadness every time they touch those treasures?\nPaimon: Hmm?\n{NICKNAME}: No, it's probably just my imagination.\nPaimon: Well... if you don't want the treasure, Paimon can hang onto it for you, free of charge!",
            "About Someone Unforgettable\tPaimon: Has anyone left a big impression on you during our recent travels?\nPaimon: For Paimon, that's Sara.\n{NICKNAME}: Timmie.\nPaimon: ...Huh?

            "About Paimon's Species\t{NICKNAME}: What monster made the deepest impression on you?\nPaimon: Monsters, huh? Probably... Ruin Guards.\n{NICKNAME}: Does a Ruin Guard really count as a monster? It's more like a machine...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that you can call anything that causes us trouble and needs to be defeated a \"monster.\"\nPaimon: Just like how we call anything that can be hunted \"prey.\"\n{NICKNAME}: Is that so... Well then, I think I'm finally able to classify you now, Paimon.\nPaimon: Eh? What do you mean?\n{NICKNAME}: You can be hooked and reeled in... therefore, you're a fish!\nPaimon: Hmph!",
            "About Storing Weapons\tPaimon: Hey, do that again! You know, that thing!\n{NICKNAME}: Which one?\nPaimon: The one where you make your weapon disappear with a swish, and then, fwoosh — you make it appear behind your back again!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, that? Haven't you seen that a ton already?\nPaimon: But Paimon hasn't figured out how you do it yet. Could you explain it?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, can you explain how you suddenly appear in front of me, and then disappear just as suddenly?\nPaimon: Uh... well... Paimon seems to have always been able to do this. But Paimon doesn't know how...\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. I believe that the art of putting my weapon away follows the same principle.\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe it's this similarity that makes us such good friends?",
            "About Chests\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, what do you think of treasure chests?\n{NICKNAME}: I believe that they were left behind by great travelers who once passed this way.\n{NICKNAME}: Every time I open one and look at its contents, I can feel a certain kinship with those who came before...\nPaimon: And that's how you get adventure experience!",
            "About Eyes\tPaimon: Look into Paimon's eyes!\n{NICKNAME}: Something the matter?\nPaimon: Kaeya said that people's eyes will betray them.\nPaimon: He can tell if someone is telling the truth or not just by looking into their eyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Huh...\nPaimon: Paimon loves Fisherman's Toast!\n{NICKNAME}: That should be the truth. Haha, well, that's also because you love everything that can be eaten.\nPaimon: Hehe.\n{NICKNAME}: Speaking of looking into people's eyes... I remember one gaze that left a particularly deep impression on me.\nPaimon: Whose gaze was that?\n{NICKNAME}: A Ruin Guard's. Really made me want to poke its eye out...",

Wait, WHAT!?\n{NICKNAME}: Don't worry, I wouldn't let them take you, Paimon.\nPaimon: That's more like it.\n{NICKNAME}: We'd just go to jail and suffer punishment together...\nPaimon: Uh...

Cannon!\n{NICKNAME}: It looks really powerful... And yet, we didn't see it do anything while we were in Tatarasuna.\nPaimon: It seems like the Resistance knew how strong it was, so before formally waging war against the Shogunate, they had covertly occupied this place.\nPaimon: But this Kamui... Kamuijima Cannon needs either special ammunition or Electro to work, so it's no use to the Resistance.\nPaimon: The Shogunate army put so much time and effort into creating this weapon... Paimon really wants to see the extent of its power.\n{NICKNAME}: If all you need is an Electro user, perhaps I can help.\nPaimon: That's right!

When we first arrived at the Komore Teahouse, Paimon really thought that Taroumaru would be able to speak...\n{NICKNAME}: You sound a bit disappointed.\nPaimon: Of course!

Paimon just thought of another one. This one's quite good—\nPaimon: \"Just look at this visitor! Paimon, is it? Look at how cute and clever she is. Today, all her meals are on the house! *woof*\"\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way Taroumaru would say something like that.\nPaimon: Hee-hee...",

Oh, I found something!\nPaimon: Really? Aw, {NICKNAME}, Paimon always knew you were reliable!\n{NICKNAME}: Ta-da!

Wow!\n{NICKNAME}: If that's the case, then perhaps you can submit a draft of the book you've been working on, \"Paimon's Happiness.\"\nPaimon: Well, about that... Paimon has misplaced the drafts on our way to Inazuma...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Really?\nPaimon: Fine! Paimon hasn't started writing it yet...\nPaimon: It's not Paimon's fault! Paimon's been meaning to do it but three days ago, Paimon's pen broke. The day before yesterday, Paimon had hand cramps. Yesterday — a sprained foot. Today... Paimon... Hmmm... Paimon's hungry!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, it sounds like you'll sooner write \"A Thousand Excuses with Paimon\" than \"Paimon's Happiness.\"",

That doesn't sound too shabby...\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you aren't thinking of sneaking off to go on a solo adventure, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Aw, I would never leave you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Paimon's really happy to hear that.

            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tPaimon: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon, you look so serious today.\nPaimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.\nPaimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families. They have an endless supply of Mora and mountains of delicious food to eat...\n{NICKNAME}: I can't disagree. Those are exactly the things you're fond of.\nPaimon: But after getting to know Ayaka better, Paimon realized that a young lady from a noble family can also have her share of hardships.\nPaimon: She needs to shoulder her clan's duties and responsibilities. She works so hard and has very little time for herself.\nPaimon: Ayaka must be exhausted, she should try to relax a bit...\nPaimon: Ah, that's right! Let's invite Ayaka to the next festival!\nPaimon: If she got an invite from us, there's no way she'd refuse.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, I'd like to go to another festival with her.\nPaimon: Besides, if Ayaka's around, she can pick up the tab for us...\n{NICKNAME}: ...I should've seen that coming...",
            "About Imitating Ayaka\tPaimon: Ayaka gives a sense of noble elegance with every gesture she makes.\n{NICKNAME}: Can you do an Ayaka impression, Paimon?\nPaimon: Let's give it a try.\nPaimon: \"Oh my, you've been picking mushrooms so earnestly just to make Chicken-Mushroom Skewers for me?\"\nPaimon: \"How cute...\"\n{NICKNAME}: That was nothing like Ayaka.

            "About Festival Traditions\tPaimon: It's a well-established tradition that during Inazuman celebrations everyone's wearing festive masks.\nPaimon: Paimon tried to look around the stalls, but hasn't found any mask that fits...\n{NICKNAME}: So you really want a mask of your own?\nPaimon: Of course! Not wearing a mask during an Inazuman festival is the same as not receiving a bouquet at the Windblume Festival...\n{NICKNAME}: Let me make one for you.\nPaimon: Whoa! {NICKNAME}, you're the best!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm, I wonder what kind of mask will fit you best? How about... a slime mask?\nPaimon: Yay, Paimon Slime!",

Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...\nPaimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?\nPaimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?\nPaimon: Uh... Um...\nPaimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...\n{NICKNAME}: Then you'd need to leave me.\nPaimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!\nPaimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...\n{NICKNAME}: Actually, she can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind, but I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.\nPaimon: Eh?

We're almost out of Mora. I guess we'll have to tighten the purse strings for the next few days...\nPaimon: Wh-What? Noooo!\n{NICKNAME}: See, you're not as carefree as you thought.\nPaimon: Ooh... How could you prank Paimon like that...",
            "About Onikabuto\tPaimon: Those Onikabuto bugs look so scary! The patterns on their backs are terrifying!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you mean those demonic patterns? It's because they don't like to fight, so they purposely evolved their patterns in a way that scares their enemies away.\nPaimon: That's really smart. We should try to learn a thing or two from them!\nPaimon: We could borrow Xiao's mask. If a hilichurl saw you wearing it, do you think they'd run in fear?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I don't think Xiao would agree to that...\nPaimon: Yeah... Hmm, how about we ask Sayu to steal his mask for us?\nPaimon: She knows ninjutsu that allows her to vanish into thin air. She can steal it for sure! Problem solved!\nPaimon: Uh... If we are afraid of Xiao evening the score with us, how about we steal Childe's mask? We've kicked his butt many times before!\n{NICKNAME}: I don't think stealing other people's belongings is a good idea. Also, what if Sayu doesn't agree to all of this?\nPaimon: Th—Then let's... Let's visit Albedo first.\nPaimon: If Albedo can develop a growth serum for Sayu, she'll help us for sure!\n{NICKNAME}: Brilliant, now we just need you to come up with a way to make Albedo help us.\nPaimon: Ugh!

            "About Naku Weed\tPaimon: Even though Naku Weed has a flower-like structure, its \"petals\" are in fact leaves.\nPaimon: Its actual bloom is rather fragile, so the surrounding leaves try their hardest to grow strong and protect it...\nPaimon: Hee-hee, just like Paimon is protecting you right now.\n{NICKNAME}: Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?\nPaimon: Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?",
            "About Naku Weed and Storms\tPaimon: Did you know? The people in Inazuma use the vibrations of Naku Weed to forecast thunderstorms.\nPaimon: Because Naku Weed grows in areas that are infused with Electro, it's naturally drawn to thunder and lightning.\n{NICKNAME}: Does that mean Naku Weed is similar to you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Eh? How so?\n{NICKNAME}: You know, because you usually hang out in areas infused with gourmet food and are naturally drawn to tasty snacks!\nPaimon: Hee-hee, that's true!\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon radar activated...\nPaimon: *beep* Delicacies, here we go!",
            "About Sakura Blooms\tPaimon: The blossoms drifting down from the Sacred Sakura are so dazzling!\nPaimon: Paimon heard that those flower petals can stay suspended in the air for so long because of being infused with Electro.\n{NICKNAME}: Is it the same principle behind your levitation abilities?\nPaimon: Uh... Ah... That's because...\n{NICKNAME}: You do know what allows you to fly, don't you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon can fly because of... mysterious powers, obviously!\n{NICKNAME}: Got it.

There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!\n{NICKNAME}: A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.\nPaimon: Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Really?

Unfortunately, it seems like only the big shots are granted entry.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Let's head back to the Dadaupa Gorge in Mondstadt!\nPaimon: Eh? Why so sudden?\n{NICKNAME}: Back in the Dadaupa Gorge, the hilichurls have a huge cauldron that's heated by Flaming Flowers. It should be similar to a hot spring, right? You can bathe in their... soup, I guess?\nPaimon: ???",
            "About Jugemu\tPaimon: In Inazuma, it's customary for parents to choose a lucky name for their child.\n{NICKNAME}: Those names symbolize everyone's expectations and wishes for the child, like prosperity, wealth, good health, and safety.\nPaimon: Because of these expectations, parents often pick extra long names, and cram all sorts of blessings into them.\n{NICKNAME}: So hypothetically, if one day a little girl fell into a lake on her way back home, then her friends might rush to her house to tell everyone, \"Something bad happened!\"\nPaimon: \"Oh, what happened?\"\n{NICKNAME}: Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, Prinzessin der Verurteilung Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, come quick! Centennial Genius Astrologist Mona Megistus has fallen into the water!\nPaimon: ...Mona falling into the water doesn't sound like an emergency situation though.\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. The fast-swimming Mona would come back home around the same time her friends are done saying her name, haha.",
            "About Inazuma's Islands\tPaimon: Inazuma's scenery is quite different than what we've seen so far.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, Inazuma's an island nation.\nPaimon: Before the invention of boats, how did the people living on different islands communicate with one another?\n{NICKNAME}: According to Yoimiya's dad, they probably used smoke signals to transmit information.\n{NICKNAME}: Or, they would...\nPaimon: Yeah...?\n{NICKNAME}: They would commission people who could freeze the water surface to travel between the islands and deliver messages.\nPaimon: Whoa! If Kaeya had lived in Inazuma back then, he would've been even busier than Master Jean now!",
            "About Tanuki\tPaimon: Tanuki are really mysterious creatures.\n{NICKNAME}: I think they are really cute.\nPaimon: Yeah, they're cute... until they start talking.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, I wonder... If you couldn't talk, would you appear to be more mysterious and noble?\nPaimon: Are you trying to mock me?\n{NICKNAME}: *randomly humming innocently*",
            "About Tanuki and Their Illusions\tPaimon: Did anyone tell you that there are monsters called tanuki in Inazuma that can take on the form of any human they see?\n{NICKNAME}: I heard such rumors before. They must know some mysterious transformation techniques.\nPaimon: What if one day a tanuki tricked you by transforming into Paimon? Oh no... Paimon's worried now! \n{NICKNAME}: No worries, I'd surely be able to tell the difference— Wait! You're just concerned about my Mora, aren't you?\nPaimon: Of course... Ah! ...No, no! Paimon's only concerned about your safety, {NICKNAME}!\nPaimon: Hmph, stop looking at Paimon like that. *pouting* Look, just think about it! If there were two Paimons, how would you find out which one is the real one?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Eh-he.\nPaimon: What do you mean \"eh-he\"!?\n{NICKNAME}: See, only the real Paimon would respond like that.\nPaimon: Ah! Paimon got tricked again...",
            "About Other Shrines\tPaimon: We've been passing by a lot of small shrines lately, but none of them seem to be dedicated to the Electro Archon.\n{NICKNAME}: They were probably built for lesser deities. The people of Inazuma believe that everything around them has a spirit, and those spirits will help them in their time of need.\nPaimon: Oh, so the people make shrines for them, and give them offerings.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. In a way, it's a form of prayer and a token of appreciation.\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now! Let's find Ayaka, and have her put up a shrine for us!\nPaimon: If we do that, we'll be able to get lots of offerings as well!\nPaimon: Paimon's so happy!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe. Uh... I—Is that an acceptable thing to do?\nPaimon: What's wrong? Haven't we been helping out everyone this whole time? We may be doing an even better job than those deities!\n{NICKNAME}: You do have a point...\n{NICKNAME}: But when I picture people placing flowers or fruits in front of a shrine for me... it doesn't feel right.",
            "About the Rain on Yashiori Island\t{NICKNAME}: It never stops raining on Yashiori Island. I heard it's because of the lingering evil energy.\nPaimon: \"Evil energy\"? What's that? Sounds terrifying.\n{NICKNAME}: It's caused by the remains of an evil god somewhere on the island. Because its power hasn't fully dispersed, the remaining energy causes all sorts of misfortunes. That's what I meant when I said \"evil energy.\"\nPaimon: Oh, that makes sense. But Paimon doesn't think rain is a bad thing.\nPaimon: Maybe that god has been crying all this time because they were bullied.\n{NICKNAME}: Crying? I don't think gods can cry. I mean, I've never seen Venti or Zhongli cry before.\nPaimon: There are exceptions! If you pinch Paimon, you'll be able to see a crying god.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? Are you a god?\nPaimon: Paimon sure is!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, let me guess... The flying god of silly questions? The god of slimes? Or the god of being fished out from the water?\nPaimon: Paimon's none of those! Hmph!\nPaimon: As your bodyguard, {NICKNAME}, Paimon is the god of protection! Hehe.",
            "About Bantan Sango Detective Agency\t{NICKNAME}: In Hanamizaka, there's a place called the Bantan Sango Detective Agency.\nPaimon: Paimon remembers. It's the one run by Sango and Ryuuji, right? Everyone speaks highly of them.\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, I heard that they frequently get caught up in strange incidents, and some places have banned them from entering their premises...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that's undeserved. After all, Sango and Ryuuji have helped a lot of people...\n{NICKNAME}: Would you invite them if you were organizing a dinner party?\n{NICKNAME}: What if halfway through the meal, one of the guests suddenly shrieked and collapsed onto the ground...\nPaimon: I—If that's the case, then Paimon thinks it's a bad idea. Paimon suddenly feels that hanging out with them could be dangerous...\n{NICKNAME}: Well, that's the price you pay for being a famous detective.",
            "About Drawing Fortune Slips\tPaimon: Oh yeah, have you drawn fortune slips at the shrine before, {NICKNAME}?\nPaimon: If we draw them before our next adventure, they may provide us with some guidance.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, but what if our draws are inauspicious or turn out to be a bad omen? If that happened, we'd probably end up in a bad mood...\nPaimon: Oh, that's fine. According to the shrine maidens, if someone draws a bad omen, they just need to hang it on a tree in the shrine...\nPaimon: So, we should keep on drawing and drawing, until we get a super lucky draw! Then, we'll hang all the bad ones on the tree!\n{NICKNAME}: If everyone did that, there'd be no more space left to hang the slips...",
            "About Musou no Hitotachi\tPaimon: Musou no Hitotachi is amazing!\nPaimon: It can beat any enemy with a single slash!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, but for Childe, it might need three slashes...\nPaimon: Y—Yeah!\nPaimon: Anyway, if you mastered that technique, Paimon wouldn't have to worry about you for the rest of our journey!\n{NICKNAME}: So, where can one learn that technique?\nPaimon: Yeah, where can one learn that technique?\n{NICKNAME}: Hm?\nPaimon: Quit looking at Paimon like that! O—Okay, Paimon will keep an eye on you during our adventures...",
            "About Sangonomiya Kokomi\tPaimon: Did you know, {NICKNAME}? That Sangonomiya Kokomi, she's Watatsumi Island's Divine Priestess.\nPaimon: In other words, she's the ruler of Watatsumi Island! The whole of Watatsumi Island is controlled by her.\nPaimon: Paimon also wants to become a big shot like her...\n{NICKNAME}: What will you do after you become a big shot?\nPaimon: Then, Paimon will deliver justice. For example... Ahem.\nPaimon: The suspect in question, known as the Traveler, ate two Dango for lunch and only gave one to the victim, Paimon. This is a serious violation of article thirty seven, \"Fairness and Justice,\" of the \"Paimon Decree.\"\n{NICKNAME}: Oh... may I ask how Your Excellency Paimon plans to resolve this issue?\nPaimon: Of course. As compensation for your wrongdoings, you will have to make even more Dango for Paimon, hee-hee!",
            "About Transience\tPaimon: Paimon wonders what the previous Shogun was like.\n{NICKNAME}: It appears that she was a person who understood the fleeting nature of things, and accepted the inevitable fate of departing this world one day.\nPaimon: After all, realizing the fragility of things in front of you makes you treasure them even more.\n{NICKNAME}: This way of thinking must've influenced Inazuma's aesthetics. This world is transient, people come and go. The fun times we shared, our companionship, and the delicious foods we got to savor — those emotions and experiences are real things that existed at some point in time, not just empty concepts.\nPaimon: Even though... Even though every banquet must eventually come to an end, it'd be nice to enjoy those happy moments for a little longer.\n{NICKNAME}: \"Shifting seasons and elusive dreams, the ephemeral and fleeting, with thine companionship, all are eternal.\"\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't get it!\n{NICKNAME}: I'm saying that I'm having a lot of fun traveling with you, Paimon. It'd be nice if we could just go on like this forever.\nPaimon: Paimon'll take your word for it then.",
            "About Shrine Maidens\tPaimon: The clothes that shrine maidens wear are quite unique.\n{NICKNAME}: I heard that after the Sakoku Decree is lifted, Yae Miko plans to run a rental service where people can try on shrine maiden outfits as a tourist attraction in various places. Combined with the latest Kamera technology from Fontaine, it seems like a real Mora maker.\nPaimon: Oh!\n{NICKNAME}: {MThe shrine maidens in the Grand Shrine even asked me if I knew any pretty girls who are willing to become models. All they need to do is to dress up in a shrine maiden outfit and smile to the Kamera. They even asked me to be a model and said all I needed was some makeup.}{FThe shrine maidens in the Grand Shrine even asked me if I was interested in becoming a model! All I need to do is wear a shrine maiden outfit and smile to the Kamera. They also asked me if I knew any other cute girls.}\nPaimon: What!?\n{NICKNAME}: I immediately shared this idea with Rosaria. I feel like they can do something similar at the Church of Favonius with the garments they wear.\nPaimon: Wait, Paimon doesn't think that a...\n{NICKNAME}: Sadly, Rosaria found the idea of it too troublesome.\nPaimon: Maybe it's for the better...",
            "About the Artist Utamarou\tPaimon: Aoi gave Paimon a painting. Turns out it's not edible, but Paimon is still very happy with that gift!\n{NICKNAME}: Aoi? The general goods shop owner? Let me see.\nPaimon: Here, but be careful. It was painted by a famous artist, Utamarou. It's quite valuable!\n{NICKNAME}: Utamarou? Hmm... I think I've heard that name before...\nPaimon: Of course, master Utamarou's works can be found all around Inazuma after all!\nPaimon: Did you see one of them in Ayaka's residence? The one that Paimon has right now isn't too shabby either.\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, I remember now! One of those paintings was used by Yoimiya as kindling, right?\nPaimon: Eh? Kindling?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, yeah! I think Thoma used it as padding for table legs as well.\nPaimon: What? Padding?\n{NICKNAME}: And, if I remember correctly, I also saw Sayu use a stack of those paintings as a cushion for her nap.\nPaimon: Sayu has several of those works? That can't be right...\n{NICKNAME}: Real masterpieces aren't mass-produced. If you ask me, that Utamarou isn't a real master at all.\nPaimon: Hey—",
            "About the Teahouse and Its Owner\tPaimon: The Komore Teahouse is doing surprisingly well. They have a great number of visitors every day.\nPaimon: We should also open a teahouse. Paimon feels that it'd be really profitable!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Well, if we do end up opening a teahouse, then you're gonna be the boss, for sure.\nPaimon: Eh? Deal!\nPaimon: Paimon didn't think that you'd have so much faith in Paimon's abilities... Paimon will make sure to be a responsible manager, and make our shop the best teahouse in Teyvat!\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh, I don't think it'd need to be managed... Do you remember Taroumaru?\nPaimon: Yup, he's the owner of the Komore Teahouse, right? A lot of the clients go to the Teahouse to play with him rather than drink tea.\n{NICKNAME}: So I was thinking, if you were running the shop, you'd definitely be more popular than Taroumaru.\nPaimon: Hee-hee, of course... Hey! So you don't really trust Paimon's management skills, you just want a mascot!?",
            "About the Sakoku Decree\t{NICKNAME}: With the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, I guess the Sakoku Decree will be the next one to go.\nPaimon: Here's hoping that everything goes well.\n{NICKNAME}: Let's encourage everyone to hold on for just a bit longer.\nPaimon: Yeah!\n{NICKNAME}: If we get the chance, let's find Atsuko and tell her that the sakura trees in her homeland are blooming.\nPaimon: How is that supposed to comfort her!?",
            "About Kimonos\tPaimon: *sigh* Ogura Mio says that she hardly has any fancy kimonos in stock these days. So, chances are that you won't be able to buy one, even if you can afford it.\nPaimon: It's a real tragedy... Paimon wants to look glamorous, too.\n{NICKNAME}: But the Sakoku Decree's been abolished... She should be able to import silk from Liyue now.\nPaimon: *gasp* You're right! Great, so there's hope for Paimon's kimono-dream after all!\nPaimon: Just imagine it... Paimon emerges from Ogura's shop wearing a custom-made pure-silk one-of-a-kind kimono. Total transformation! This Paimon's going places!\nPaimon: No longer just a sidekick in the legendary Traveler's adventure story... Oh no, say hello to Paimon the Elegant, wearer of fine silks and fated friend of heroes!\nPaimon: Ahhh... Wouldn't that be amazing?\nPaimon: ...It would, wouldn't it, {NICKNAME}? Um, so—\n{NICKNAME}: What I'm hearing is... you want me to pay for your new wardrobe.\nPaimon: Exactly, you read Paimon's mind! See, that's what being \"fated friends\" is all about!\nPaimon: Um, so Paimon was thinking seven different styles, one for each day of the week. Still not sure on the specific designs though, let Paimon think...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Uh, suddenly, I'm not so interested in buying.",
            "About Canned Knowledge\tPaimon: Free knowledge without having to study at all? Canned Knowledge is amazing!\nPaimon: Could Sumeru have Canned Knowledge about the different customs of the seven nations, too?\nPaimon: If so, Paimon could just open a can every time we get to a new place. Paimon wouldn't have to explain things ever again!\n{NICKNAME}: Or we could just open them all here in Sumeru.\nPaimon: But... but traveling wouldn't be any fun without surprises to look forward to!\n{NICKNAME}: Ooh, plus, if we opened them all here, I wouldn't even need Paimon as a guide anymore.\nPaimon: Okay scrap that idea! No more Canned Knowledge, let's save our Mora for something else!\nPaimon: Something like... Oh! Tipping Paimon for guide services! Heehee, seems fair, right?",
            "About The Eremites\tPaimon: The Eremites are a real motley crew...\n{NICKNAME}: There's certainly a diverse range of characters.\nPaimon: Hmmm... yeah, that could explain it! Paimon can play lots of different characters too.\nPaimon: Judgy Paimon, knowledgeable Paimon, helpful Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And of course the classic, completely-misses-the-point Paimon.",
            "About Beliefs\tPaimon: Have you noticed something? People in Sumeru don't seem to have a lot of faith in Lesser Lord Kusanali.\nPaimon: Back in Liyue and Inazuma, people were pretty enthusiastic about Rex Lapis and the Almighty Shogun.\nPaimon: Those strange scholars are one thing, but even everyone living downtown only ever seems to talk about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. And the most delicious mushrooms are said to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's blessing.\nPaimon: Speaking of which, lots of the dishes in Liyue are said to have been taught and approved by Rex Lapis himself...\nPaimon: Aha! So as long as a god blesses their people with delicious food, people will worship them!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, if their name is Paimon, sure.\nPaimon: Huh? Wait, so... {NICKNAME}, what do you believe in, then?\n{NICKNAME}: Me? Hmm... Paimon, of course.\nPaimon: Heehee, that's right!",
            "About the Wall of Samiel\tPaimon: The first time we saw the Wall of Samiel, Paimon was stunned... It seems to go on forever.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, it was built to protect the entire rainforest, after all.\nPaimon: And, it's so, so tall...\nPaimon: Who knows if {NICKNAME}'ll be able to climb all the way to the top.\n{NICKNAME}: I doubt it...? Also, why do I have to climb it, exactly?\nPaimon: Uh... because it's right there?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, even so... No.\nPaimon: The Wall of Samiel is right there in front of us!\n{NICKNAME}: I know, I know, but it's way too—\nPaimon: But it's the Wall of Samiel...\n{NICKNAME}: Fine! I'll go, okay?",
            "About Akasha Terminals\tPaimon: All these Sumeru scholars seem to wear Akasha Terminals so they can get information from the Akasha system.\nPaimon: It's like they're carrying an interactive encyclopedia with them wherever they go. Paimon's kinda jealous.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm not jealous. I have an even better encyclopedia that automatically follows me around, gives me the A-to-Z on everything in Teyvat, and the best part is, it can even talk!\nPaimon: Huh? Was that a compliment? Aw, you're making Paimon blush... Paimon definitely doesn't know as much as an encyclopedia! A-to-Y at most.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you know... maybe if you ate a little less, you'd have room for Z, too.\nPaimon: Hey!!!",

Whew, Aranara names are so hard to remember...\nPaimon: The only bit Paimon's sure of is that they all start with \"Ara\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Right, so if you were an Aranara, your name would be \"Arapaimon.\"\nPaimon: Yup, and as for {NICKNAME}...\nPaimon: Hmm, actually, they'd probably call you Nara {NICKNAME}...\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, we're all Nara to them...\nPaimon: So if there was someone whose actual name was \"Nara,\" what would the Aranara call them?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Nara Nara\"... I guess. Sounds kinda cute.\nPaimon: Hehe, yeah.",

Still, those mushrooms and fruits were so raw, it felt like they were gonna keep growing in Paimon's stomach!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh, you're exaggerating, right? You do have a point, though — maybe the best ingredients don't need a lot of fancy cooking.\nPaimon: You're right. If the ingredients are good enough, they'll taste great even when cooked with the simplest methods.\n{NICKNAME}: Just like Paimon. Just a little salt and pepper, and—\nPaimon: Hey! For crying out loud, we're in Sumeru now! Don't you think that joke's getting a little old?",

There's no way Paimon would fit in there!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well... if you want, you can be the genie of the Serenitea Pot instead?\nPaimon: Oooh, great idea! Paimon's down!\n{NICKNAME}: You seem pretty excited about this...\nPaimon: Uh, yeah! Paimon's been wanting to try this for ages! ...Poof! Didst thou summon me, O Traveler from a distant land?\nPaimon: Come on, come on, now you have to grant Paimon three wishes! Paimon's first wish is... bring Paimon lots of delicious food!\n{NICKNAME}: Hey, you're not supposed to be the one making wishes!",
            "About Bimarstan\tPaimon: Whoa, healthcare is FREE in Sumeru?\n{NICKNAME}: Are you feeling unwell, Paimon?\nPaimon: No, not right now. Thanks for asking, though.\nPaimon: Hehe... Eating the street food on every corner has never sounded so tempting!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, your stomach is gonna punish you for that!\nPaimon: If so, Paimon'll go see a doctor and get treated — it's all for free! It'd be a waste not to take advantage of this, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe... but then again, the treatment would likely include a restricted diet.\nPaimon: *gasp* Oh no! So no more delicious food, then?\n{NICKNAME}: That, plus the doctor would make you take the most bitter-tasting medicine ever.\nPaimon: O—Okay... Maybe Paimon needs to reconsider this idea...",
            "About the Scholars\tPaimon: So many people in Sumeru want to become scholars.\nPaimon: Motivated by this ambition, they all study really hard to try and achieve it...\nPaimon: But Paimon bets that the first ever scholar didn't set out to become a scholar...\nPaimon: Hmm... so what do you think the first ever scholar's ambition was?\n{NICKNAME}: Probably... to get their research paper written as quickly as possible.\nPaimon: Huh? But isn't a scholar's ultimate goal supposed to be \"pursuing the highest and greatest knowledge\" or something?\nPaimon: Paimon's sure that it must have been because of a fervent desire for knowledge that they became Sumeru's first true scholar.\n{NICKNAME}: Writing papers is how you pursue knowledge.\nPaimon: But what about when it's the highest and greatest knowledge of all...\n{NICKNAME}: Even then, if you wanted to prove it, you'd need a research paper.\n{NICKNAME}: And after that, you'd need to start working on another paper to validate your original thesis...\nPaimon: O—Okay, Paimon's got it! Come on, don't look so sad! It's not like you have to worry about writing papers yourself!\nPaimon: ...Y—You've never had to write a paper before, right...?",
            "About Amurta\tPaimon: Paimon wants to go visit the Amurta scholars!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, when did you become such an avid student, Paimon?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon heard that the Amurta scholars' research is all about nature.\nPaimon: Which means... they must have to research which animals are edible, and which ones taste the best, and... y'know that kind of thing!\nPaimon: Paimon thinks it'd be really fun to help them out with their research.\n{NICKNAME}: In other words, you've got a craving for some tasty, organic dishes.\nPaimon: No! Paimon genuinely thinks that it's a really meaningful research topic and wants to help out!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, well in that case... I think the Amurta scholars might be more interested to find out about Paimon's species and behavioral patterns.\nPaimon: Uh... Gee is that the time? Paimon just remembered we have something else more important to do!",
            "About Sumpter Beasts\tPaimon: Sumpter Beasts are adorable! Paimon likes how the people who keep them give them each a special name based on their most distinctive traits!\n{NICKNAME}: For all we know, the Sumpter Beasts might be giving each of us a name in return. Maybe that's how they respond when we call their name.\nPaimon: Really? So what kind of name do think they'd give us?\n{NICKNAME}: (Sumpter Beast noises)\nPaimon: How is anyone supposed to understand that!\n{NICKNAME}: A rough translation would be...\n{NICKNAME}: \"Vociferous Pestiferous Melliculus Niveous Micro-Bipedal.\"\n{NICKNAME}: That's the scientific name, of course.\nPaimon: Oh? What would the common name be then?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Noisy Two-Legged Critter\"\nPaimon: Hey! Why keep only the negative traits?",

Paimonology!\n{NICKNAME}: What wisdom would Paimonology stand for?\nPaimon: Uh... practical wisdom for everyday life!\n{NICKNAME}: So Paimonology scholars would specialize in the art of cooking slimes in a hundred different ways, never letting a single Mora escape their grasp, giving people ugly nicknames... et cetera?\nPaimon: Whoa, you read Paimon's mind! Also, don't forget \"How to Become the Best Travel Guide in Teyvat\"!\nPaimon: This is a fantastic idea! Come on, let's go submit a Darshan application to the Akademiya!

            "About Shroomboars\tPaimon: Did you know that there are all kinds of strange Shroom-Kin in Sumeru?\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, yeah. Here's a fun one — legend has it that there were some forest boars who couldn't live without mushrooms, and the two species gradually formed a symbiotic relationship with each other. Now they're known as \"Shroomboars.\"\nPaimon: Woah, that's a lot like us! Paimon can't live without {NICKNAME} either.\n{NICKNAME}: If you can't live without me, that means...

Paimon wishes she could do that.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, if you're serious about it, there's no reason you couldn't learn.\nPaimon: What? Really?\n{NICKNAME}: Well for starters, you have a natural advantage when it comes to dancing.\n{NICKNAME}: You won't trip over yourself, or accidentally step on someone else's foot...\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon always forgets how useful flying can be!\nPaimon: Alright then! Let's go bust a move at the Grand Bazaar and watch everyone shower Paimon with admiration!\n{NICKNAME}: Aha, so that's what this is all about.",
            "About Divination\tPaimon: People in Sumeru seem to take divination and fortune-telling pretty seriously.\nPaimon: For starters, there's astrology, although only the scholars get to practice that. But ordinary citizens have their ways, too. They can do divinations with just a cup of coffee!\n{NICKNAME}: It's the nation of wisdom after all. It seems like people have an insatiable curiosity to learn about everything, including their own future.\nPaimon: Paimon heard that they can tell your fate just by looking at the bottom of a finished cup of coffee...\nPaimon: Sounds way easier than climbing to the top of a tower and staring at the stars all night!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, so you're interested in learning your fate now?\nPaimon: Yeah... although, Paimon's really more interested in finding out what the coffee tastes like.",
            "About Purbiruni and Pursina\tPaimon: Khedive and Anisa kept talking about \"Purbiruni\" this and \"Pursina\" that...\nPaimon: Why do all these words have \"pur\" at the front?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, \"Pur\" means \"descendant,\" and also \"student\"... So in this case, they're referring to themselves as the children and students of the great sages of old.\nPaimon: Huh, so that's what it means... From the way they were throwing these words around, Paimon was sure it'd be something to be proud of.\n{NICKNAME}: Wait... But isn't it?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon for one would much rather be known as the founding father than have a name that basically says \"So-and-so's my daddy.\" Pretty embarrassing, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Um... I have to admit, I've never thought about it like that...",
            "About Studying Abroad\tPaimon: It's not only Sumeru locals at the Akademiya, huh. There are students from other nations too.\nPaimon: Imagine leaving your hometown behind and traveling to a faraway and unfamiliar land in the pursuit of learning... How inspiring!\n{NICKNAME}: We travel to unfamiliar lands pretty often, too.\nPaimon: Huh, you're right! That means we're also super inspiring!\n{NICKNAME}: Not in the pursuit of learning, though.\nPaimon: Oh... So we're not as inspiring as the students after all...\nPaimon: Buuut we do know the best places to eat in Sumeru, and who you can rely on to help you out! That counts as knowledge, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, and to many people, it could be extremely valuable knowledge.\nPaimon: Great, so we're just as inspiring as them after all!",
            "About the Divine Tree\tPaimon: The whole of Sumeru City is built on top of a giant tree. How amazing is that!\nPaimon: We've seen lots of incredible trees on our journey, haven't we? There's our old stomping ground at Windrise, the Frostbearing Tree on Dragonspine, and the Sacred Sakura in Inazuma!\nPaimon: Sumeru's tree doesn't seem to have a fancy name though. People just call it \"the Divine Tree\"...\n{NICKNAME}: Sometimes, the most important things have the simplest names.\nPaimon: Really? Hmm, maybe you have a point. Long names would be kinda inconvenient if you had to say them every day.\nPaimon: Anyway, people in the city only have to say \"down below\" and everyone knows they mean the bottom of the tree.\nPaimon: What's that saying again? \"Names aren't things themselves, they're just words for things.\"\n{NICKNAME}: So is Paimon just a word for a thing, too?\nPaimon: Yeah. Well, uh, kinda. But... wait, no! No, Paimon is just Paimon!",
            "About Inter-Darshan Relations\tPaimon: So, with Sumeru having so many scholars in different Darshans, do you think they end up arguing a lot?\nPaimon: You know, just like the rivalry between Li cuisine and Yue cuisine in Liyue.\n{NICKNAME}: I'm sure they do. Conflict between different schools of thought is the most normal thing ever. As the Liyue martial arts novels say: \"Wherever there are people, there will be conflict.\"\nPaimon: Wow, what a line. That's heavy... But the scholars in Sumeru probably don't duel like Liyue martial artists, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe they settle things with a game of Genius Invokation TCG.\nPaimon: Ohh, good point! A duel of wits!\nPaimon: Paimon can just imagine it: When one scholar can't convince another in an argument, he takes out his deck of cards, calmly sits down opposite his opponent, thinks for a moment, and then secures his victory!\n{NICKNAME}: That does sound like something that would happen in Sumeru.\nPaimon: The game ends, and the winner says \"good game\" as a sign of respect to his opponent. After that, both sides are back on good terms.\n{NICKNAME}: Um... saying that would probably only escalate the conflict.\nPaimon: Huh? Why?",
            "About Port Ormos\tPaimon: Whew, Port Ormos definitely has a different vibe to Sumeru City...\nPaimon: It's a bustling area, and there's so many outlanders. Plus, no one needs to spend all their time buried in their studies, which is nice.\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that's why they end up being disciplined by the port authorities. So you see, Paimon? If you don't study hard, you'll end up just like them!\nPaimon: Oh...\nPaimon: Wait! What was that tone of voice for!?",
            "About the Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys\tPaimon: Port Ormos is built on the ruins of the fortress of The Alliance of the... the... the alliance of something, anyway.\nPaimon: Ugh, the name's too long, Paimon can't remember it! Anyway, that's what all the bookish people in Sumeru say.\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, you mean \"The Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys\"?\n{NICKNAME}: Apparently, the alliance was formed by a bunch of arrogant pirate leaders, none of whom wanted to work for any of the others. They fought and looted each other constantly, causing endless chaos in coastal Sumeru...\n{NICKNAME}: Finally, one day, they decided to enter into an alliance with one another and divide power equally between themselves. The members of the alliance were called \"Deys\"...\nPaimon: Oh... And so after that... there was no more fighting and no more stealing, so everyone could get along happily and make a boatload of Mora together! Right?\n{NICKNAME}: ...\nPaimon: Right...?\n{NICKNAME}: Well... presumably that's what they were hoping...\nPaimon: Huh...?\n{NICKNAME}: Before long, they were forming factions again, and the infighting between them escalated into the biggest internal battle they'd seen yet. Their fortress at Port Ormos was completely destroyed, and all the Deys were done for!\nPaimon: Whaaat?\n{NICKNAME}: Following that, an unprecedented period of peace finally came to Port Ormos, and the area began to develop into what we see today...\nPaimon: Huh... So the Alliance was just a bunch of dumb bad guys...",
            "About Cyno and Genius Invokation TCG...\tPaimon: Cyno's super into that card game \"Genius Invokation TCG,\" isn't he?\nPaimon: Doesn't it seem kinda weird for the General Mahamatra to be into playing cards...?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... not when you consider his hairstyle.\nPaimon: Huh? What has his hairstyle got to do with it?\n{NICKNAME}: When you're playing a card game, the fancier your hairstyle, the more distracting it is for your opponent.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What's going on with this guy? How did he manage to shape his hair like that?\"\n{NICKNAME}: When your opponent's mind is consumed with thoughts like this, you'll quickly gain the upper hand.\nPaimon: Hmm, really? Then we'd better think twice before playing against him...\n{NICKNAME}: I don't know... I think I might just have an advantage over him.\nPaimon: But you don't have a fancy hairstyle at all. And your clothes look pretty normal too...\n{NICKNAME}: But I do have Paimon.\n{NICKNAME}: You know, he'd be like: \"What's up with this guy? And what's that pesky flying companion of his up to?\"\n{NICKNAME}: As long as you're floating by my side, Cyno's mind will be consumed with thoughts like this.\n{NICKNAME}: I, on the other hand, would be completely unfazed by his hairstyle. So I'd be able to focus, and victory would be mine.\nPaimon: Forget it! If you wanna play cards, go get a funny haircut!",
            "About Sumeru Nursery Rhymes...\tPaimon: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ Hungry children it's time to come home~ ♪\n{NICKNAME}: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ ♪\nPaimon: Wow! Good job, so you remember the tune as well!\n{NICKNAME}: Good job to you too, Paimon. You sing really well.\nPaimon: Heehee, that's because Paimon's got a great plan!\nPaimon: Have you heard this story? Once upon a time, there was a hilihound who was given meat to eat whenever the samachurls started dancing. Eventually, the hilihound started drooling whenever it heard the sound of dancing.\nPaimon: Whenever we hear the curry song, we get curry to eat. So, all Paimon has to do is learn the song by heart, and then in the future, whenever Paimon is craving a big bowl of tasty curry, all she has to do is sing it!\nPaimon: Hey, aren't you gonna say something?\nPaimon: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ Hungry children it's time to come home~ ♪",
            "About Aranara Tongue Twisters...\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, do you ever find that the word \"Aranara\" trips you up?\nPaimon: Hmm? Why, does it trip you up? Maybe that's because you don't really say anything most of the time.\nPaimon: Unlike Paimon! Paimon has to talk all the time, so she never gets stuck on words.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well, try reading this then.\nPaimon: What is it? Let's see here...\nPaimon: Arana the Aranara exercises Ararakalari in the nearby area.\nPaimon: Narana the Nara picks Padisarahs in a parallel area further afield.\nPaimon: Narana the Padisarah-picking Nara had arranged to invite Arana the Aranara to the bar to befriend Lambad, but alas, Arana the Ararakalari-exercising Aranara professed a preference to Padisarah-picking Nara, Narana, for venturing to Vanarana to view the panorama.\nPaimon: On account of Arana the Aranara's antipathy to bar drama, Narana the Nara relented and, upon accompanying the latter on a Vanarana-panorama adventure, encountered another Aranara, named \"Arama.\"\nPaimon: This must be one of those really weird dreams, right...\nPaimon: Ugh, but this headache feels pretty real...",
            "About the Windmills\tPaimon: Mondstadt has so many windmills, doesn't it?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, the city is built above water, so it probably relies on windmills to draw the water upwards.\nPaimon: That's correct! The winds blow through Mondstadt all year, so this supply of water is very stable.\nPaimon: Also, the windmills are what they call \"visible winds\" — and wind chimes are called the \"audible winds.\"\nPaimon: Paimon guesses they can be thought of as mascots and prayers to the Anemo Archon for protection.\n{NICKNAME}: Ah, mascots. So, like you then, Paimon?\nPaimon: No! Not at all! They're made of wood, and you can't eat them in an emergency either, 'cause all you'll do is grind your teeth down!\n{NICKNAME}: Umm...\n{NICKNAME}: ...I don't know what to say to that.",
            "About the Tavern Owner\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that if you give tavern owners a considerable tip, they'll be willing to share some information on the down low.\nPaimon: You mean the Angel's Share? But Master Diluc seems like a very rich man.\nPaimon: How big a tip is \"considerable,\" anyway?\n{NICKNAME}: Huh... Maybe I might have heard wrong.\n{NICKNAME}: Or, maybe I might have heard this rumor in another world...\nPaimon: You sure have been to many worlds, haven't you?",
            "About Cider Lake\tPaimon: Cider Lake never freezes, no matter what time of year it is.\nPaimon: The best apple ciders in Mondstadt can only be made using the fresh water from this lake.\nPaimon: It really does taste great! Paimon could drink two big bottles in a second!\n{NICKNAME}: Wow.\nPaimon: Tee-hee!\n{NICKNAME}: With your size, I can't believe that you can drink that much liquid...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And not explode like an Anemo Slime.\nPaimon: Paimon has a special stomach just for tasty drinks!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh... I guess the world really is a big place. So many things to consider...",
            "About the Library's Restricted Section\t{NICKNAME}: About those books in the \"restricted section\" that Lisa mentioned...\n{NICKNAME}: Have you ever wondered what sort of books might be kept in there?\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps...\n{NICKNAME}: ...It contains books not suitable for children?\nPaimon: Huh? But \"The Boar Princess\" isn't in the restricted section!\nPaimon: What could be more unsuitable for children than that? ...Hmm, Paimon's curious...",
            "About Effort and Reward\tPaimon: Paimon finds that hard work hardly works here in Mondstadt.\n{NICKNAME}: Why do you say that?\nPaimon: Just look at Huffman from the Knights of Favonius. He does his best at his duties every day...\nPaimon: But the ever-relaxed Captain Kaeya is his boss.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... But isn't Jean, who works the hardest, the Acting Grand Master?\nPaimon: W—Well, how about this, then...\nPaimon: Venti's the god of Mondstadt, and he's the laziest of them all!",
            "About the Goth Grand Hotel\t{NICKNAME}: Ah... Sure would be nice to spend a night at the Goth Grand Hotel...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks so too!\nPaimon: The rooms are sure to be big and clean.\n{NICKNAME}: Still, I've heard Mr. Goth say that they've had all kinds of strange problems ever since the Fatui moved in.\n{NICKNAME}: The Electro Cicins that their mages brought in attracted a lot of dust with static electricity, which ended up killing a lot of those Cicins.\n{NICKNAME}: Then, someone mixed up the Mist Grass Pollen and the pepper...\n{NICKNAME}: And the Agents ended up brawling amongst themselves, each insisting that the other owed them money for wine.\nPaimon: ...Hang in there, Goth Grand Hotel...",
            "About the Way the Wind Blows\t{NICKNAME}: Everyone says that Mondstadt is the land of the wind.\n{NICKNAME}: But, I wonder which direction the seasonal winds come from.\nPaimon: Why don't we ask Venti?\n{NICKNAME}: He'll probably just dodge the question with a \"hehe\" or something...\nPaimon: True. The Anemo Archon is just a Tone-Deaf Bard. What does he know about the wind?",
            "About Alchemy\t{NICKNAME}: So here in Mondstadt, alchemy is practiced out on the streets?\nPaimon: Is that so strange?\n{NICKNAME}: In many of the worlds I've been to in the past, alchemy has always been a secretive art.\n{NICKNAME}: Watching alchemy being practiced as a part of daily life is like being in a world where people all have three stomachs...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks only having one stomach is weird!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh...\n{NICKNAME}: Are you serious?\nPaimon: What do you think?",
            "About Teyvat\t{NICKNAME}: Teyvat's day and night both seem particularly short.\n{NICKNAME}: The skies here are full of stars, but they aren't the same as the ones back home.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder if the fates of people from Teyvat are also related to their constellations.\nPaimon: Oh? Do you know how to read the stars, too? That's amazing! Not a lot of people outside Sumeru can do it.\nPaimon: Paimon's curious! Come on, do a reading for me, quick!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm...\n{NICKNAME}: The night sky pictured on Paimon's cape... flows with the light of many stars, and also of the deep ocean...\n{NICKNAME}: The movement of these stars... tells me that, uh... in, say, seven days from now...\nPaimon: ...In seven days what?\n{NICKNAME}: Something good, or something bad, might occur...\nPaimon: Heh, right... your theory sounds as rock solid as a Geo Slime... And about as brainy, too.",
            "About the God of Freedom\t{NICKNAME}: On the way back to Mondstadt after rescuing Dvalin...\n{NICKNAME}: We finally got to see one of the Seven Archons, didn't we? It was interesting to see what kind of god he was.\nPaimon: Hmm... Haven't we known Venti for quite a while now?\n{NICKNAME}: As Venti, yes... But still, this was the first time that we got to see him as the Anemo Archon, Barbatos.\n{NICKNAME}: Normally, he hides his true divinity behind the facade of a bard.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What does freedom really mean, when demanded of you by a god?\"\n{NICKNAME}: That was the question that he asked Dvalin... I'm still contemplating that... you know?",
            "About Mondstadt's Terrain\tPaimon: Mondstadt is full of wide plains and rolling hills.\nPaimon: People say that when Barbatos made this land, he used the storm to flatten the cliffs and valleys...\n{NICKNAME}: Still, it looks like he missed a few spots.\nPaimon: Like Starsnatch Cliff?\n{NICKNAME}: Exactly.\n{NICKNAME}: On the map, it almost looks as if it was meant to be the apex of a vertical structure, but ended up at the wrong orientation.\nPaimon: Wh—What's an \"apex\"?",
            "About Couplets\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that couplets are a traditional art form in Liyue. If you can write a line that works as a second half to one that someone else has written, you'll be well paid!\nPaimon: But linking the couplet is hard, so it's not easy money.\nPaimon: Not only does the rhythm need to match, but the meaning has to as well.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Care to give an example?\nPaimon: Uh... \"Windrise's winds never churn.\"\n{NICKNAME}: ...Um, \"But the Sea of Clouds' clouds always return.\"\nPaimon: Huh... Not bad!\nPaimon: Let's not waste time here. We've got some money to make!",
            "About \"Don't Play With Food, or With Money\"\tPaimon: There's a saying of Rex Lapis' that's commonly used here in Liyue. Paimon thinks its rough meaning is... \"Don't play with your money.\"\nPaimon: It's because the first Mora were minted from his golden form and given to humans in trust.\n{NICKNAME}: Kaeya sure seems to enjoy playing with his money...\nPaimon: And that's why you shouldn't learn from him.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, as a child, I was taught not to play with my food.\nPaimon: Yup, yup. You've got to respect your food.\nPaimon: ...Wh—What are you looking at Paimon for?",
            "About Heart's Desire\tPaimon: Walk in seven clockwise circles, then walk in seven anticlockwise circles, then open your eyes...\n{NICKNAME}: Are you... sleepwalking?\nPaimon: Nope! Paimon is just trying to see if that antique shop from \"Heart's Desire\" actually exists!\n{NICKNAME}: Well, assuming that a shop in a story does exist, what would you like to buy, Paimon?\nPaimon: A Slime Creator!\n{NICKNAME}: Does such a thing even exist?",
            "About the Guhua Clan\t{NICKNAME}: Lately, some Guhua Clan disciples have been retelling an ancient story.\nPaimon: The Guhua Clan, huh? Paimon bets it's a heroic story!\n{NICKNAME}: Several female disciples decided to partake of a contest of arms to see who would marry their male junior, and he approved.\nPaimon: Ooh, Paimon's heard this one. In Liyue, they call this \"a joust for a spouse\"!\n{NICKNAME}: But the night before the contest, he stole the eldest disciple's favorite sword.\nPaimon: Ah, so he wanted her to lose... Poor girl...\n{NICKNAME}: I know, right? Forced to use a sword she wasn't used to, the eldest disciple suffered a crushing defeat.\n{NICKNAME}: Unable to accept this result, she fell to her knees and wept.\nPaimon: Oh no... She must have really loved him, right?\n{NICKNAME}: In the end, she was forced to marry him in front of everyone. Hahaha.\nPaimon: Wait... so the loser had to marry him!?",
            "About Dihua Marsh\tPaimon: Did you know the reeds in Dihua Marsh are common materials used in making paper?\nPaimon: The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes. It's all very sophisticated.\nPaimon: Over the years, many heroes and swordsmen have also chosen Dihua Marsh as the location of their duels.\nPaimon: The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep...\nPaimon: So there are a lot of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...\n{NICKNAME}: Huh. And what's my takeaway from all of this supposed to be?\nPaimon: Don't get into a fight in Dihua Marsh!",
            "About the Gentleman Bird\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that in Liyue, people call the crane the \"gentleman bird.\"\n{NICKNAME}: And do you know why that is?\nPaimon: Hmm... Paimon's not quite sure...\n{NICKNAME}: Well then, let me tell you about the story of the lucky crane repaying its debts.\n{NICKNAME}: A long, long time ago, there was a kind-hearted scholar who saved a lucky crane that had fallen into a trap.\n{NICKNAME}: Later, on a cold winter's night, a beautiful maiden came to his door, asking to lodge with him.\n{NICKNAME}: The maiden shouldered a greatsword on her back, and taught all that she knew of swordsmanship to the scholar, supervising him as he studied day and night.\nPaimon: Whoa...\n{NICKNAME}: Once he had finished his training, he went out into the wilds with the maiden to do good and fight for justice.\n{NICKNAME}: Ten years later, the lucky crane took the form of a gentleman, and finally came to return the favor, but discovered the couple had already lived out a fortuitous life...\n{NICKNAME}: And that's the story known as \"The Gentleman's 10-Year Debt.\"\nPaimon: Ahh...",
            "About Jueyun Karst\t{NICKNAME}: Rumor has it that Jueyun Karst is the abode of the adepti.\nPaimon: Wow — the abode of the adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps we'll meet the adepti on those cloud-piercing mountain peaks.\nPaimon: Wow — meeting adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: But I wonder... how would one normally communicate with the adepti?\nPaimon: Wow — communicating with adepti!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm. My emergency rations seem to be going bad. *sigh* Best to consume them quickly...\nPaimon: Ahem. Well... Paimon thinks that shouting from the mountaintop should work.\n{NICKNAME}: That seems more like a way for getting the attention of a hilichurl instead of an adeptus.",
            "About the God of Contracts\t{NICKNAME}: To think that the Geo Archon had signed a contract with the Cryo Archon.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder what the contents of their agreement were...\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't care who you are, making a deal with the Tsaritsa is super dangerous!\n{NICKNAME}: Be that as it may...\n{NICKNAME}: Since Morax is the god who understands the basis of contracts the best...\n{NICKNAME}: He's definitely given this some thought.\nPaimon: Well that's true. Morax himself called it the \"contract to end all contracts\"...\n{NICKNAME}: I trust that we will witness the truth, and its denouement, play out...",
            "About Divine Predictions in Liyue\tPaimon: Come to think of it, while Rex Lapis enjoys visiting his people in private, he only descends officially once every year.\nPaimon: None of the other gods do this. Hmm... Does Rex Lapis have any deeper intentions?\n{NICKNAME}: I have my guesses...\n{NICKNAME}: You see, those annual divine predictions have already captured the hearts of the people of Liyue too much.\n{NICKNAME}: Round and around they analyze and scrutinize every single word, finding limitless \"hidden meanings\" within them...\n{NICKNAME}: What do you think would happen to Liyue if such divine predictions were available every day?\nPaimon: Ah!\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now. Paimon would be offering Rex Lapis' favorite snacks to him every day!\nPaimon: If you could just get Mora straight from Morax's hands, who would ever need to do a day of honest work?\n{NICKNAME}: You made... some logical leaps, but that's basically how it is.",
            "About Benny's Adventure Team\tPaimon: If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared.\nPaimon: Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double- and triple-check your supplies in advance.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of 463 different ways of dying in these domains...\nPaimon: If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Why am I the only one dying here?\nPaimon: Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid 322 causes of death just by floating!\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains...",
            "About Bennett\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that Albert, being the leader of Barbara's fan club...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Sometimes gets bumps and bruises on purpose so that he can go to the Cathedral to see her.\nPaimon: Paimon feels the Knights of Favonius should keep a closer watch on weirdos like that.\n{NICKNAME}: But it seems that a month later, Albert discovered that Bennett was managing to see Barbara far more than he was.\n{NICKNAME}: On second thought, Bennett does have the natural advantage when it comes to getting injured.\nPaimon: What is this, a \"let's bother Barbara\" contest?",
            "About the \"Idol\"\tPaimon: Barbara's really popular, isn't she?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, she is the idol of the people of Mondstadt.\nPaimon: Come to think of it... Paimon doesn't really know what an \"idol\" is.\n{NICKNAME}: It's an occupation in which one's work is to be cute, be well-loved, and earn a boat-load of Mora.\nPaimon: Isn't that the same thing as being a mascot?\n{NICKNAME}: That's... one way to put it.",
            "About Being Sisters\t{NICKNAME}: Lisa and Amber feel a bit like sisters.\nPaimon: Huh? Why's that?\n{NICKNAME}: Amber often runs errands for Lisa. Older siblings asking their younger siblings to do things for them so they can slack off is a rather common practice...\n{NICKNAME}: But, my brother and I are the same age, so we had to decide these things via rock-paper-scissors.\nPaimon. Whoa. So, doesn't that make you my younger sister?\n{NICKNAME}: What do you mean?\nPaimon: Well, since Paimon floats, you're the only one who can \"run\" any errands!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Seriously?",
            "About Kaeya's Eye Patch\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, have you ever seen what Kaeya looks like under that eye patch?\nPaimon: Nope.\n{NICKNAME}: So, it would seem that he never takes it off...\nPaimon: Actually, Paimon already knows why!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh?\nPaimon: He must be hiding some big secret!\n{NICKNAME}: Really, a secret?\nPaimon: See, Kaeya heads out for assignments more than anyone else.\nPaimon: So the skin under that eye patch has to be way lighter than the rest of him.\n{NICKNAME}: So if he ever takes that eye patch off...\nPaimon: He'll definitely become the butt of everyone's jokes. Maybe he'll even get a weird nickname!\nPaimon: Like, say, \"Pasty Eye\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Guess he didn't need to take it off to get a weird nickname...",
            "About Kaeya and Diluc\tPaimon: Strange...\n{NICKNAME}: What's wrong?\nPaimon: Diluc and Kaeya are really alike, so why don't they get along?\n{NICKNAME}: How are they alike, again?\nPaimon: Well, Kaeya's the kind of guy who acts shady in the light of day...\nPaimon: While Diluc is a shining beacon of justice in the dark of night!\nPaimon: Don't you think that's kinda the same thing...?\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I still don't see it.",
            "About Measuring Fighting Strength\t{NICKNAME}: If one hilichurl could beat, say, three wild boars...\n{NICKNAME}: Then how many hilichurls would it take to reach the fighting prowess of Master Jean and Master Diluc?\nPaimon: Not sure... but if you heard the way everyone talks in Mondstadt, you'd know that Master Jean is the strongest.\n{NICKNAME}: I'd say that if Diluc strikes first, Master Jean wouldn't be able to counter.\nPaimon: Oh, she'd find a way.\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way.\nPaimon: Master Jean's Elemental Burst is really strong, you know~\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that \"field\" would also make Diluc stronger.\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't think Master Jean would even need her Vision to take on Master Diluc, because—\n{NICKNAME}: Diluc would only need a beginner's greatsword to—\nPaimon: Argh...\n{NICKNAME}: Ugh...\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* This... is so dumb.\n{NICKNAME}: They both fight for Mondstadt, so they wouldn't come to blows.\nPaimon: That's why Paimon likes your idea of measuring their fighting strength in number of hilichurls.\nPaimon: ...Or in Paimon's case, in fifths of a wild boar.",
            "About Razor\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you know what a brush is, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Of course! Kinda like pens but with animal hair at one end for calligraphy, right?\nPaimon: That's correct! They say that finely-made brushes sell for high prices among Liyue's merchants!\n{NICKNAME}: So, would you like to make some too?\nPaimon: Uh-huh! But wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!\nPaimon: Razor's fur is all downy and soft. It'll definitely make great wolf-fur brushes! We could make lots of Mora like this!\n{NICKNAME}: Brushes made like that would conduct electricity. I'm not sure we could use them.\n{NICKNAME}: Besides, Razor isn't a wolf, nor are wolf brushes made from actual wolves' fur...\nPaimon: Huh? Why are they called wolf-fur brushes, then?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?\nPaimon: Hmm. You have a point.",
            "About Klee\tPaimon: Klee's a really interesting kid.\nPaimon: All the Knights seem to like her a lot, too. You could even say they spoil her.\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder, who makes the better mascot: Paimon, or Klee?\n{NICKNAME}: Oh wait, I forgot. Paimon's not a mascot, Paimon is emergency—\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon knows exactly what you're going to say. That joke stopped being funny a long time ago.",
            "About the \"Wondermaid\"\tPaimon: It's time for Paimon's Little Life Tips!\n{NICKNAME}: \"Little Life Tips\"?\nPaimon: In Mondstadt, if there's something you can't fix, or there's something you can't get clean no matter what you do...\nPaimon: If you ever run into something you can't handle yourself, you just need to shout this name into the skies:\nPaimon: \"Noeeeelle!\"\nPaimon: And everything that's troubling you will be swept away in an instant.\n{NICKNAME}: So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt... Pretty impressive...",

It's not all that different.\n{NICKNAME}: Still, Oz can also translate for Fischl. You, on the other hand...\nPaimon: What!? Paimon's way better than some bird!\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, how so?\nPaimon: Well, um... uh... at least Paimon doesn't need wings to fly!",
            "About Pets\t{NICKNAME}: Speaking of Fischl, she also claims to be a \"visitor from another world\"...\n{NICKNAME}: We're similar in that way. We even bring a pet along with us.\nPaimon: Pet? Now, wait just a minute, here...\n{NICKNAME}: But her raven, Oz... He looks cool, and is polite to boot.\n{NICKNAME}: More importantly, he can both scout and fight — very useful indeed.\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe I should make arrangements with Fischl to trade companions once in a while for, say, a week or two at a time? Hehe, it should be quite interesting.\nPaimon: Hey! Doesn't Paimon get a say in this!?",
            "About Beidou\tPaimon: How do you become as popular and cool as Captain Beidou?\n{NICKNAME}: With enough experience...?\nPaimon: Paimon's already seen lots of things from adventuring together with you!\n{NICKNAME}: One also needs to experience trials and setbacks...\nPaimon: Paimon almost drowned that one time...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And maintain an inspirational disposition...\nPaimon: Uh-huh! Paimon's always rooted for you!\n{NICKNAME}: One must also have a... mature outlook towards problems.\nPaimon: Hey! Are you just trying to say that Paimon can't make it?",
            "About Ningguang\tPaimon: How does a person become as rich... no, as super rich as Lady Ningguang?\n{NICKNAME}: Hah... Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?\nPaimon: Well, there's the huge Jade Chamber, too! But isn't that also made of Mora?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you need an excellent mind...\nPaimon: Well... Paimon's really good at giving people nicknames!\n{NICKNAME}: You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets...\nPaimon: A serving of Fisherman's Toast goes for 1,025 Mora, and no discounts — even on rainy days.\n{NICKNAME}: You also need to be willing to work really hard...\nPaimon: Okay then... so, how do you make friends with a really rich person?\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, you're giving up already!?",
            "About Qiqi Being a Zombie\tPaimon: Umm... Do you think that Qiqi... needs to drink blood?\n{NICKNAME}: That's not a zombie, Paimon. That's a vampire.\nPaimon: Then, will she transform during a full moon?\n{NICKNAME}: Werewolves, Paimon. Not zombies.\nPaimon: Huh... As expected of a traveler, you really know a lot!\nPaimon: So, what special things can zombies do?\n{NICKNAME}: Exercises?\nPaimon: Ah, that makes a lot of sense! So, the ones that do exercises are zombies — got it!",
            "About Flying\tPaimon: Come on, {NICKNAME}, Paimon'll teach you how to fly!\nPaimon: Three, two, one!\n{NICKNAME}: Ah, Paimon's gone.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, whatever. *sigh* I'm tired. Let's just... sit here for a bit.\n{NICKNAME}: *yawn* I'm flying with you... in my heart... Mm...",
            "About Slimes\tPaimon: What sort of slime do you like the most, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Cryo Slimes, I think. You feel cold just getting close to them — you'll need that sort of thing in summer.\nPaimon: That's very practical, as expected of a traveler.\n{NICKNAME}: What about you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon likes them all! They're all very tasty!\n{NICKNAME}: Tasty, huh...\nPaimon: Turning slimes into bubbly, lovely, jubbly meals is the Paimon Special!\n{NICKNAME}: Well then...\n{NICKNAME}: I suppose that's one more thing I can eat before you become emergency rations, huh, Paimon?\nPaimon: Uhh... Paimon would rather not be on that list at all!",
            "About Hilichurls\t{NICKNAME}: Do you think that we're too harsh on the hilichurls?\nPaimon: Well... sometimes we really do seem like children who just can't resist kicking the hornet's nest...\n{NICKNAME}: I think we're doing more than just kicking it...",
            "About the Sleepers\t{NICKNAME}:  The \"Sleeper tribe\"... The hilichurls sure have interesting tribe names.\nPaimon: The Sleeper tribe will take any opportunity they can to take a nap.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that their animal-skin beds are really soft. Would you like to try them?\n{NICKNAME}: Not gonna try it yourself, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon can sleep while floating! The air is the softest bed. Pretty sweet, huh?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Just a little.",
            "About the Meaties\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Meaty tribe,\" huh? These hilichurls pick the funniest names.\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Meaty tribe make regular sacrifices. The altars they build are really huge.\n{NICKNAME}: What do they pray for?\nPaimon: \"For meat to eat every day\"! It's an awesome wish, isn't it?\n{NICKNAME}: ...I suppose I should have expected that answer.",
            "About the Eclipse Tribe\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Eclipse tribe\"... Huh. So the hilichurls have normal-sounding tribe names like these, too.\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Eclipse tribe are really mysterious.\nPaimon: All the hilichurls of that tribe can draw an eclipse symbol.\nPaimon: But rumor has it that only the Dada Samachurl of the Eclipse tribe knows why the eclipse symbol is so revered within their tribe.\n{NICKNAME}: An eclipse symbol...\nPaimon: Hmm? Did you say something, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Ah... I was... asking you what sort of soup you'd like to have tonight.\nPaimon: Can't stop thinking about food, huh? Seems like you'd be more at home in the Meaty tribe than the Eclipse tribe. But anyway, Paimon wants boar soup. Thanks!",
            "About Riches\tPaimon: Paimon doesn't feel so good...\n{NICKNAME}: What's the matter?\nPaimon: Paimon hasn't opened a treasure chest in so long. If this keeps up... *whimpers*\n{NICKNAME}: If this keeps up, you'll one day get caught in a hunting trap with a single Mora as bait...\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon floats, so that'll never work.",
            "About Weight Gain\tPaimon: Wow, we've really had a lot of good food recently, haven't we?\nPaimon: You know what they say: \"Have food, will travel\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Won't you be unable to fly if you get fat?\nPaimon: Nope! Paimon never gets fat!\n{NICKNAME}: Huh...\nPaimon: So Paimon demands more food!\n{NICKNAME}: Ever eating but never growing... Don't you fail as emergency rations, then?\nPaimon: Yeah, yeah... Well it sure doesn't look like you have any other candidates... So you'll have to make do with Paimon!",
            "About Cat People and Dog People\tPaimon: Which do you like more: cats or dogs?\n{NICKNAME}: I prefer Paimon.\nPaimon: Aww, that's cheating~!\nPaimon: Wait, no! Paimon's not a pet!",
            "About the Sound of the Ocean\tPaimon: People say that if you put a Starconch close to your ear, you can hear the whispers of the ocean!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you want to give it a go, Paimon?\nPaimon: No need, Paimon just heard it!\n{NICKNAME}: Really? And what did the ocean say?\nPaimon: The ocean said... that it's time to eat, so let's go! Paimon wants some Fisherman's Toast!",
            "About Rock, Paper, Scissors\tPaimon: We should get something tasty to eat! Uh, but Paimon doesn't wanna have to go get it...\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, shall we decide with a game of rock-paper-scissors, then?\nPaimon: Ooh, okay!\n{NICKNAME}: Great! Alright, ready? Rock, paper—\nPaimon: —Super Paimon Tornado!\n{NICKNAME}: ...What?",
            "About Relaxing\tPaimon: Phew! Paimon's been working so hard recently. Any ideas on how to relax?\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... Sleeping?\nPaimon: Sleeping's boring.\n{NICKNAME}: Reading?\nPaimon: Paimon'll get dizzy.\n{NICKNAME}: ...Okay, having a chat with some friends?\nPaimon: ...Ugh.\nPaimon: But those're all things that require thinking.\nPaimon: And not thinking is more relaxing.\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* And thus the \"Paimon Paradox,\" famed in the histories of philosophy in Teyvat, was put forth...",
            "About Dietary Differences\t{NICKNAME}: Liyue's cuisine is very different from that of Mondstadt.\n{NICKNAME}: For example, in Mondstadt you can hardly find spicy fried dishes anywhere.\nPaimon: That's why they say \"climate creates cuisine,\" ya know?\nPaimon: But wait... Why do all of Teyvat's slimes taste the same, then?\n{NICKNAME}: That's because you only know one way of cooking them...",
            "About Saving Money\tPaimon: Wow, a weasel thief's backpack can really hide a lot of Mora!\n{NICKNAME}: Well, it's because weasels, by nature, enjoy collecting shiny objects.\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the origin of the weasel thieves has something to do with the Treasure Hoarders...\nPaimon: Also, aren't crows the type to collect shinies as well?\nPaimon: Paimon wonders if Oz has a secret stash of Mora that he collects behind Fischl's back.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, now that you mention it, Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder, do you have—\nPaimon: —Uhh... Nope. Nothing here! You won't find any Mora in Paimon's shoes, no way!",
            "About Adventure Stories\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, have you ever read \"Vera's Melancholy\" before?\nPaimon: Well, it sure sounds familiar!\n{NICKNAME}: That book's pretty popular, and I've heard that the author made a tidy sum off of it...\nPaimon: *sigh* Paimon would love to make lots and lots of Mora...\nPaimon: Hmm... It's decided, then! Paimon will write an adventure story as well!\n{NICKNAME}: A tale of adventure, by Paimon?\nPaimon: Correct! It'll be a story in which the brave traveler defeats the dragon, saves the world...\nPaimon: And then sits down with her reliable companion for ten servings of Sticky Honey Roast!\n{NICKNAME}: ...Ten!?\nPaimon: Uh-huh! A happy ending attracts the readers, after all!\nPaimon: It's decided, then! We'll call it \"Paimon's Happiness!\"\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, what?",
            "About Nightmares\tPaimon: Have you ever had one of those super scary nightmares, {NICKNAME}?\n{NICKNAME}: Um, I've dreamt of falling through endless darkness...\n{NICKNAME}: Without a wind glider.\nPaimon: Eek...\n{NICKNAME}: I've also dreamt of my brother walking away from me, while I'm unable to catch up to him no matter how fast I run.\n{NICKNAME}: ...He tells me that I've \"come too late.\"\nPaimon: Oh...\nPaimon: Yours are quite different from the ones that Paimon's had.\nPaimon: Paimon's scariest dream was being eaten by a super giant slime.",
            "About Seelie\t{NICKNAME}: I wonder where those treasure-chasing Seelie come from.\nPaimon: Maybe they grow out of the ground — or maybe they fall from trees?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon doesn't know where they come from, but where there are Seelie, treasure's not far away!\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* Still... why do I feel a certain sadness every time they touch those treasures?\nPaimon: Hmm?\n{NICKNAME}: ...No, it's probably just my imagination.\nPaimon: Well... if you don't want the treasure, Paimon can hang onto it for you, free of charge!",
            "About Someone Unforgettable\tPaimon: Has anyone left a big impression on you during our recent travels?\nPaimon: For Paimon, that's Sara.\n{NICKNAME}: Timmie.\nPaimon: ...Huh? Why him?\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* His face comes to mind every time I've eaten a Sweet Madame recently... Really makes it hard to chow down.",
            "About Language\tPaimon: You learn new things so quickly.\nPaimon: You've already got such a good grasp of Teyvat's language.\n{NICKNAME}: You're a good teacher, Paimon.\nPaimon: Aww, hehehe...\n{NICKNAME}: Who knows, maybe the quality of your nasty nicknames will improve someday.",
            "About Paimon's Species\t{NICKNAME}: What monster made the deepest impression on you?\nPaimon: Monsters, huh? Probably... Ruin Guards.\n{NICKNAME}: Does a Ruin Guard really count as a monster? It's more like a machine...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that you can call anything that causes us trouble and needs to be defeated a \"monster.\"\nPaimon: Just like how we call anything that can be hunted \"prey.\"\n{NICKNAME}: Is that so... Well then, I think I'm finally able to classify you now, Paimon.\nPaimon: Eh? What do you mean?\n{NICKNAME}: You can be hooked and reeled in... therefore, you're a fish!\nPaimon: Hmph!",
            "About Storing Weapons\tPaimon: Hey, do that again! You know, that thing!\n{NICKNAME}: Which one?\nPaimon: The one where you make your weapon disappear with a swish, and then, fwoosh — you make it appear behind your back again!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, that. Haven't you seen that a ton already?\nPaimon: But Paimon hasn't figured out how you do it yet. Could you explain it?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, can you explain how you suddenly appear in front of me, and then disappear just as suddenly?\nPaimon: Uh... well... Paimon seems to have always been able to do this. But Paimon doesn't know how...\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. I believe that the art of putting my weapon away follows the same principle.\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe it's this similarity that makes us such good friends.",
            "About Chests\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, what do you think of treasure chests?\n{NICKNAME}: I believe that they were left behind by great travelers who once passed this way.\n{NICKNAME}: Every time I open one and look at its contents, I can feel a certain kinship with those who came before...\nPaimon: And that's how you get adventure experience!",
            "About Eyes\tPaimon: Look into Paimon's eyes!\n{NICKNAME}: Something the matter?\nPaimon: Kaeya said that people's eyes will betray them.\nPaimon: He can tell if someone is telling the truth or not just by looking into their eyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Huh...\nPaimon: Paimon loves Fisherman's Toast!\n{NICKNAME}: That should be the truth. Haha, well, that's also because you love everything that can be eaten.\nPaimon: Hehe.\n{NICKNAME}: Speaking of looking into people's eyes... I remember one gaze that left a particularly deep impression on me.\nPaimon: Whose gaze was that?\n{NICKNAME}: A Ruin Guard's. Really made me want to poke its eye out...",
            "About Imitating Others\tPaimon: Ugh, Paimon's so bored... So tired...\n{NICKNAME}: Well, since we're bored either way, wanna imitate the other Knights for fun?\nPaimon: Huh? Isn't that a bit disrespectful?\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, I see you already have the knightly virtue of modesty and politeness. Very impressive.\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon sees what you're doing. Cut it out!",
            "About the Luck of the Draw\tPaimon: Urrrrgh...\n{NICKNAME}: Huh? Are there pigeons around?\nPaimon: No, Paimon's just hungry.\nPaimon: What Paimon needs right now is a traveler who can whip up some delicious Sticky Honey Roast.\nPaimon: So, who's going to be the lucky traveler? Hmm?",

            "About the Vision Hunt Decree\tPaimon: It's hard to talk about the recent events in Inazuma and not mention the Vision Hunt Decree.\nPaimon: But you don't have a Vision, so you don't have to worry about losing one.\nPaimon: On the flip side, if you are caught by the Tenryou Commission, {NICKNAME}, you also can't surrender your Vision in exchange for your life...\n{NICKNAME}: I can tell them that you are my Vision.\nPaimon: Another reason to have Paimon around... Wait, WHAT!?\n{NICKNAME}: Don't worry, I wouldn't let them take you, Paimon.\nPaimon: That's more like it.\n{NICKNAME}: We'd just go to jail and suffer punishment together...\nPaimon: Uh...

            "About the Resistance\tPaimon: Only the ones who have the will to fight back are allowed into the Resistance!\nPaimon: Huh. In that case, Paimon also qualifies as a member.\n{NICKNAME}: And what exactly are you trying to resist, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon has been resisting against the fate of being squished all this time!\n{NICKNAME}: Then you probably won't get in.\nPaimon: Why? Is it because Paimon isn't fighting for the same cause as the Resistance?\n{NICKNAME}: It's because you're fighting for a lost cause, I'm afraid...\nPaimon: *sob* Y—You meanie!",

What a mouthful.\n{NICKNAME}: What are you reading, Paimon?\nPaimon: Look, it's the super weapon the Shogunate army has constructed nearby to protect Tatarasuna.\nPaimon:  Kamuijima! Cannon!\n{NICKNAME}: It looks really powerful... And yet, we didn't see it do anything while we were in Tatarasuna.\nPaimon: It seems like the Resistance knew how strong it was, so before formally waging war against the Shogunate, they had covertly occupied this place.\nPaimon: But this Kamui... Kamuijima Cannon needs either special ammunition or Electro to work, so it's no use to the Resistance.\nPaimon: The Shogunate army put so much time and effort into creating this weapon... Paimon really wants to see the extent of its power.\n{NICKNAME}: If all you need is an Electro user, perhaps I can help.\nPaimon: That's right!

When we first arrived at the Komore Teahouse, Paimon really thought that Taroumaru would be able to speak...\n{NICKNAME}: You sound a bit disappointed.\nPaimon: Of course!

Paimon just thought of another one. This one's quite good—\nPaimon: \"Just look at this visitor! Paimon, is it? Look at how cute and clever she is. Today, all her meals are on the house! *woof*\"\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way Taroumaru would say something like that.\nPaimon: Hee-hee...",

Oh, I found something!\nPaimon: Really? Aw, {NICKNAME}, Paimon always knew you were reliable!\n{NICKNAME}: Ta-da!

Wow!\n{NICKNAME}: If that's the case, then perhaps you can submit a draft of the book you've been working on, \"Paimon's Happiness.\"\nPaimon: Well, about that... Paimon has misplaced the drafts on our way to Inazuma...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Really?\nPaimon: Fine! Paimon hasn't started writing it yet...\nPaimon: It's not Paimon's fault!

Paimon's hungry!\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, it sounds like you'll sooner write \"A Thousand Excuses with Paimon\" than \"Paimon's Happiness.\"",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tPaimon: Kazuha is a free spirit, wouldn't you say?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, he seems to be a bit of a loner too.\nPaimon: Being able to explore the world at his leisure while savoring the beauty of everything around him. That doesn't sound too shabby...\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you aren't thinking of sneaking off to go on a solo adventure, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Aw, I would never leave you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Paimon's really happy to hear that.

            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tPaimon: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon, you look so serious today.\nPaimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.\nPaimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families. They have an endless supply of Mora and mountains of delicious food to eat...\n{NICKNAME}: I can't disagree. Those are exactly the things you're fond of.\nPaimon: But after getting to know Ayaka better, Paimon realized that a young lady from a noble family can also have her share of hardships.\nPaimon: She needs to shoulder her clan's duties and responsibilities. She works so hard and has very little time for herself.\nPaimon: Ayaka must be exhausted, she should try to relax a bit...\nPaimon: Ah, that's right! Let's invite Ayaka to the next festival!\nPaimon: If she got an invite from us, there's no way she'd refuse.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, I'd like to go to another festival with her.\nPaimon: Besides, if Ayaka's around, she can pick up the tab for us...\n{NICKNAME}: ...I should've seen that coming...",

            "About Festival Traditions\tPaimon: It's a well-established tradition that during Inazuman celebrations everyone's wearing festive masks.\nPaimon: Paimon tried to look around the stalls, but hasn't found any mask that fits...\n{NICKNAME}: So you really want a mask of your own?\nPaimon: Of course! Not wearing a mask during an Inazuman festival is the same as not receiving a bouquet at the Windblume Festival...\n{NICKNAME}: Let me make one for you.\nPaimon: Whoa! {NICKNAME}, you're the best!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm, I wonder what kind of mask will fit you best? How about... a slime mask?\nPaimon: Yay, Paimon Slime!",
            "About Yoimiya\tPaimon: Do you think Yoimiya's dad's poor hearing is related to fireworks?\nPaimon: He's been making and testing fireworks for many years now, and being exposed to the sound of gunpowder explosions on a daily basis... Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...\nPaimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?\nPaimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?\nPaimon: Uh... Um...\nPaimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...\n{NICKNAME}: Then you'd need to leave me.\nPaimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!\nPaimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...\n{NICKNAME}: Actually, she can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind, but I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.\nPaimon: Eh?

We're almost out of Mora. I guess we'll have to tighten the purse strings for the next few days...\nPaimon: Wh-What? Noooo!\n{NICKNAME}: See, you're not as carefree as you thought.\nPaimon: Ooh...

            "About Onikabuto\tPaimon: Those Onikabuto bugs look so scary! The patterns on their backs are terrifying!\n{NICKNAME}: Do you mean those demonic patterns? It's because they don't like to fight, so they purposely evolved their patterns in a way that scares their enemies away.\nPaimon: That's really smart. We should try to learn a thing or two from them!\nPaimon: We could borrow Xiao's mask. If a hilichurl saw you wearing it, do you think they'd run in fear?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I don't think Xiao would agree to that...\nPaimon: Yeah... Hmm, how about we ask Sayu to steal his mask for us?\nPaimon: She knows ninjutsu that allows her to vanish into thin air. She can steal it for sure! Problem solved!\nPaimon: Uh... If we are afraid of Xiao evening the score with us, how about we steal Childe's mask? We've kicked his butt many times before!\n{NICKNAME}: I don't think stealing other people's belongings is a good idea. Also, what if Sayu doesn't agree to all of this?\nPaimon: Th—Then let's... Let's visit Albedo first.\nPaimon: If Albedo can develop a growth serum for Sayu, she'll help us for sure!\n{NICKNAME}: Brilliant, now we just need you to come up with a way to make Albedo help us.\nPaimon: Ugh! Paimon's head is going to explode. Let's stick to festival masks for now.",
            "About Naku Weed\tPaimon: Even though Naku Weed has a flower-like structure, its \"petals\" are in fact leaves.\nPaimon: Its actual bloom is rather fragile, so the surrounding leaves try their hardest to grow strong and protect it...\nPaimon: Hee-hee, just like Paimon is protecting you right now.\n{NICKNAME}: Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?\nPaimon: Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?",
            "About Naku Weed and Storms\tPaimon: Did you know? The people in Inazuma use the vibrations of Naku Weed to forecast thunderstorms.\nPaimon: Because Naku Weed grows in areas that are infused with Electro, it's naturally drawn to thunder and lightning.\n{NICKNAME}: Does that mean Naku Weed is similar to you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Eh? How so?\n{NICKNAME}: You know, because you usually hang out in areas infused with gourmet food and are naturally drawn to tasty snacks!\nPaimon: Hee-hee, that's true!\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon radar activated...\nPaimon: *beep* Delicacies, here we go!",
            "About Sakura Blooms\tPaimon: The blossoms drifting down from the Sacred Sakura are so dazzling!\nPaimon: Paimon heard that those flower petals can stay suspended in the air for so long because of being infused with Electro.\n{NICKNAME}: Is it the same principle behind your levitation abilities?\nPaimon: Uh... Ah... That's because...\n{NICKNAME}: You do know what allows you to fly, don't you, Paimon?\nPaimon: Paimon can fly because of... mysterious powers, obviously!\n{NICKNAME}: Got it. Seems like you have no idea.\n{NICKNAME}: How about we let Albedo do some research? He's good at cracking such mysteries...\nPaimon: Please don't!",
            "About Lavender Melons\tPaimon: Lavender Melons sure are useful!\nPaimon: Their flesh can be eaten, and their skin can be processed to make dyes.\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon sure is useful!\n{NICKNAME}: She can serve as my guide, and she can also give other people ugly nicknames, haha.\nPaimon: Yep! Thank you for your validation!\nPaimon: Wait a minute, is there more? Is Paimon about to get roasted?\nPaimon: Paimon's gonna cover your mouth to stop you from talking!",
            "About Swords\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, have you noticed?\nPaimon: In Inazuma, people who wear swords on their waists are a minority. Most soldiers use spears.\nPaimon: Could it be that swords are a symbol of status... Should we wear them as well?\nPaimon: But the swords here are all too big for Paimon... There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!\n{NICKNAME}: A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.\nPaimon: Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.\nPaimon: Really? Really? Let's have a look!\nPaimon: Hey! Isn't that the knife we use to cut fruit?\n{NICKNAME}: Well, at least it's the right size for you...\n{NICKNAME}: Ahem, \"What matters isn't the value of the sword, it's the fighting spirit.\"\nPaimon: Nice try, but Paimon won't fall for this, no matter how cool it sounds!",
            "About Hot Springs\tPaimon: Did you know there are hot springs in Inazuma?\n{NICKNAME}: ...But there are no volcanoes.\nPaimon: Umm, Paimon heard that the heat comes from a giant furnace!\nPaimon: If we get the chance, Paimon also wants to check out a hot spring. Unfortunately, it seems like only the big shots are granted entry.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\n{NICKNAME}: Let's head back to the Dadaupa Gorge in Mondstadt!\nPaimon: Eh? Why so sudden?\n{NICKNAME}: Back in the Dadaupa Gorge, the hilichurls have a huge cauldron that's heated by Flaming Flowers. It should be similar to a hot spring, right? You can bathe in their... soup, I guess?\nPaimon: ???",
            "About Jugemu\tPaimon: In Inazuma, it's customary for parents to choose a lucky name for their child.\n{NICKNAME}: Those names symbolize everyone's expectations and wishes for the child, like prosperity, wealth, good health, and safety.\nPaimon: Because of these expectations, parents often pick extra long names, and cram all sorts of blessings into them.\n{NICKNAME}: So hypothetically, if one day a little girl fell into a lake on her way back home, then her friends might rush to her house to tell everyone, \"Something bad happened!\"\nPaimon: \"Oh, what happened?\"\n{NICKNAME}: Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, Prinzessin der Verurteilung Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, come quick! Centennial Genius Astrologist Mona Megistus has fallen into the water!\nPaimon: ...Mona falling into the water doesn't sound like an emergency situation though.\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. The fast-swimming Mona would come back home around the same time her friends are done saying her name, haha.",
            "About Inazuma's Islands\tPaimon: Inazuma's scenery is quite different than what we've seen so far.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, Inazuma's an island nation.\nPaimon: Before the invention of boats, how did the people living on different islands communicate with one another?\n{NICKNAME}: According to Yoimiya's dad, they probably used smoke signals to transmit information.\n{NICKNAME}: Or, they would...\nPaimon: Yeah...?\n{NICKNAME}: They would commission people who could freeze the water surface to travel between the islands and deliver messages.\nPaimon: Whoa! If Kaeya had lived in Inazuma back then, he would've been even busier than Master Jean now!",
            "About Tanuki\tPaimon: Tanuki are really mysterious creatures.\n{NICKNAME}: I think they are really cute.\nPaimon: Yeah, they're cute... until they start talking.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, I wonder... If you couldn't talk, would you appear to be more mysterious and noble?\nPaimon: Are you trying to mock me?\n{NICKNAME}: *randomly humming innocently*",
            "About Tanuki and Their Illusions\tPaimon: Did anyone tell you that there are monsters called tanuki in Inazuma that can take on the form of any human they see?\n{NICKNAME}: I heard such rumors before. They must know some mysterious transformation techniques.\nPaimon: What if one day a tanuki tricked you by transforming into Paimon? Oh no... Paimon's worried now! \n{NICKNAME}: No worries, I'd surely be able to tell the difference— Wait! You're just concerned about my Mora, aren't you?\nPaimon: Of course... Ah! ...No, no! Paimon's only concerned about your safety, {NICKNAME}!\nPaimon: Hmph, stop looking at Paimon like that. *pouting* Look, just think about it! If there were two Paimons, how would you find out which one is the real one?\n{NICKNAME}: ...Eh-he.\nPaimon: What do you mean \"eh-he\"!?\n{NICKNAME}: See, only the real Paimon would respond like that.\nPaimon: Ah! Paimon got tricked again...",
            "About Other Shrines\tPaimon: We've been passing by a lot of small shrines lately, but none of them seem to be dedicated to the Electro Archon.\n{NICKNAME}: They were probably built for lesser deities. The people of Inazuma believe that everything around them has a spirit, and those spirits will help them in their time of need.\nPaimon: Oh, so the people make shrines for them, and give them offerings.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. In a way, it's a form of prayer and a token of appreciation.\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now! Let's find Ayaka, and have her put up a shrine for us!\nPaimon: If we do that, we'll be able to get lots of offerings as well!\nPaimon: Paimon's so happy!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I—Is that an acceptable thing to do?\nPaimon: What's wrong? Haven't we been helping out everyone this whole time? We may be doing an even better job than those deities!\n{NICKNAME}: You do have a point...\n{NICKNAME}: But when I picture people placing flowers or fruits in front of a shrine for me... it doesn't feel right.",
            "About the Rain on Yashiori Island\t{NICKNAME}: It never stops raining on Yashiori Island. I heard it's because of the lingering evil energy.\nPaimon: \"Evil energy\"? What's that? Sounds terrifying.\n{NICKNAME}: It's caused by the remains of an evil god somewhere on the island. Because its power hasn't fully dispersed, the remaining energy causes all sorts of misfortunes. That's what I meant when I said \"evil energy.\"\nPaimon: Oh, that makes sense. But Paimon doesn't think rain is a bad thing.\nPaimon: Maybe that god has been crying all this time because they were bullied.\n{NICKNAME}: Crying? I don't think gods can cry. I mean, I've never seen Venti or Zhongli cry before.\nPaimon: There are exceptions! If you pinch Paimon, you'll be able to see a crying god.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? Are you a god?\nPaimon: Paimon sure is!\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, let me guess... The flying god of silly questions? The god of slimes? Or the god of being fished out from the water?\nPaimon: Paimon's none of those! Hmph!\nPaimon: As your bodyguard, {NICKNAME}, Paimon is the god of protection! Hehe.",
            "About Bantan Sango Detective Agency\t{NICKNAME}: In Hanamizaka, there's a place called the Bantan Sango Detective Agency.\nPaimon: Paimon remembers. It's the one run by Sango and Ryuuji, right? Everyone speaks highly of them.\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, I heard that they frequently get caught up in strange incidents, and some places have banned them from entering their premises...\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that's undeserved. After all, Sango and Ryuuji have helped a lot of people...\n{NICKNAME}: Would you invite them if you were organizing a dinner party?\n{NICKNAME}: What if halfway through the meal, one of the guests suddenly shrieked and collapsed onto the ground...\nPaimon: I—If that's the case, then Paimon thinks it's a bad idea. Paimon suddenly feels that hanging out with them could be dangerous...\n{NICKNAME}: Well, that's the price you pay for being a famous detective.",
            "About Drawing Fortune Slips\tPaimon: Oh yeah, have you drawn fortune slips at the shrine before, {NICKNAME}?\nPaimon: If we draw them before our next adventure, they may provide us with some guidance.\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, but what if our draws are inauspicious or turn out to be a bad omen? If that happened, we'd probably end up in a bad mood...\nPaimon: Oh, that's fine. According to the shrine maidens, if someone draws a bad omen, they just need to hang it on a tree in the shrine...\nPaimon: So, we should keep on drawing and drawing, until we get a super lucky draw! Then, we'll hang all the bad ones on the tree!\n{NICKNAME}: If everyone did that, there'd be no more space left to hang the slips...",
            "About Musou no Hitotachi\tPaimon: Musou no Hitotachi is amazing!\nPaimon: It can beat any enemy with a single slash!\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, but for Childe, it might need three slashes...\nPaimon: Y—Yeah!\nPaimon: Anyway, if you mastered that technique, Paimon wouldn't have to worry about you for the rest of our journey!\n{NICKNAME}: So, where can one learn that technique?\nPaimon: Yeah, where can one learn that technique?\n{NICKNAME}: Hm?\nPaimon: Quit looking at Paimon like that! O—Okay, Paimon will keep an eye on you during our adventures...",
            "About Sangonomiya Kokomi\tPaimon: Did you know, {NICKNAME}? That Sangonomiya Kokomi, she's Watatsumi Island's Divine Priestess.\nPaimon: In other words, she's the ruler of Watatsumi Island! The whole of Watatsumi Island is controlled by her.\nPaimon: Paimon also wants to become a big shot like her...\n{NICKNAME}: What will you do after you become a big shot?\nPaimon: Then, Paimon will deliver justice. For example... Ahem.\nPaimon: The suspect in question, known as the Traveler, ate two Dango for lunch and only gave one to the victim, Paimon. This is a serious violation of article thirty seven, \"Fairness and Justice,\" of the \"Paimon Decree.\"\n{NICKNAME}: Oh... may I ask how Your Excellency Paimon plans to resolve this issue?\nPaimon: Of course. As compensation for your wrongdoings, you will have to make even more Dango for Paimon, hee-hee!",
            "About Transience\tPaimon: Paimon wonders what the previous Shogun was like.\n{NICKNAME}: It appears that she was a person who understood the fleeting nature of things, and accepted the inevitable fate of departing this world one day.\nPaimon: After all, realizing the fragility of things in front of you makes you treasure them even more.\n{NICKNAME}: This way of thinking must've influenced Inazuma's aesthetics. This world is transient, people come and go. The fun times we shared, our companionship, and the delicious foods we got to savor — those emotions and experiences are real things that existed at some point in time, not just empty concepts.\nPaimon: Even though... Even though every banquet must eventually come to an end, it'd be nice to enjoy those happy moments for a little longer.\n{NICKNAME}: \"Shifting seasons and elusive dreams, the ephemeral and fleeting, with thine companionship, all are eternal.\"\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't get it!\n{NICKNAME}: I'm saying that I'm having a lot of fun traveling with you, Paimon. It'd be nice if we could just go on like this forever.\nPaimon: Paimon'll take your word for it then.",
            "About Shrine Maidens\tPaimon: The clothes that shrine maidens wear are quite unique.\n{NICKNAME}: I heard that after the Sakoku Decree is lifted, Yae Miko plans to run a rental service where people can try on shrine maiden outfits as a tourist attraction in various places. Combined with the latest Kamera technology from Fontaine, it seems like a real Mora maker.\nPaimon: Oh!\n{NICKNAME}: {MThe shrine maidens in the Grand Shrine even asked me if I knew any pretty girls who are willing to become models. All they need to do is to dress up in a shrine maiden outfit and smile to the Kamera. They even asked me to be a model and said all I needed was some makeup.}{FThe shrine maidens in the Grand Shrine even asked me if I was interested in becoming a model! All I need to do is wear a shrine maiden outfit and smile to the Kamera. They also asked me if I knew any other cute girls.}\nPaimon: What!?\n{NICKNAME}: I immediately shared this idea with Rosaria. I feel like they can do something similar at the Church of Favonius with the garments they wear.\nPaimon: Wait, Paimon doesn't think that a...\n{NICKNAME}: Sadly, Rosaria found the idea of it too troublesome.\nPaimon: Maybe it's for the better...",
            "About the Artist Utamarou\tPaimon: Aoi gave Paimon a painting. Turns out it's not edible, but Paimon is still very happy with that gift!\n{NICKNAME}: Aoi? The general goods shop owner? Let me see.\nPaimon: Here, but be careful. It was painted by a famous artist, Utamarou. It's quite valuable!\n{NICKNAME}: Utamarou? Hmm... I think I've heard that name before...\nPaimon: Of course, master Utamarou's works can be found all around Inazuma after all!\nPaimon: Did you see one of them in Ayaka's residence? The one that Paimon has right now isn't too shabby either.\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, I remember now! One of those paintings was used by Yoimiya as kindling, right?\nPaimon: Eh? Kindling?\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, yeah! I think Thoma used it as padding for table legs as well.\nPaimon: What? Padding?\n{NICKNAME}: And, if I remember correctly, I also saw Sayu use a stack of those paintings as a cushion for her nap.\nPaimon: Sayu has several of those works? That can't be right...\n{NICKNAME}: Real masterpieces aren't mass-produced. If you ask me, that Utamarou isn't a real master at all.\nPaimon: Hey—",
            "About the Teahouse and Its Owner\tPaimon: The Komore Teahouse is doing surprisingly well. They have a great number of visitors every day.\nPaimon: We should also open a teahouse. Paimon feels that it'd be really profitable!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Well, if we do end up opening a teahouse, then you're gonna be the boss, for sure.\nPaimon: Eh? Deal!\nPaimon: Paimon didn't think that you'd have so much faith in Paimon's abilities... Paimon will make sure to be a responsible manager, and make our shop the best teahouse in Teyvat!\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh, I don't think it'd need to be managed... Do you remember Taroumaru?\nPaimon: Yup, he's the owner of the Komore Teahouse, right? A lot of the clients go to the Teahouse to play with him rather than drink tea.\n{NICKNAME}: So I was thinking, if you were running the shop, you'd definitely be more popular than Taroumaru.\nPaimon: Hee-hee, of course... Hey! So you don't really trust Paimon's management skills, you just want a mascot!?",
            "About the Sakoku Decree\t{NICKNAME}: With the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, I guess the Sakoku Decree will be the next one to go.\nPaimon: Here's hoping that everything goes well.\n{NICKNAME}: Let's encourage everyone to hold on for just a bit longer.\nPaimon: Yeah!\n{NICKNAME}: If we get the chance, let's find Atsuko and tell her that the sakura trees in her homeland are blooming.\nPaimon: How is that supposed to comfort her!?",
            "About Kimonos\tPaimon: *sigh* Ogura Mio says that she hardly has any fancy kimonos in stock these days. So, chances are that you won't be able to buy one, even if you can afford it.\nPaimon: It's a real tragedy... Paimon wants to look glamorous, too.\n{NICKNAME}: But the Sakoku Decree's been abolished... She should be able to import silk from Liyue now.\nPaimon: *gasp* You're right! Great, so there's hope for Paimon's kimono-dream after all!\nPaimon: Just imagine it... Paimon emerges from Ogura's shop wearing a custom-made pure-silk one-of-a-kind kimono. Total transformation! This Paimon's going places!\nPaimon: No longer just a sidekick in the legendary Traveler's adventure story... Oh no, say hello to Paimon the Elegant, wearer of fine silks and fated friend of heroes!\nPaimon: Ahhh... Wouldn't that be amazing?\nPaimon: ...It would, wouldn't it, {NICKNAME}? Um, so—\n{NICKNAME}: What I'm hearing is... you want me to pay for your new wardrobe.\nPaimon: Exactly, you read Paimon's mind! See, that's what being \"fated friends\" is all about!\nPaimon: Um, so Paimon was thinking seven different styles, one for each day of the week. Still not sure on the specific designs though, let Paimon think...\n{NICKNAME}: ...Uh, suddenly, I'm not so interested in buying.",
            "About Canned Knowledge\tPaimon: Free knowledge without having to study at all? Canned Knowledge is amazing!\nPaimon: Could Sumeru have Canned Knowledge about the different customs of the seven nations, too?\nPaimon: If so, Paimon could just open a can every time we get to a new place. Paimon wouldn't have to explain things ever again!\n{NICKNAME}: Or we could just open them all here in Sumeru.\nPaimon: But... but traveling wouldn't be any fun without surprises to look forward to!\n{NICKNAME}: Plus, if we opened them all here, I wouldn't even need Paimon as a guide anymore.\nPaimon: Okay scrap that idea! No more Canned Knowledge. Let's save our Mora for something else!\nPaimon: Something like... Oh! tipping Paimon for guide services! Heehee, seems fair, right?",
            "About The Eremites\tPaimon: The Eremites are a real motley crew...\n{NICKNAME}: There's certainly a diverse range of characters.\nPaimon: Hmmm... yeah, that could explain it! Paimon can play lots of different characters too.\nPaimon: Judgy Paimon, knowledgeable Paimon, helpful Paimon...\n{NICKNAME}: ...And of course the classic, completely-misses-the-point Paimon.",
            "About Beliefs\tPaimon: Have you noticed something? People in Sumeru don't seem to have a lot of faith in Lesser Lord Kusanali.\nPaimon: Back in Liyue and Inazuma, people were pretty enthusiastic about Rex Lapis and the Almighty Shogun.\nPaimon: Those strange scholars are one thing, but even everyone living downtown only ever seems to talk about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, that's true... Even the most delicious mushrooms are said to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's blessing.\nPaimon: Speaking of which, lots of the dishes in Liyue are said to have been taught and approved by Rex Lapis himself...\nPaimon: Aha! So as long as a god blesses their people with delicious food, people will worship them!\n{NICKNAME}: If their name is Paimon, sure.\nPaimon: Huh? Wait, so... {NICKNAME}, what do you believe in, then?\n{NICKNAME}: Me? Hehe... Paimon, of course.\nPaimon: Heehee, that's right!",

Also, why do I have to climb it, exactly?\nPaimon: Uh... because it's right there?\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, even so... No.\nPaimon: The Wall of Samiel is right there in front of us!\n{NICKNAME}: I know, I know, but it's way too—\nPaimon: But it's the Wall of Samiel...\n{NICKNAME}: Fine! I'll go, okay?",
            "About Akasha Terminals\tPaimon: All these Sumeru scholars seem to wear Akasha Terminals so they can get information from the Akasha system.\nPaimon: It's like they're carrying an interactive encyclopedia with them wherever they go. Paimon's kinda jealous.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm not jealous. I have an even better encyclopedia that automatically follows me around, gives me the A-to-Z on everything in Teyvat, and the best part is, it can even talk!\nPaimon: Huh? Was that a compliment? Aw, you're making Paimon blush... Paimon definitely doesn't know as much as an encyclopedia! A-to-Y at most.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you know... maybe if you ate a little less, you'd have room for Z, too.\nPaimon: Hey!!!",

Whew, Aranara names are so hard to remember...\nPaimon: The only bit Paimon's sure of is that they all start with \"Ara\"!\n{NICKNAME}: Right, so if you were an Aranara, your name would be \"Arapaimon.\"\nPaimon: Yup, and as for {NICKNAME}...\nPaimon: Hmm, actually, they'd probably call you Nara {NICKNAME}...\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, we're all Nara to them...\nPaimon: So if there was someone whose actual name was \"Nara,\" what would the Aranara call them?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Nara Nara\"... I guess. Sounds kinda cute.\nPaimon: Hehe, yeah.",

Still, those mushrooms and fruits were so raw, it felt like they were gonna keep growing in Paimon's stomach!\n{NICKNAME}: Heh, you're exaggerating, right? You do have a point, though — maybe the best ingredients don't need a lot of fancy cooking.\nPaimon: You're right. If the ingredients are good enough, they'll taste great even when cooked with the simplest methods.\n{NICKNAME}: Just like Paimon. Just a little salt and pepper, and—\nPaimon: Hey! For crying out loud, we're in Sumeru now! Don't you think that joke's getting a little old?",

Didst thou summon me, O Traveler from a distant land?\nPaimon: Come on, come on, now you have to grant Paimon three wishes!

Eating the street food on every corner has never sounded so tempting!\n{NICKNAME}: Your stomach is gonna punish you for that!\nPaimon: If so, Paimon'll go see a doctor and get treated — it's all for free! It'd be a waste not to take advantage of this, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe... But then again, the treatment would likely include a restricted diet.\nPaimon: *gasp* Oh no! So no more delicious food, then?\n{NICKNAME}: That, plus the doctor would make you take the most bitter-tasting medicine ever.\nPaimon: O—Okay... Maybe Paimon needs to reconsider this idea...",
            "About the Scholars\tPaimon: So many people in Sumeru want to become scholars.\nPaimon: Motivated by this ambition, they all study really hard to try and achieve it...\nPaimon: But Paimon bets that the first ever scholar didn't set out to become a scholar...\nPaimon: Hmm... so what do you think the first ever scholar's ambition was?\n{NICKNAME}: Probably... to get their research paper written as quickly as possible.\nPaimon: Huh? But isn't a scholar's ultimate goal supposed to be \"pursuing the highest and greatest knowledge\" or something?\nPaimon: Paimon's sure that it must have been because of a fervent desire for knowledge that they became Sumeru's first true scholar.\n{NICKNAME}: Writing papers is how you pursue knowledge.\nPaimon: But what about when it's the highest and greatest knowledge of all...\n{NICKNAME}: Even then, if you wanted to prove it, you'd need a research paper.\n{NICKNAME}: And after that, you'd need to start working on another paper to validate your original thesis...\nPaimon: O—Okay, Paimon's got it! Come on, don't look so sad! It's not like you have to worry about writing papers yourself!\nPaimon: ...Y—You've never had to write a paper before, right...?",

Paimon genuinely thinks that it's a really meaningful research topic and wants to help out!\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, well in that case... I think the Amurta scholars might be more interested to find out about Paimon's species and behavioral patterns.\nPaimon: Uh... Gee is that the time?

Paimon likes how the people who keep them give them each a special name based on their most distinctive traits!\n{NICKNAME}: For all we know, the Sumpter Beasts might be giving each of us a name in return. Maybe that's how they respond when we call their name.\nPaimon: Really? So what kind of name do think they'd give us?\n{NICKNAME}: (Sumpter Beast noises)\nPaimon: How is anyone supposed to understand that!\n{NICKNAME}: A rough translation would be...\n{NICKNAME}: \"Vociferous Pestiferous Melliculus Niveous Micro-Bipedal.\"\n{NICKNAME}: That's the scientific name, of course.\nPaimon: Oh? What would the common name be then?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Noisy Two-Legged Critter\"\nPaimon: Hey! Why keep only the negative traits?",
            "About the Seventh Darshan\tPaimon: There are six Darshans in Sumeru.\nPaimon: It would be cool if Paimon had her own Darshan too!\nPaimon: It'll be called... Paimonology!\n{NICKNAME}: And... what wisdom would Paimonology stand for?\nPaimon: Uh... practical wisdom for everyday life!\n{NICKNAME}: So Paimonology scholars would specialize in the art of cooking slimes in a hundred different ways, and never letting a single Mora escape their grasp, and giving people ugly nicknames... et cetera, et cetera?\nPaimon: Whoa, you read Paimon's mind! Also, don't forget \"How to Become the Best Travel Guide in Teyvat\"!\nPaimon: This is a fantastic idea! Come on, let's go submit a Darshan application to the Akademiya! From this day on, {NICKNAME}'ll be the Grand Sage of Paimonology!\n{NICKNAME}: I'd like to decline the honor, please...",
            "About Shroomboars\tPaimon: Did you know that there are all kinds of strange Shroom-Kin in Sumeru?\n{NICKNAME}: Yup. Here's a fun one — legend has it that there were some forest boars who couldn't live without mushrooms, and the two species gradually formed a symbiotic relationship with each other. Now they're known as \"Shroomboars.\"\nPaimon: Woah, that's a lot like us! Paimon can't live without {NICKNAME} either.\n{NICKNAME}: If you can't live without me, that means... I'm the shroom, and Paimon's the...\nPaimon: Boar!\nPaimon: Hey, wait a second...",
            "About the Grand Bazaar\tPaimon: The residents of the Grand Bazaar are all so talented!\nPaimon: They sell their own woven goods, beautiful vases and jars, and delicious-smelling spices that make Paimon's tummy start rumbling...\nPaimon: And they all sing and dance really well! Paimon wishes she could do that.\n{NICKNAME}: Well, if you're serious about it, there's no reason you couldn't learn.\nPaimon: What? Really?\n{NICKNAME}: Well for starters, you have a natural advantage when it comes to dancing.\n{NICKNAME}: You won't trip over yourself, or accidentally step on someone's foot...\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon always forgets how useful flying can be!\nPaimon: Alright then! Let's go bust a move at the Grand Bazaar and watch everyone shower Paimon with admiration!\n{NICKNAME}: Aha, so that's what this is all about.",
            "About Divination\tPaimon: People in Sumeru seem to take divination and fortune-telling pretty seriously.\nPaimon: For starters, there's astrology, although only the scholars get to practice that. But ordinary citizens have their ways, too. They can do divinations with just a cup of coffee!\n{NICKNAME}: It's the nation of wisdom after all. It seems like people have an insatiable curiosity to learn about everything, including their own future.\nPaimon: Paimon heard that they can tell your fate just by looking at the bottom of a finished cup of coffee...\nPaimon: Sounds way easier than climbing to the top of a tower and staring at the stars all night!\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, so you're interested in learning your fate now?\nPaimon: Yeah... although, Paimon's really more interested in finding out what the coffee tastes like.",
            "About Purbiruni and Pursina\tPaimon: Khedive and Anisa kept talking about \"Purbiruni\" this and \"Pursina\" that...\nPaimon: Why do all these words have \"pur\" at the front?\n{NICKNAME}: \"Pur\" means \"descendant,\" and also \"student\"... So in this case, they're referring to themselves as the children and students of the great sages of old.\nPaimon: Huh, so that's what it means... From the way they were throwing these words around, Paimon was sure it'd be something to be proud of.\n{NICKNAME}: Wait... But isn't it?\nPaimon: Well, Paimon for one would much rather be known as the founding father than have a name that basically says \"So-and-so's my daddy.\" Pretty embarrassing, don't you think?\n{NICKNAME}: Um... Yeah, I have to admit, I've never thought about it like that...",
            "About Studying Abroad\tPaimon: It's not only Sumeru locals at the Akademiya, huh. There are students from other nations too.\nPaimon: Imagine leaving your hometown behind and traveling to a faraway and unfamiliar land in the pursuit of learning... How inspiring!\n{NICKNAME}: We travel to unfamiliar lands pretty often, too.\nPaimon: Huh, you're right! That means we're also super inspiring!\n{NICKNAME}: Not in the pursuit of learning, though.\nPaimon: Oh... So we're not as inspiring as the students after all...\nPaimon: Buuut we do know the best places to eat in Sumeru, and who you can rely on to help you out! That counts as knowledge, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, and to many people, it could be extremely valuable knowledge.\nPaimon: Great, so we're just as inspiring as them after all!",
            "About the Divine Tree\tPaimon: The whole of Sumeru City is built on top of a giant tree. How amazing is that!\nPaimon: We've seen lots of incredible trees on our journey, haven't we? There's our old stomping ground at Windrise, the Frostbearing Tree on Dragonspine, and the Sacred Sakura in Inazuma!\nPaimon: Sumeru's tree doesn't seem to have a fancy name though. People just call it \"the Divine Tree\"...\n{NICKNAME}: Sometimes, the most important things have the simplest names.\nPaimon: Really? Hmm, maybe you have a point. Long names would be kinda inconvenient if you had to say them every day.\nPaimon: Anyway, people in the city only have to say \"down below\" and everyone knows they mean the bottom of the tree.\nPaimon: What's that saying again? \"Names aren't things themselves, they're just words for things.\"\n{NICKNAME}: So is Paimon just a word for a thing, too?\nPaimon: Yeah. Well, uh, kinda. But... wait, no! No, Paimon is just Paimon!",
            "About Inter-Darshan Relations\tPaimon: So, with Sumeru having so many scholars in different Darshans, do you think they end up arguing a lot?\nPaimon: You know, just like the rivalry between Li cuisine and Yue cuisine in Liyue.\n{NICKNAME}: I'm sure they do. Conflict between different schools of thought is the most normal thing ever. As the Liyue martial arts novels say: \"Wherever there are people, there will be conflict.\"\nPaimon: Wow, what a line. That's heavy... But the scholars in Sumeru probably don't duel like Liyue martial artists, right?\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe they settle things with a game of Genius Invokation TCG.\nPaimon: Ohh, good point! A duel of wits!\nPaimon: Paimon can just imagine it: When one scholar can't convince another in an argument, he takes out his deck of cards, calmly sits down opposite his opponent, thinks for a moment, and then secures his victory!\n{NICKNAME}: That does sound like something that would happen in Sumeru.\nPaimon: The game ends, and the winner says \"good game\" as a sign of respect to his opponent. After that, both sides are back on good terms.\n{NICKNAME}: Umm, not necessarily...\nPaimon: Huh? Why?",
            "About Port Ormos\tPaimon: Whew, Port Ormos definitely has a different vibe to Sumeru City...\nPaimon: It's a bustling area, and there's so many outlanders. Plus, no one needs to spend all their time buried in their studies, which is nice.\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that's why they end up being disciplined by the port authorities. So you see, Paimon? If you don't study hard, you'll end up just like them!\nPaimon: Oh...\nPaimon: Wait! What was that tone of voice for!?",
            "About the Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys\tPaimon: Port Ormos is built on the ruins of the fortress of The Alliance of the... the... the alliance of something, anyway.\nPaimon: Ugh, the name's too long, Paimon can't remember it! Anyway, that's what all the bookish people in Sumeru say.\n{NICKNAME}: Oh, you mean \"The Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys\"?\n{NICKNAME}: Apparently, the alliance was formed by a bunch of arrogant pirate leaders, none of whom wanted to work for any of the others. They fought and looted each other constantly, causing endless chaos in coastal Sumeru...\n{NICKNAME}: Finally, one day, they decided to enter into an alliance with one another and divide power equally between themselves. The members of the alliance were called \"Deys\"...\nPaimon: Oh... And so after that... there was no more fighting and no more stealing, so everyone could get along happily and make a boatload of Mora together! Right?\n{NICKNAME}: ...\nPaimon: Right...?\n{NICKNAME}: Well... presumably that's what they were hoping...\nPaimon: Huh...?\n{NICKNAME}: Before long, they were forming factions again, and the infighting between them escalated into the biggest internal battle they'd seen yet. Their fortress at Port Ormos was completely destroyed, and all the Deys were done for!\nPaimon: Whaaat?\n{NICKNAME}: Following that, an unprecedented period of peace finally came to Port Ormos, and the area began to develop into what we see today...\nPaimon: Huh... So the Alliance was just a bunch of dumb bad guys...",
            "About Cyno and Genius Invokation TCG...\tPaimon: Cyno's super into that card game \"Genius Invokation TCG,\" isn't he?\nPaimon: Doesn't it seem kinda weird for the General Mahamatra to be into playing cards...?\n{NICKNAME}: Well... not when you consider his hairstyle.\nPaimon: Huh? What has his hairstyle got to do with it?\n{NICKNAME}: You know, when you're playing a card game, the fancier your hairstyle, the more distracting it is for your opponent.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What's going on with this guy? How did he manage to shape his hair like that?\"\n{NICKNAME}: When your opponent's mind is consumed with thoughts like this, you'll quickly gain the upper hand.\nPaimon: Hmm, really? Then we'd better think twice before playing against him...\n{NICKNAME}: I don't know... I think I might just have an advantage over him.\nPaimon: But you don't have a fancy hairstyle at all. And your clothes look pretty normal, too...\n{NICKNAME}: But I do have Paimon.\n{NICKNAME}: \"What's up with her? And what's that pesky flying companion of hers up to?\"\n{NICKNAME}: As long as Paimon is floating by my side, Cyno's mind will be consumed with thoughts like this.\n{NICKNAME}: I, on the other hand, would be completely unfazed by his hairstyle. So I'd be able to focus, and victory would be mine.\nPaimon: Forget it! If you wanna play cards, go get a funny haircut!",
            "About Sumeru Nursery Rhymes...\tPaimon: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ Hungry children it's time to come home~ ♪\n{NICKNAME}: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ ♪\nPaimon: Wow! Good job, so you remember the tune as well!\n{NICKNAME}: Good job to you too, Paimon. You sing really well.\nPaimon: Heehee, that's because Paimon's got a great plan!\nPaimon: Have you heard this story? Once upon a time, there was a hilihound who was given meat to eat whenever the samachurls started dancing. Eventually, the hilihound started drooling whenever it heard the sound of dancing.\nPaimon: Whenever we hear the curry song, we get curry to eat. So, all Paimon has to do is learn the song by heart, and then in the future, whenever Paimon is craving a big bowl of tasty curry, all she has to do is sing it!\nPaimon: Hey, aren't you gonna say something?\nPaimon: ♪ Curry, curry, in the air~ Hungry children it's time to come home~ ♪",
            "About Aranara Tongue Twisters...\t{NICKNAME}: Paimon, do you ever find that the word \"Aranara\" trips you up?\nPaimon: Hmm? Why, does it trip you up? Maybe that's because you don't really say anything most of the time.\nPaimon: Unlike Paimon! Paimon has to talk all the time, so she never gets stuck on words.\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, well, try reading this then.\nPaimon: What is it? Let's see here...\nPaimon: Arana the Aranara exercises Ararakalari in the nearby area.\nPaimon: Narana the Nara picks Padisarahs in a parallel area further afield.\nPaimon: Narana the Padisarah-picking Nara had arranged to invite Arana the Aranara to the bar to befriend Lambad, but alas, Arana the Ararakalari-exercising Aranara professed a preference to Padisarah-picking Nara, Narana, for venturing to Vanarana to view the panorama.\nPaimon: On account of Arana the Aranara's antipathy to bar drama, Narana the Nara relented and, upon accompanying the latter on a Vanarana-panorama adventure, encountered another Aranara, named \"Arama.\"\nPaimon: This must be one of those really weird dreams, right...\nPaimon: Ugh, but this headache feels pretty real..."

            "Character Details\tAn unknown bard that came from nowhere. He sometimes sings outdated songs, other times he hums new ones that none have ever heard of.\nHe likes apples and lively atmospheres, but hates cheese and anything that is slimy.\nWhen channeling Anemo, it appears in the form of feathers, because he likes things that look light.",
            "Character Story 1\tBack when traveling bard Venti had only been in Mondstadt for a few months, his income was far less than the other more established bards in town. But once he had a few Mora in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time — one of the city's taverns.\nUnfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.\nThe first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: \"I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here...\" Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...\nThe strategy he developed was drinking on the job — that is to say, playing the lyre while holding a wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performances instead of giving him Mora.\nThe novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.\nThere was just one snag — he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...\nAnd if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.\nVenti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.\nEasier said than done — the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere is a towering oak tree at the center of Windrise, said to have sprouted when Vennessa ascended to the heavens a millennium ago.\nIn the past few months, travelers resting in the shade of the great oak sometimes hear a young boy singing the tales of Barbatos, the Anemo Archon.\nUnlike the ruling deities of the other nations, Barbatos has long left Mondstadt. In fact, the only visible proof of his connection with Mondstadt is the Statues of The Seven that appear across the land — even then, the resemblance is vague at best. Fortunately, Barbatos's past deeds are recorded in books and epics, sung and passed on by the bards.\nIn contrast to these more canonical works, Venti's ballads tend to include bizarre adventures and acts of mischief, such as the time that Barbatos pinched the Cryo Archon's scepter and replaced it with a hilichurl's wooden club...\nWorshippers of Barbatos are quick to decry these frivolous tales as blasphemous fabrications. But whenever someone confronts Venti about this, his response suggests that he has not an ounce of remorse.\n\"How can you know that they're fabrications?\"\nHe has a point — even the most devoted sister could not possibly know the details of all of Barbatos's deeds from a millennium ago.\nOnly Venti knows the truth behind his song lyrics, and it is a truth he hides behind an enigmatic smile.\nReason being, yes — Venti's tall tales of Barbatos's unorthodox exploits are entirely fabricated.\nHey, Venti finds that a few drinks really gets his muse going. Can you really blame him?",
            "Character Story 3\tAround 2,600 years ago, the Archon War had yet to end, and the world had yet to fall under the dominion of The Seven.\nIn those days, the city called \"Mondstadt\" was surrounded on all sides by gales impenetrable even to the birds of the air. The wind's ceaseless howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.\nThe Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.\nIn those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.\nHe who would in latter days be known as \"Barbatos\" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.\nIn Mondstadt of old, Venti met a young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all.\n\"I do so wish to see the birds in flight.\"\nSo said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.\n\"Friend, will you not come along?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tThe elemental being Venti obtained the feather of an eagle for the lad living in that storm-shrouded city, who had never seen a bird in his life.\nThen, war broke out in Mondstadt, in the name of freedom.\nWith the feather tucked away in his breast pocket, Venti watched the fall of the eccentric ruler amid the wrack and ruin of revolt together with his friend.\nThe ruler had believed that he had given his subjects a city free from the bitter cold, and to the end, he believed that they had loved him as he loved them.\nYet, despite the victory, Venti was never able to give that feather to the lad, for that lad had fallen in the battle for the sake of song, sky, and birds, and for the people who, like him, had dwelled within the storm-wall.\nWith the crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity, a new god was born. The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.\nHis first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.\nFor only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.\nPlucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.\nHe bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.\nIn future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city.\n\"Surely, he too would have wanted to live in such a place.\"\nThus, a new age began for Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe Anemo Archon cannot take credit for everything in Mondstadt.\nCredit should be given where credit is due, I shall sing now the praises of things beauteous and true:\nWe thank the West Wind, whose enduring caress\nBrings the blossoms of Spring, by whose scent we are blessed.\n\nFinches, ducks, rabbits and boars,\nMondstadt's revival bid them thrive evermore.\nIn summer the lion walks the plains,\nNo words one finds to praise it but these:\nDo you sweat out your water to make way for wine?\nComes the heat of the summer from your mane of sunshine?\n\nThe mountain mouths and gorges low like drunkards wayward lie...\nBut the East Wind cares not, for it doesn't walk — it flies!\nOver the fruit trees it brushes low,\nAnd its wings bring the harvest of things that grow.\n\nThe North Wind in the silent forest slumbers,\nAnd around it pace the wolves in their numbers.\nThough most have never a glimpse of them seen, for the Wind knows that none is of winter too keen,\nYet the Anemo Archon glimpses and sees, that it dreams each night of warm reverie.\n\n—As the four seasons in turn shall say their piece, so the four winds too shall never cease.\nOf course, to look at it differently, I am the one who should be credited here, and not they.\nCredits should be given where credits belong — if not for the bard who pens the song, then who shall ensure that these tales are passed on?",
            "Where the Wind Doth Not Blow\tAfter 1,600 years of history, Mondstadt's \"freedom\" had sunk to a heretofore unseen low.\nBarbatos, unwilling to become a tyrant, had departed. But he had never imagined that those to whom he had gifted freedom would make for themselves a tyrant.\nThe aristocracy ruled Mondstadt with a cruel hand, bringing slaves into this land and ignoring the cries of the oppressed.\nThus the Anemo Archon returned after these 1,600 years to what was once the City of Freedom. He heard the cry of the slave girl Vennessa, and together with her raised a rebellion that overthrew the aristocracy.\n—Now, the above is what all know to be the official history of Mondstadt.\nThe story has an interesting, little-known twist, however.\nThe one who united the people of Mondstadt in this conflict was indeed the hero Vennessa — but that which caused many of the aristocracy's troops to turn coat was a \"treachery against the wind.\"\nA secret treaty was found, a betrayal of the city — the aristocrats had forsaken the wind, and sold everything in Mondstadt to the Geo Archon of the neighboring land.\nAt the treaty's end was carved an insignia inimitable by all save the deity so named: Rex Lapis.\nHow the soldiers that had once oppressed the slaves shuddered when they saw that they too would become slaves in a foreign land.\nThe news, and the conflict, spread like wildfire, consuming the aristocracy. It was only many years later that historians would discover that this treaty was fake.\nAs it turned out, Venti had once practiced the art of forgery in order to play pranks on the Geo Archon, but could never deceive the god of wealth and transactions. Even so, his adeptness would come into play after several hundred years.\nWhat a happy coincidence.",
            "Vision\tThe Seven Archons do not need Visions, for they already have great power.\nYet Barbatos was fond of the mortal world, and wanted to roam Mondstadt more freely as \"Venti.\" As such, he constructed a glass ornament very much like the Visions worn by those chosen by the gods.\nThe imitation has no special abilities, nor does Venti rely on it to channel elemental power.\nHowever, since Venti does not keep the Holy Lyre der Himmel by his side, and since he is too lazy to bring a normal lyre, he gave his fake Vision the ability to turn into the wooden lyre \"Der Frühling.\""

            "Character Story 1\tMany years ago, the Wanderer was not called by that title. Indeed, he has had many, all of which corresponded to a special status he possessed at that time. Today, many of these past affairs have been forgotten.\nThe puppet, the eccentric Kabukimono, the 6th seat of the Fatui Harbingers, The Balladeer...\nEach of these was a thread of fate tying the puppet's joints down.\nAny recollection must begin several hundred years ago, when the puppet that shed tears upon being born would not be given a name, but was instead only given a small golden feather as proof of his personage.\nHe would be laid to rest within the Shakkei Pavilion, staring blankly at the beauteous scenery within. The flaming maple leaves, the exquisite window lattices... Within that lovely prison, he lost all perception.\nIt was by accident that a kind-hearted samurai named Katsuragi would enter the pavilion and rescue him. It was Katsuragi who brought him to live in Tatarasuna and meet the people who lived there.\nThen, the puppet was as naive as a newborn, filled with goodwill and gratitude towards humans. Katsuragi, upon seeing the golden pinion on his person, knew that this puppet must not have been of ordinary stock, yet have his reasons not to mention his place of origin. Thus, he omitted all mention of Shakkei Pavilion, instead claiming falsely that he had found the young man while patroling Nazuchi Beach, and he bade the puppet play along so as to not expose the lie.\nBusy, bustling Tatarasuna was a place of many happy memories for the puppet. There, he was briefly human. There, he was briefly normal.\nKatsuragi, Mikoshi Nagamasa, Niwa, Miyazaki, and many other now-forgotten people from Tatarasuna would teach him to read and write, to start fires and make meals, to forge — yes, they accepted him as their friend.\nThey even asked him: \"Don't you want a name? Or are you going to let everyone out there call you the Kabukimono?\"\nYet he had no dislike for this name.\n\"Kabukimono\" referred mostly to those who wore vibrant colors and behaved in a peculiar manner. Yes, they made him different, but such was proof of his humanity — proof that he belonged in Tatarasuna.\nPity, then, that though he loved this name so, he would be forced to forsake it. For when he no longer wished to become human, it lost its meaning.\nHe would depart, and after arriving in the distant north, would join the wild banquet of the Harbingers, working to win the sixth seat among them.\nIt was the Tsaritsa who would grant him his new title — \"The Balladeer.\" Strength, power, and the desire for conflict — these he already possessed.\nThe chess pieces raised tides of madness amidst battle, and the slaughterers on the stage upended order.\nIn that moment, he was sure that The Balladeer was his true name.",
            "Character Story 2\tIn the early days when Tatarasuna was still a prosperous place, the Wanderer walked amongst its people, going by the name \"Kabukimono.\"\nAnd the thing that ended his peaceful life was not all that important in the grand scale of Inazuma's history.\nChange came to the place in the form of the Akame Clan and a mechanic from Fontaine named Escher. The two cooperated very closely to further improve forging quality, and in the process, Akame introduced Escher to Niwa, who was also from the three Isshin traditions.\nEscher's arrival caused quite the stir for a time, for it was through his revolutionary new techniques that they were able to process Crystal Marrow in such a way that their forging efficacy and production were both increased.\nBut as time passed, anomalies emerged within the great central furnace in Tatarasuna. Black gas gathered within the furnace, and it would gradually affect the bodies of the craftspeople there. Forging and smelting were the foundations of life in Tatarasuna, but now they had become death itself.\nAnd as the toll mounted, the great furnace further went out of control. None could get close to its core, and even stopping it became nigh impossible.\nAs the highest authority at Tatarasuna, Niwa was forced to enact an information blackout while sending people to Inazuma City to beg aid from Tenshukaku.\nFor some reason, however, those who took to the sea in ships never returned. Horror began seeping into the hearts of Tatarasuna's people.\nThe Kabukimono knew that Niwa needed the Raiden Shogun's aid, but did not know that this was the very year when she had successfully built the perfect puppet using parts of herself as material, thus handing over management of the nation to the Guardian of Eternity. He thus boarded a small boat and braved storm and rain to arrive at Tenshukaku, seeking an audience with the Shogun.\nBut she now dwelled in the Plane of Euthymia, and he was repeatedly refused. In desperation, he displayed the golden feather on his person and asked to see Yae Miko instead.\nAt this time, Miko was busy assisting the Guardian, and though she rushed down as soon as she heard this news, she could only meet the distressed Kabukimono briefly. Yet he had no ears for her promises to send people to their aid immediately, and returned in despair, convinced that the Shogunate had forsaken Tatarasuna.\nStill, the dispatch was sent, the people were mobilized, and they crossed by sea. Yet they arrived to no great disaster. Indeed, most people knew nothing of what had happened. It was the mechanic, Escher, who explained that Niwa had fled with his family for fear of punishment for his malfeasance, and that the Kabukimono had gone into the core zone in his place, shutting the furnace down.\nReceiving word that the Kabukimono had been friends with the fleeing Niwa, Yae guessed at the heaviness in his heart and did not wish to further disturb him, merely sending someone to return the feather to him.\nLater still, he would disappear without a trace from Tatarasuna. But as people reminisced, they could never forget the celebratory dance he had performed together with them on the day that Mikoshi Nagamasa successfully forged his great blade.\nHis steps fluttered lightly like a feather in the wind then, and they could not have known that he, like a feather, would depart from them and journey to places unknown.",
            "Character Story 3\tAfter leaving Tatarasuna, the Kabukimono met a young child in a small house by the seaside somewhere in Inazuma.\nThe young boy was weak and sickly, and he lived in a rickety old place into which the rain leaked. Seeing his constantly mud-caked face through the gaps in the decrepit wooden door, the Kabukimono felt something twist in his heart, as if some ancient feeling was being re-awakened. And so, he stayed within that wooden house to care for that sick boy, bringing him melons, fruits, and water to drink, helping him to wipe the filth from his face.\nMany days passed, and the child's parents did not return. It was only later that the Kabukimono learned that the parents were also workers from Tatarasuna, and they might have lived normal and happy lives, if not for husband and wife contracting some strange illness during their work, often coughing up blood as a result. That they had not returned indicated that they may have passed without any fanfare in some place out there.\nThe child's name was unimportant, for he had another identity: he was the Kabukimono's friend, and family besides. They talked about how they had been born and promised to continue to live together in that ramshackle hut. As proof of their friendship, the Kabukimono took the boy to Shakkei Pavilion to see the place where he had once lived.\nThe flaming maple leaves, the ancient latticed windows... All was as it had once been.\nAt that time, he believed that he would never return here... but he did not realize that the child could die in only one night. One night, barely enough time for the Kabukimono to go out and find some food or swipe some furniture that others no longer had any use for.\nThough he had already witnessed much change, he never knew that another person's passing was something that could occur in such a brief moment, or that this moment could grant him nothing but pain.\nAfter the shock, he felt incomparable fury. He was alone. Again. Was he not once more abandoned?\nAgain! Again! Again!\nThe boy's small body on the ground was curled up like a jumble of flower petals, a corner of it stained red with blood — red like the maple leaves... red like a blazing fire.\nThat night, a great flaming glow lit the seaside. The Kabukimono burned the wooden house, and finding himself an old straw hat from within it, left to begin his long journey.\nHe wandered everywhere, not knowing where to go, and though he would meet many more people along the way, he would never again regard any of them as his companions.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe sixth of Snezhnaya's Fatui Harbingers is known as The Balladeer.\nAnd yet this name was not his to own from the start. Indeed, they were yet separated by over a hundred years.\nAfter leaving Inazuma, he forsook the name Kabukimono, reverting to his nameless state, and did not even consider taking another until The Jester found him.\nIn the end, such titles as \"puppet\" or \"Kabukimono\" were all given to him by mortals. And since he would no longer have them as companions, there was no point in using the names they gave him.\nBut The Jester proved most persuasive, and the puppet was intrigued by the frenzied banquet he spoke of, and so accompanied the man to Snezhnaya to serve in the Fatui.\nA stranger named The Doctor would welcome him warmly in this frigid northern land, inviting the Wanderer to be the key reference material in his experiments — his grand research project.\nPuppet-making techniques had their roots in Khaenri'ah, and his nature as a creation of the Electro Archon made him all the more special. The Doctor was fascinated by this field of study, and, using the Wanderer as a foundational blueprint, would perform research and experiments for several decades before finally attaining the techniques that would go on to form the basis for his Segments.\nIn return, The Doctor would unlock the seal on his body, causing his abilities to greatly increase, to the point where he was a match for the lower-ranked Harbingers.\nBut even so, he did not choose another name. His colleagues called him the \"puppet,\" and so he saw himself also — a puppet, unafraid of death and inexhaustible.\nOn the Tsaritsa's orders, he would lead a company to explore the Abyss, and there he spent much time. More than once he was wounded, then repaired by The Doctor, and thus he grew stronger, surviving to be wounded again by ever mightier foes.\nMuch later, he would bring the results of his exploration back to Snezhnaya, gaining the sixth seat in the process. His orders were also changed. Instead of exploring the Abyss, he was now to constantly be on standby, assisting the clandestine activities of the Fatui across the world.\nAnd it was only then that he felt that that new name, \"The Balladeer,\" fit him.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe many things that happened after that might even be called soul-stirring, but for the fact that few now remember them.\nOnly those who witnessed those events would keep them as legends in their hearts, and so they continue to quietly exist, as ancient songs lost to the world.\nWithin Irminsul, The Balladeer came into contact with the \"truth\" that Lesser Lord Kusanali had placed within the flow of information. This secret had been hidden within one of The Doctor's many hearts, and just as she claimed, this truth in first person contained all his remaining honesty.\nAnd thus did The Balladeer come to know of past truths: Niwa, who had taught him how to live like an ordinary human and treated him like one, had not fled Tatarasuna to escape punishment as Escher had claimed. In fact, the true culprit had been Escher — no, The Doctor — all along. And as for the heart that had been placed within The Balladeer, it had been cut, still warm, from Niwa's breast.\nThis death had been nicely packaged within an incident at the forge, and such was Escher's silvered tongue that he all too quickly convinced everyone that this was due to the failings of the local overseer.\nAs the next person in charge, Mikoshi Nagamasa would have faced capital punishment if not for the intervention of his loyal samurai retainer, Katsuragi, who willingly took the burden of wrongdoing upon himself.\nThe tragedy that followed need not be elaborated upon. Nagamasa, unwilling as he was, had to wash the stain from the Mikoshi name, and could not allow himself to die here.\nAnd so he brought forth his beloved blade, the Daitatara Nagamasa, and struck Katsuragi down in a single blow, the blade cutting so deep that it nearly split the slain man in twain...\n...And had they not all believed in their god?\nWhy then, did they have to face such a calamity?\nIf the enigmatic puppet they called the Kabukimono had never existed, would Escher have done the same thing there?\nEven if the chance were infinitesimal, could the tragedy of Tatarasuna have been salvaged?\nAnyone anywhere else in this world would be able to do nothing about this, but not The Balladeer. He knew that he alone could attempt this one thing, here and now.\nHe believed himself bold, for he feared not death. Death was but a tiny threat to a puppet, and only humans with hearts knew horror.\nHe also knew himself to be craven, and for that he had remorse. If he had been then more like he was at present... if he had learned to be less trusting... Would those he had viewed as friends have met such a ruinous end?\nTraitor, hero, god, discarded detritus — all these identities would cease to matter to one who leaped into the flux.\nThe information flow was a place of incomparable silence, and yet his blood roiled in his ears, and his mind roared.\nEmbrace oblivion!\nThe puppet was a discarded milksop, the Kabukimono unaccomplished and sheltered, and Scaramouche was a schemer — one who eventually went against divine decree, seeking to go against the tides of the world.\nBut what of it?\nOnce upon a time, these inhuman hands had shut a great blazing furnace without caring if his ten fingers were burned to a crisp.\nNow, these hands grasped at the tiniest possibility, twisting the truth to fulfill his wish.\nYes, embrace it, embrace it with this form that shall be obliterated!\nTo ruin with this life, as worthless as flowers and feathers and the dawn dew!\nFarewell, world! The future shall be what it will. Farewell nonetheless!",
            "Tiny Doll\tHaving decided to stop by Sumeru, the Wanderer took some time off to visit Treasures Street and learn how to make toys from some of the merchants there.\nIn a corner of the bustling street, a kind-hearted old fellow with hair as white as snow invited him to sit by his side, teaching him how to use cloth and thread to sew that which he wanted to make step by step.\nThe Wanderer spent much time practicing, doing this thing that did not agree with his personality. Strange, perhaps, but he did not hate it.\nHe had done such things with great patience in times past, after all, learning things such as holding cutlery, wearing clothes, combing his hair...\nYes, he had learned to be a \"human\" from the little things up.\nA few days later, his great work was complete — a little man with white clothes and black hair, a waistband tied using a butterfly knot, and a clear, round tear at the corner of his eye.\nIndeed, back then, there was a young fellow who had made this doll in imitation of the Wanderer's past appearance. Shame, then, that he had burned both the doll and his old home to ashes when he left Inazuma.\nMany years later, he would make one as well, and oh, how familiar that felt!\nSmall and soft as it was, it was akin to a defenseless babe. It took up little space in his sleeves, and if he kept it in his hat, it felt like having a travel companion.\n\"From today, you shall wander together with me.\"\nHe said softly, placing it in his pocket.",
            "Vision\tIn that instant, the Wanderer could hear the wind's voice. He knew not whence it had come, only that it changed direction as if to greet him.\nOn it were scents old and nostalgic — the iron hammer, metals, the furnace, the dust of the earth...\nDistant dreams, a prosperous past... Incredible though it might seem, even he once led such a simple life.\nIn that instant, he beheld his own reflections, each one vivid, each one real, each one him.\nCowering in fear, pathetic in his agony, arrogant yet laughable... And they all coalesced into one body.\nTo accept the past is to acknowledge its failings, to recognize that one is naught but a coward who has achieved nothing — who has nothing.\nBut only by doing so could he break free of his shackles and become, once again, that tragic person.\nIn that moment, he knew this: that the appearances of peace and beauty were but an illusion. The real him had never died, no, it lived on deep within his heart. As long as he still had a choice, he would tread the same course no matter how many times he did this over.\nAs he moved like lightning itself, a blazing light came between him and the Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom, blocking its attack. His will and his choice had gained him the eye of the gods.\nThe Vision descended, and caught between bright light and darkness, the glittering ornament seemed almost like an eye on a smiling face, questioning him from afar: Can you, who have desires of such intensity, still be considered a being without a heart?"

That line was written on the title page.\nIf she was any other person, she would likely have regarded it as some cheesy inspirational quote. However, Xiangling regarded it as a priceless treasure.\nTo her, her father only secured his footing in the forever-ongoing war between the Li and Yue cuisines by upholding that principle.\nHowever, at that time, the conflict between the two styles was white-hot, with many restaurants feeling the pressure that arose from it. Wanmin Restaurant was no exception.\n\"Good food is good food, period!\"\nThe monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as matsutake and crabs infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.\nIt was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes.\n\"I'm gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!\"",

They one day awoke to find their fighting clubs gone.\nOf course, the flora in Dihua Marsh did not fare any better.\nAfter all the work she put in, she finally created some new recipes, such as Hilichurl Club BBQ Fish and Horsetail Sticky Rice and Meat...\nShe'd never create anything new if she just stuck to the recipes of her predecessors.\nOne must break with common conception if they are to carve their own path.\nWhen Xiangling finally created her crowning achievement, the Chef's Special Cold-Dressed Fowl, her father paid the price, needing to resort to simple white congee for two days following.\n\"Mint and Qingxin Flower seem to induce diarrhea...\"\nShe learned a valuable experience to add to her journal.\nStrange. She ate her own dishes, but nothing ever happened to her. Xiangling did feel guilty though.\nMaybe it was because she was young and healthy, or had somehow built up a resistance to certain toxins... One may never know.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhenever a customer asks what exactly was the perplexing creature that follows Xiangling around is, she tells them the story:\nThere was a sudden downpour one day when Xiangling was on her way to fetch some Violetgrass. Halfway there, she was already tired and hungry. She stumbled into a cave, and came across a strange shrine.\nSo she sat down by the shrine, and took out two pieces of spicy cornbread.\nShe gobbled down one, but left the other one on the shrine, intending to eat a little later, but then promptly fell asleep.\nWhen she woke up, the other spicy cornbread was gone and a mysterious creature was sitting in front of her, staring.\n\"Was it good?\"\nIt nodded.\n\"More?\" She took out some jerky from her backpack.\nThe mysterious creature nodded once again.\nThis was how Xiangling made a new friend. It seemed to be drawn to Xiangling's cooking, as the creature started following Xiangling around wherever she went.\nXiangling named it \"Guoba,\" after her favorite childhood snack.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter sampling every dish there was in Liyue, Xiangling's culinary skills drastically improved. Her specialty spicy dishes earned the praise of even her father, a veteran chef with over two decades of experience.\nShe created her unique and complex flavor profile through a generous helping of chili peppers mixed with fruits and herbs for increased aroma. She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: Black-Back Perch Stew, which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.\nSome have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes.\n\"Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight. Dry, then grind to a fine powder. Sprinkle into any dish for an aromatic boost.\"\nThis is one of Xiangling's secret recipes, arrived at through a painstaking process of trial and error.\nIn Xiangling's case, that means countless bouts of diarrhea, countless bruised knees bashed on rocky cliffs, and countless wasted potfuls of food that didn't quite turn out as expected.",
            "Xiangling's Map\tThis map of Teyvat is lined with dense notations in various colors, and if you read closely, you can find the places where Xiangling has been, and where she intends to go in future.\n\"The shellfish of the shallows around Guyun Stone Forest are unmatched in their freshness. They say that 'here be sea monsters'?\"\n\"Sea monster meat tastes great. Should look for Beidou to go fight another one. Will steaming them with eggs make them taste better?\"\n\"There's a dragon in Mondstadt? Great! I just need three days of provisions to get there.\"\n\"Valberries are sweet. Lots here. I'll bring a basket. Take some back. See if they'll grow.\"\n\"This Mondstadt restaurant's Sautéed Matsutake is way too luxurious! They should just sell the matsutake. Ooh, what if I fry some with Jueyun Chili? Sounds good already. Might as well borrow a kitchen tomorrow and give it a go.\"\n\"Haven't found the dragon yet. Am I in the right place?\"\n...",
            "Vision\t\"You can make something super delicious out of any kind of ingredient.\"\nXiangling earned the approval of a Vision by shouldering this ideal in a wholehearted and unreserved manner. Even when she would make dishes that could be called \"horrifying,\" her desire to keep trying to match ingredients would never waver.\n\"Ugh... Qingxin Fried Lizard is actually kinda bad. I think lizards should just be stone-grilled in future.\"\n\"Slime fried rice is also rather ordinary. Maybe we'll try putting mushrooms in a slime jus next time.\"\nThough her friends fell around her during the epic battles with the taste of her dishes and advised her to turn back, Xiangling never stopped thinking about how to turn these \"special\" ingredients into delicious food.\nIn Xiangling's innocent and persistent heart, as long as they were not poisonous, there were no good or bad ingredients.\nHer Vision, after all, proves that even the gods approve of such thinking."

            "Character Details\tXiao may have the appearance of a young man, but his true age is something over two thousand years.\nFortunately, people do not tend to underestimate him on the basis of his appearance — one only needs to spend a short time with Xiao to clarify that he is not someone to be trifled with.\nXiao is a man of few words. He is highly dangerous, and has the most piercing gaze you've ever seen.\nHe enjoys a formidable reputation and high level of seniority among the adepti, but is relatively unknown in the mortal realm.\nThis is inevitable. Xiao is not one of those popular deities to whom people pray for wealth and protection, nor is he a mystical sage of Jueyun Karst to whom pilgrims flock in search of divine wisdom.\nNo... If any mortal witnesses Xiao unleashing his true power, it is certain to be under the direst of circumstances — and they will be extremely lucky if they survive the ordeal.\nThis is not because Xiao seeks to harm people. Rather, since Xiao wages a constant war against dark forces powerful enough to devour Liyue in its entirety, any bystanders who witness him in the heat of battle are likely to end up as collateral damage.\nNot that this is a secret worth going around silencing witnesses for.",
            "Character Story 1\tWhat exactly is Xiao wrestling with?\nThe tactful answer would be old grudges, unfulfilled dreams, the lamentations of the vanquished...\nThe unmitigated truth is that Xiao fights against the remnants of the defeated gods from the Archon War, which took place prior to the rise of The Seven.\nMorax defeated those gods and buried their remains beneath the rocks of the earth.\nHowever, gods are immortal. Their consciousness may diminish, but their power and hatred will always remain and spread like poison, relentlessly stirring up chaos for the world and its inhabitants.\nLiyue's rulers, who are aware of the truth regarding Xiao, refer to him in his millennia-long experience as the \"Bane of All Evil.\" \nThe war he fights can never be won, and will never come to an end.\nIt is also an invisible war that no one will ever witness or thank him for.",
            "Character Story 2\tXiao is not this yaksha's true name, but a name given to him in the interests of his own protection.\nBack in a younger, more naive time, a god had gotten a hold of Xiao's weakness and forced him to serve as their bloodhound, in which capacity he was forced to perform cruel and violent acts.\nMany died at his hand, many hopes were crushed, and he was even forced into devouring his victims' dreams. As much as it pained him to do this, he was helpless to resist.\nFinally, on the battlefield of the Archon War, Morax, the Geo Archon, had a fateful encounter with the yaksha's master.\nThe current state of the world has already revealed the results of that battle.\nRex Lapis liberated the yaksha and gave him the name \"Xiao.\" \n\"In the fables of another land, the name Xiao is that of a spirit who encountered great suffering and hardship. He endured much suffering, as you have. Use this name from now on.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tTo repay his debt of gratitude to the Geo Archon, Xiao shouldered the burden of protecting Liyue in the millennia that followed.\nHis past of service under the evil god had rid Xiao of his innocence and gentleness. All that remained within him was the means to kill and the weight of his sins.\nThe only way he could be of service to mortals was in doing battle.\nBut what could people do for him in return?\nNo ordinary person would ever stop to ask such a question. The sight of Xiao, even far off in the distance, was intimidating enough to send people instantly running for their lives.\nThat said... if ever someone did want to show some appreciation for Xiao, there is perhaps one thing they could try.\nThere is a certain secret agent of the Qixing who is tasked with supporting Xiao in subduing demons. That secret agent runs a front organization called the Wangshu Inn.\nOccasionally, Xiao stops by the inn for a bowl of Almond Tofu, and if you could see the look on his face when he eats it... there's no mistaking it — he clearly loves the stuff.\nNonetheless, it is not the sweet taste that Xiao hankers after. It's the texture he finds irresistible — apparently, it's very similar to that of the dreams he used to devour.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhat exactly is Xiao wrestling with?\nTo those in Liyue's corridors of power, Xiao's battle is against the evil manifestations produced by the remnants of defeated gods.\nHowever, if you asked Xiao the same question, he may well give you an entirely different answer.\nXiao was once enslaved by an evil god and suffered immensely under their rule until finally regaining his freedom thanks to Rex Lapis.\nXiao's powers were highly regarded by the adepti and he seemed to vanquish all manner of evil demons with consummate ease.\nBut the evil gods also held immense power, and their lust for revenge ran deeper than mere mortals could ever contemplate. Xiao relentlessly slaughtered the endless, impure manifestations of their vengeful souls, but in doing so, he caused them to fracture. Eventually, these fragments of their hatred were able to taint Xiao's own soul.\nThe only way to eradicate such hatred is to accept the karmic debt it brings. The magnitude of the bad karma Xiao has accumulated over the years is enough to consume flesh, bone, and soul alike.\nAnd yet, Xiao does not feel any hatred. Having lived for over two thousand years, no single karmic debt constitutes anything more than a fleeting memory.\nNo grudge can last a thousand years, nor is any debt so great that it cannot be paid off in this time.\nXiao has spent many long years alone.\nBut his battles have never been in vain.\nBecause ultimately, the one with whom Xiao wrestles is himself.",
            "Character Story 5\tWhat does Xiao fight against?\nThe Traveler understands very well that Xiao fights against the darkness that threatens Liyue. He fights to defend Liyue.\nBut who will defend him?\nThere was once when most of Xiao's strength was spent fighting from dusk till dawn, with him emerging victorious by a mere hair.\nThe reeds in the fields had been sliced to ribbons in the fierce fighting. Plucking his spear from where it had been planted in the ground, Xiao began the trek home.\nWell, one says \"home\" — yet, where did Xiao have to return to? He was merely leaving the battlefield.\nLong exhausted, Xiao felt the divine hatred that tainted his body take effect.\nLimitless hate flooded his senses, and he fell to the ground in agony.\nBut it was also at that moment that the pain vanished without warning.\nThis was not by Xiao's own strength, for he had been rescued by the sound of a flute.\nThe clear, lovely sound of the flute came over the mountains and rivers, carried on the wind to where he lay.\nAnd clear it continued to ring till the first light of dawn brought with it the startled flight of distant birds.\nIt protected Xiao, massaging his wild senses, and giving him a moment's peace.\nWho was playing this music? Xiao was curious but did not pursue the matter. For he already had something approaching an answer.\nThe last person who could help him was one of The Seven themselves. So this person, too, must be—",
            "Ode to Windborne Wraith\tA scholar of the Sumeru Akademiya once did folklore studies in Liyue, the result of which was a book called \"Tour of the Land of Liyue,\" with separate editions being available in Sumeru and Liyue.\n\"Hidden Diamond and Cloudy Moon: Wonders and Folklores of Liyue\" is the version available in Liyue, and has had many mystical and magical portions removed.\nThe \"Ode to Windborne Wraith\" is one of the mystical chapters that remain recorded within the complete version at the Akademiya.\nThe document mentions that though the yaksha were mighty and upright among the adepti, they were bound by their own karma to suffer great horrors and tribulations. As such, they wandered the land in a state of unending suffering.\nThe chapter lists many methods of comforting the yaksha, such as food offerings, holy chants, and the like. These would appease the yaksha and help them to continue defending the peace.\nAs noble warriors among adepti, the yaksha would often descend upon the battlefield in person. However, as conflicts grew over the millennia, they have almost been wiped out. Today, large statues of the yaksha subduing demons remain within Liyue's borders, but they have had their features destroyed.\nBy the by, the language used in that text was so meandering, and its contents so dense, that it sold far fewer copies than the Teyvat Travel Guide and the international cultural summaries written by El Musk.",
            "Vision\tAll adepti are known as the \"mighty and illuminated\" adepti, and this \"illumination\" refers to the light of a third \"eye\" that they possess: a Vision.\nBut do adepti receive their Visions as a form of acknowledgment from Celestia, like humans do?\nXiao no longer remembers the moment he received his Vision. To humans, this would be an unforgettable event. But for him, this was just the beginning of his endless battle.\nThe thing that Xiao truly cannot forget is something different.\nThere are a great many human festivals, and few remember the stories behind them.\nThe greater part of these days coincide with occasions where man-eating monsters were defeated by the adepti host. People imitated their deeds and staged exorcism rituals to remember their ancient heroism, with these practices eventually evolving into celebratory festivals.\nThe hatred and residual might of many of the gods defeated by Morax throughout Liyue will sometimes erupt with abnormal force amid their half-awake, half-dreaming state. Among them, the eruption that takes place during the Lantern Rite is the most extreme in scale.\nXiao has his mission to perform the time-honored \"Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering,\" and so he fights night and day during the Lantern Rite. Thus, he has come to hate it.\nNow, Xiao did not consider battle dangerous. It was due to his hard work that Liyue was kept safe. People lit their lanterns, and the blessed lights shone across the night sky and the nearshore.\nAt that moment, another special feeling blossomed in Xiao's heart. Loneliness? Peace? Or was it his fears for the future? The young-seeming adeptus searched his heart, only to find no answers."

When she came to visit my family, my father and brother treated her with respect, and she was pleasant and polite in return. She seemed like a kind and mature young lady to me. But when I saw her elsewhere, she gave a completely different impression.",

            "Character Details\tEvery merchant in Liyue Harbor knows of Xingqiu from the Feiyun Commerce Guild.\nAll see him as a kind and well-mannered young man who is an excellent student, a top talent in every sense.\nAs the second-born son of the family, Xingqiu is not required to shoulder the burden of managing the Guild's affairs. However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers — that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants — and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.\nXingqiu's elder brother, while learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.\nHowever, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.\nSometimes, Xingqiu suddenly disappears for hours at a time with no explanation. When asked why, he simply replies: \"A moment of solitude.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tTo Xingqiu, \"a moment of solitude\" can mean all sorts of things.\nExamples include visiting Wanwen Bookhouse to peruse the latest novels and going to Heyu Tea House to sample Yun Jin's latest drink.\nSometimes, it means that he is off to fight for justice in the name of chivalry.\nDefeating bandits on the road, driving away monsters, helping distressed children by fetching their kites from the tree tops... there are all manner of responsibilities that fall into the category of chivalry.\nInspired by tropes from his beloved martial arts novels — such as the king who wears a disguise and mingles with the common folk — Xingqiu does not hesitate to leverage the power of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to resolve more complex issues when violence isn't the answer.",
            "Character Story 2\tOne day, Xingqiu's older brother came looking for him, only to find he wasn't around. When Xingqiu later returned, he came across his brother in the hallway.\n\"Your room was a mess, so I cleaned it up. Listen, both you and I are responsible for the reputation of Feiyun Commerce Guild. We have to act the part. If you can't clean up a room, how will you clean up the world? An adeptus once said...\"\nAfter half an hour of lecturing, Xingqiu was finally let go, but his brother said something strange at the end:\n\"I'll not enter your room without permission next time... I'll make sure the maids do the same.\"\nXingqiu had no idea what he was talking about. However, as his brother turned away, with a despondent look upon his face, he muttered to himself:\n\"Those books under his bed... No. No, I shouldn't go looking at what kind of books they are... Xingqiu is growing up after all... Don't want to be lecturing him all the time... Puberty perhaps?\"\nAfterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd. Expecting that one of the maids would have something to say about the stash of martial arts novels under his bed, he had long since prepared his response, but in the end, no one ever bothered to check his room again.",
            "Character Story 3\tTo keep Xingqiu from spending his whole day at Wanwen Bookhouse in Feiyun Slope, his father agreed to let him learn martial arts from the Guhua Clan. Much to his dismay, Xingqiu quickly discovered that Guhua was a dying art that had been in constant decline for years. There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan — they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.\nXingqiu's father was, of course, fully aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun. He thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.\nHe hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.\nXingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught to be exactly what he had hoped for.\nQuicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.\nHe decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it would take him. He reasoned that they would be useful to have in his repertoire during his future exploits as a chivalrous hero.",
            "Character Story 4\tThere are two sides to the swashbuckling Xingqiu's personality. While quiet and unassuming in front of strangers, he is gregarious and chatty in the company of close friends and family. Though more restrained than his elder brother, he even has a playful and mischievous side.\nThe one who usually bears the brunt of his bizarre sense of humor is someone named Chongyun, an exorcist usually found on one of the forest trails around Liyue.\n\"Chongyun... I found a haunted house for you to practice in...\"\n\"Chongyun, you have to believe me... It wasn't me who laid the traps inside that haunted house— What? It's not haunted? Well... I, uh, couldn't have known that, could I?\"\n\"Chongyun... Don't glare at me like that... Look, you're injured. You'd better just lie there and get some rest.\"\n\"Tell you what, Chongyun, we have a maid who learned the art of essential oil therapy in a nobleman's house in Sumeru... How about I ask her to tend to your wounds? You owe me for this, though...\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe notion of chivalry means different things to different people.\nChivalry means listening to your conscience calling you to action when you see an injustice, right? Or is chivalry simply about knowing right from wrong? No, that's not enough — it must have something to do with being a righteous person...\nTo Xingqiu, chivalry simply means: be good, and do good.\nAs a son of a wealthy merchant in Liyue Harbor, he was born to ride the waves in the world of trade. Notions of chivalry should have gradually left him as he grew up.\nHowever, obtaining a Vision changed everything — it meant he was finally able to accomplish those legendary deeds he could only dream of as a child.\nOf course, there is no way he can completely divest himself of his duties in the Guild, but so long as he gets to go out and be the hero even occasionally, he is perfectly content with his life.\nThe only thing that can wipe the smile from Xingqiu's face is when cynics question the true motives of chivalrous heroes.\nRank, reputation, reward, shadowy deals... Whenever Xingqiu hears people smearing the names of true heroes, the expression on his face may not change, but he will be sure to add that person to the special section of his blacklist reserved for people he despises even more than carrots.",
            "\"A Legend of Sword\"\tXingqiu once wrote a martial arts novel named \"A Legend of Sword\" based on his own experiences, intending to publish it in Liyue Harbor.\nTo his surprise, his manuscript was rejected by local publishing houses, who believed that no one would have any interest in a story with \"a setting as wildly unrealistic as the plot is banal.\"\nUndeterred, Xingqiu had a few copies printed privately, and sneakily placed them on the shelves of Wanwen Bookhouse during one of his many trips there. But just as the publishers had suspected, it failed to garner much interest from readers. This was quite a blow to Xingqiu's confidence.\nUnbeknownst to him, however, a passing merchant from Inazuma did purchase a copy to bring home, where it received rave reviews. Writers the region over attempted to copy the success of \"A Legend of Sword,\" but none succeeded — it maintains permanent residency in the number one bestseller spot to this day.",
            "Vision\tThe martial arts school known as the Guhua Clan has been in decline for several hundred years now. In its heyday, the name of the Clan rang like steel throughout the harbor. It was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts — the ways of the \"Light Piercer\" for polearms, \"Rain Cutter\" for swords, and \"Life Ender\" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.\nAfter many years, the Guhua Clan would finally get one in Xingqiu. It was he who successfully grasped the ancient \"Martial Principle\" after merely four years of study.\nThe Guhua weapon arts stress using the weapon as an extension of your body, and indeed this is a common idea amongst the various schools of martial arts in Liyue. But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial artists were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the \"eye.\" \nHaving come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that \"it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu.\" Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.\nThe verse reads thus:\nGuhua's arts I have studied long, in its secrets I am trained, now its long-lost depths fall upon me like the coming of blessed rain.\nThe beating heart of Guhua's sword art is as a shower of floating flowers. One amidst may seize a bloom, but those without read only doom.\nThe Guhua lance is a lantern's dance, like flames in night's deep glooming. Like sparks, they scatter with ease in the dark, then join like the daybreak looming.\nThey say the sword is as your arm — I say its glint is the beholder's eye, a light like the bright dawn coming.\nThose who wander are burdened not. Freely they cut rain, and enlightened they pierce light. Like a snaking dragon, they cannot be subdued. In their right eye the blade, and in the other the spear.\nThis text should have been free for all to read. The only reason why it was sealed is the dreadful handwriting."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tRock 'n' roll originates in Fontaine and is just starting to find its feet in Liyue Harbor, where Xinyan is pioneering the art.\nEvery night, she slings on her self-built instrument, steps onto her self-constructed stage, and plays her self-composed songs to a crowd of enthusiastic supporters.\nHer music reflects her personality: bold and defiant, loud and proud.\nShe is no virtuoso, but this doesn't bother her dedicated fans one bit as they let loose and enjoy the show, singing their hearts out and shaking off the stress of the day.\nIn the heat of the moment, the fire that leaps from Xinyan's Vision seems ready to turn night into day.\n\"She is a rare rock 'n' roll talent and a master performer who really knows how to create an atmosphere,\" said a review of one of her live shows in The Steambird.\nLiving in Liyue is expensive, especially when you want to enjoy the finer things in life. But as Xinyan would say to those tied down by worldly worries:\n\"If you know how to rock, then it's easier to roll.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tXinyan does not adhere to traditional performance norms at all. Anything can be used as her instrument.\nThe pillars on-stage, the floorboards, the cheers and yells of the audience, and even the explosions and sparks created by her Vision are valid brushes with which she paints her performance.\nThe impromptu stage often starts to burn somewhere after the halfway mark of the performance, till all that's left is a smoking pile of charcoal.\nAfter many warnings, the Millelith were finally forced to tighten their patrols and try to find ways to stop Xinyan from staging her performances.\nThe subsequent battles of wits tended to turn out in Xinyan's favor — she was often able to find a place to perform, set up a stage with frightening speed, and begin a raucous night with her audience.\nThe more reliable word on the street is that many patrolling Millelith were themselves infected by the \"spirit of rock 'n' roll,\" becoming her loyal fans in the process.\nXinyan would get wind of the Millelith's latest patrol plans from these \"friends of rock,\" and was thus able to avoid their eyes with ease.\nEventually, tiring of the lack of results, and in the absence of any evidence that anyone was harmed during Xinyan's performances, the Millelith came to adopt a \"one eye open, one eye shut\" approach to her actions.",
            "Character Story 2\tXinyan is tall, has a sharp gaze, and always wears her stage costume in public to keep herself in the right mood for her music.\nIn the eyes of bystanders, this makes her quite the imposing sight as she walks down the street, and many assume she means trouble.\nWhen she lines up to buy a snack, people in front of her in the queue will panic and move well out of her way.\nIf she happens to lock eyes with a young child, even for a brief moment, they will run crying to their parents.\nEven when she has done nothing at all, Xinyan is often suspected of wrongdoing, purely because her fierce appearance makes her look like some sort of heinous villain in the eyes of some people.\nXinyan didn't care all that much about how other people saw her, but she did think that it wasn't a good thing to scare others and make trouble for them, if she could at all help it. Thus, she constantly looked for ways to make a change.\nEvery day when she woke up in the morning, she would look at herself in the mirror and massage her face with her fingers to stretch and relax her eyes a little.\nShe would even practice smiling and study expressions — verbal and facial alike — of great elegance.\nAfter a significant amount of practice, she once came across a group of children bullying another child, and instinctually she went over to rescue the bullied child.\nShe gave the kid what she thought was a friendly smile and a gentle pat on the head. To say that the upset child quietened down after this would not be incorrect...\nHowever, the reality of the matter was that the child was stood there frozen in fear as urine dribbled down their pants.\nAs for the would-be bullies, they screamed and fled in panic.\n\"Run! Run! The angry lady's turned into a monster! Sh—She's gonna eat us all!\"\n\"Hey!!! I ain't gonna eat y'all! ...And I ain't no monster, either!\"\nBut it was to no avail. The moment she raised her voice, all her hard work was undone.",
            "Character Story 3\tXinyan has one standard by which she judges all things: is it or isn't it \"rock 'n' roll?\"\nAll that is just and upright — standing up for those who have been wronged, taking on challenges — is \"rock 'n' roll,\" and all that is reprehensible — fearing the wicked, oppressing the kind, dirty tricks, scheming ways — is \"not rock 'n' roll.\"\nRock is the spirit of rebellion and resistance, yes, but patently immoral acts are nonetheless \"not rock 'n' roll.\"\nXinyan reserves the right to make these judgments, and whether these judgments are based on results or her mood, the difference between the things covered by these two opposing terms is clear.\nThe only catch is that these standards sound odd in certain contexts.\nDue to her fierce appearance, Xinyan nearly has no friends, with Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant being one of the few exceptions with whom she can speak most freely.\nXinyan has a special reason for coming to Wanmin Restaurant — for musical inspiration.\nWhenever Xiangling is researching new recipes, others may run for the hills, but not Xinyan. She intentionally eats all the experimental products, and amid the taste bud explosion that results from the never-before-seen flavors, inspiration flows into her mind.\n\"Tell you what, Xiangling, that dish rocked!\"\nThough Xinyan considers this to be the highest praise, Xiangling finds it a little hard to be happy about such ratings.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe eternal subject of rock 'n' roll is resistance.\nBut the thing that Xinyan resists is not a concrete thing, but rather, the conceptual shackles of \"prejudice.\"\nShe was born into a poor family, and her parents placed great stock in her, giving her the best of what little they had in the hopes that she would be able to rise to \"become a phoenix.\"\nOf course, this \"phoenix\" would have to be something that they would recognize.\nBut things don't always turn out as planned. Xinyan grew to be taller than most girls, and her looks were far from anything that might be considered \"cute.\" Nor was she any good at any of the feminine arts, whether it was cooking, chores, needlework.\nSo, since her childhood was so deeply impacted by such \"prejudices,\" Xinyan understands how terrifying they could be.\nYet becoming a rock 'n' roll star has not caused her to give up on these other arts.\nThis is not only because she hates losing, but because she feels that \"giving up because you have no talent\" is itself a prejudiced belief.\nNot long ago, a fan of Xinyan's named Yun Jin was invited to her place as a guest.\nBut if Xinyan hadn't opened the door herself, Yun Jin would have thought that she had the wrong house.\nThe house was spick and span, the windows were clean, and the home ornaments were hand-made and immaculately arranged.\nThe cooktop was still moist, indicating that someone had been cooking not long before, and there was half-sewn cloth by the bedside that looked much like the decorations Xinyan wore during her performances.\nWhy, this was practically the room of some refined lady of reputable upbringing, with nary any spirit of rock 'n' roll to be found!\nXinyan was quite worried that this fan of hers would find the difference between their impression of \"rock 'n' roll\" and this reality too jarring.\nUnexpectedly, Yun Jin's support and fandom would only grow more intense after this.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe way Xinyan sees it, many adults fail to realize their potential because they are tied down by prejudice, giving in to fear and endless anxiety.\nThey do not understand what life is about, or where they are going.\nShe wrote these thoughts into her songs, but invited scorn from the very same adults. \"What does this brat know?\"\nEven so, Xinyan did not waver. After all, such mockery was born of prejudice towards her age.\nAnd if prejudice were something so easily overthrown, there would be no value in resisting it, would there?\nShe believes that rock 'n' roll is like a seed. After every performance, some seeds might sprout within the hearts of those adults who listen.\nWhen they wake up the next day, perhaps they might receive some inspiration, or perhaps a change of mood will come over them...\nEven if it only changes their thinking a little bit... Perhaps they might find that the real-life troubles they are facing are nothing but a storm in a teacup.\nOf course, few people other than her audience and the \"friends of rock\" would credit this to rock 'n' roll.\nBut people do nonetheless say this around the tables after tea.\n\"Well, having a girl who plays rock 'n' roll is pretty interesting, no?\"",
            "Xinyan's Instrument\tXinyan's main instrument is a hand-made guitar of a very unique design. She based it off the rock 'n' roll instruments that were imported from Fontaine before adding additional modifications based on personal understanding.\nFor example, she mounted a crescent-shaped axe-blade on the tail end of the instrument so it might serve as a weapon in a pinch.\nShe also connected it to her Vision, allowing it to spew flames and sparks. Its internals can also spew flame, all the better for it to self-destruct if it falls into the wrong hands, preventing its misuse...\nThe list of modifications goes on, and they are too numerous to count.\nThis instrument is thus unique, and its sound profile is also special.\n—Sorry, what? What do you mean, \"these modifications sound like they have nothing to do with music?\"\nSounds like you, too, need to attend one of her performances. You'll understand then.",
            "Vision\tXinyan was someone who never fit in in Liyue Harbor, and she only found where she belonged when she encountered rock 'n' roll.\nBut because she lived in a land that had no place for rock 'n' roll yet, she needed to be able to attract enough attention.\nShe immersed herself in the world of music, looking for a way to move people's hearts. She broke many an instrument and played till calluses formed on both hands, but still, it was unsatisfactory.\n\"Who'd want to listen to this racket?\"\nThe rotten-tomato reviews she received were starting to get to her. She wondered if she should quit.\nSitting on top of Mt. Tianheng, she looked down over Liyue Harbor. But though the lights lit the streets and alleys of the harbor, they could not light the flame of the spirit of rock 'n' roll.\nShe considered leaving, to go someplace where rock 'n' roll was appreciated. But would this not be running away? Would it not be a betrayal of rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance?\nNo, she would not leave. She would become a \"flame\" that could light Liyue Harbor up.\nShe started experimenting with the use of fire to move people, adding sparks and explosions to her music.\nBut this was no mean feat for an ordinary person.\nWho knows how many times she must have burnt her fingers or blown her instrument up. But still, she continued to practice every single day on top of Mt. Tianheng.\nAnd perhaps it was that the gods themselves had great expectations of this new form of music that would soon grace the seven nations...\nBut regardless, the boiling-hot Vision would be the final stroke of perfection.\nXinyan dashed down the mountain and began her very first rock 'n' roll concert in Liyue Harbor.\nThus did her musical journey begin, with showers of sparks and explosions keeping time."

            "Character Details\tThe head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine, descendant of Hakushin's lineage, Eternity's servant and friend, and the intimidating editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House, a publisher of light novels...\nCome to think of it, Yae Miko's nicknames are as myriad as her changeable moods.\nThe number of people who have tried to \"figure her out\" for various reasons could fill the streets from the Tenryou Commission estate to Yae Publishing House if you were to line them all up, but to this day, very few indeed have succeeded.\nNot that Miko has ever intended to conceal anything, of course. Any capriciousness is but the result of doing as she wills and pleases. A riddle with no solution is no riddle at all, in any case!\nYou just need to remember that she will always be none other than the wise and beautiful Yae Miko.",
            "Character Story 1\tYae Publishing House's editors once submitted a certain manuscript to the editor-in-chief.\nThis work was well-written, clearly thought out, and the themes were romance with a side of comedy — a prime slice of the zeitgeist.\nSuch a gem would surely require but a thin coat of polish and a few beautiful illustrations to sell well!\nBut unexpectedly, Yae Miko did not seem pleased with this, instead heaving a deep sigh before calling for the various head editors.\nOne of them asked hesitantly, \"Lady Yae, I... Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn't this the hot genre of the day?\"\nFaced with the editor's doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, \"not free enough.\"\nThings like \"top sellers,\" \"genre fiction,\" these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.\nGetting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?\n\"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well.\"\nUpon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany. Several months later, a new manuscript was sent to Miko and her editors.\nThe latter were stunned, and even Yae Miko, who cared little about taboos, furrowed her brows slightly — a rare sight indeed.\n\"Um... What do we do? This isn't good...\"\n\"Exactly! I mean, there's 'not being concerned about genre, and then there's something like 'Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden'... This is just too much!\"\n\"Hmm? Genre? No, no, there's no problem with that — it's his pen name I'm worried about. It's too normal for a book like this.\"\n\"Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind. As long as you're happy, Lady Yae.\"\nNot long after, the author of this book would take to the literary stage with the Yae Miko-approved (and overly long) pen name \"Kadenokouji Kenzaburou.\"\nAs to how the editor-in-chief got the idea to start a \"Reborn as Guuji Yae\" writing submission event, that would be a tale for another day.",
            "Character Story 2\tIf there was something inconvenient about being the Guuji, it is that she must attend every shrine ceremony, dressed up to the nines and in her proper place in the sanctuary.\nThe fireworks paint the night skies as they blossom, and the sounds of human merriment fill the shrine, and yet she must sit within, a solemn smile on her face...\nSuch tragedies are even more frightful to Miko than the possible wholesale disappearance of Fried Tofu from Teyvat.\nWith the somewhat longer span of years that the Electro Archon's servants have, a hundred years pass in the blink of an eye. As the years fly by, boredom becomes the greatest foe.\nAnd if even she were, archon-forbid, one day to accept sitting quietly still, obstinate as deadwood, would the world now sorely lack for another clever person adept at discovering fun and grasping opportunity?\nAs such, looking for fun things to do in every nook and cranny can only be the most reasonable and necessary course.\nAnd if she were to, say, utilize her authority as Guuji in making fun things happen — why, some things are unavoidable, are they not?\nOn the day of the festival, Guuji Yae would nod in satisfaction as she received a delivery of fireworks from the Yashiro Commission — of Naganohara construction and specially-made to boot.\nThat night's ceremony was, of course, performed with perfect respect to all etiquette and rites.\nThe sight of the \"Lady Guuji\" kneeling gracefully the whole night through would be the object of awe for all the other shrine maidens.\nIn the meantime, she would sit beneath the meteor shower of light adorning the skies, watching the festival-goers as they came and went.\nAnd the din of the fireworks covered the mumbling that came between teeth chewing on a candy apple.\n\"You know, when you asked me to become Guuji, you never mentioned that I'd only ever be able to sneak outside to watch the festivities from then on.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tPursuing fun and finding happiness is how Miko lives her everyday life.\nFor someone who enjoys studying humanity like her, \"perspectives\" and \"virtue\" play distant second fiddles to \"fun.\"\nEven a great shrine maiden of a different faith or an enemy general might pique her interest.\n...That said, this appreciation can sometimes lead to some innocuous trouble.\nAs opposed to those conscientious underlings or worshipful juniors, Miko's favorite person at the shrine is a shrine maiden named Kano Nana.\nYes, that Kano Nana, the novel enthusiast (just like Miko) who constantly frets over Sayu.\nWhile laying about indoors, Miko would often see Sayu flash past the window, followed not long after by a hurried and angry Kano Nana.\nLike lightning and thunder they were, which caught Miko's attention, to the point where she would even sometimes give wrong directions just to let the ruckus go on for a little longer.\nThere was another time when Sayu told Miko that the afternoon sun was the most pleasant after the latter had helped her steal some time for napping.\nPerhaps encouraged by these words, Miko would transform into an ordinary Inazuman lady on a wonderfully sunny afternoon, descend from the mountain and have a day out.\nThe Aisa Bathhouse in the city, Hanamizaka's Kiminami Restaurant, Ogura Textiles and Kimonos by the streetside... she did not miss a single store, and every one was an enjoyable experience.\nAnd in the evening, she was at Bantan Sango Detective Agency to tell them of a missing animals case that she had heard about on the way.\n\"But you really must help, good detectives. I mean, one can barely stand to watch those owners cry their eyes out as it is...\"\nHaving done all this, the lady could not help but let slip a pleased smile.\nTaking part in Inazuma's daily life in such an identity really was fun.\nWell, except that part where Kujou Sara shot her a suspicious glance as they passed each other by.\nRight, and also, she probably owed the boss of Aisa Bathhouse an apology — the outland-styled hot springs were indeed very good, but she might have accidentally shed some fox fur during the soak.",
            "Character Story 4\tA long, long time ago, humanity did not need to use the phrase \"a long, long time ago\" to preface tales about youkai.\nThe tengu dominated the skies, the oni swept across the battlefield, the tanuki were seen along small paths, and the kitsune walked amongst humans.\nUnder the banner of Narukami, the incredible powers of the youkai host were used to help humans through an era of strife and poverty.\nSeeking refuge in the mountains, they built a city by the sea, and so began Inazuma.\nAmongst the youkai, the lineage of Hakushin Kitsune was the most revered, and it was this great line that left a great many tales amongst humans.\nWhenever the youkai gathered to feast and sup together, a little braggadocio about how their latest exploits had become legend anew was very much a given.\nOf course, considering the amount they would drink, most tales told afterward would diverge a little from the truth. But no one minded, asking only that the tale be interesting. As time passed, this became known as \"hyakumonogatari daikai,\" or \"the great meeting of a hundred tales.\"\nIt was no uncommon sight to see Urakusai raise his cup and speak, holding all the other youkai spellbound with his story, drawing even smiles from Kitsune Saiguu, the organizer of the event.\nInstead it was Miko, who was then in the form of a young kitsune, who would perch on Kitsune Saiguu's shoulder and relentless peck at any loopholes in Urakusai's story.\nUrakusai, being a cool-headed and brilliant gentleman, would explain as he twirled his beard.\nBut Miko could always find something new to nitpick, and so they would go, back and forth, until Lady Saiguu would smile and call both parties to a halt: the audience wanted to hear the next part, after all.\nAfter another three rounds of drink and several more rounds of stories, the company would be hard-pressed to even string a sentence together, let alone a story.\nAnd so the gathered youkai would dispense with the word-fencing and use their powers to take to the skies to see who could best cover the sky and moon with their powers.\nAnd thus it was said that \"a hundred youkai shall parade upon a moonless night.\"\nFive hundred years on, that little kitsune has already become a mighty youkai in her own right.\nAs for the youkai who drank with them in those days, they disappeared amidst war and history, and their remaining bloodlines grow thinner by the day.\nAnd thus did their great parade, the Hyakkiyakou, become something that happened \"a long, long time ago.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe swords of Inazuma have always been famous the world over, and the best works of the Raiden Gokaden in particular are national treasures.\nHowever, only a short time ago, more than half of the five artisan lineages were cut off.\nA great number of powerful people were caught up in that conspiracy, and those responsible were all called to account and banished.\nEven the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was implicated due to their failure in supervising their subordinates...\nBut before the Shogun could give her final judgment, the Lady Guuji, who usually did not meddle in government affairs, suddenly interceded, rescuing the Kamisato Clan in their hour of peril.\nThus, while they suffered a serious blow, they were spared from dismissal.\nIn the years that followed, others would speculate greatly concerning the Guuji's actions.\nSome observed the close relations between the Yashiro Commission and the Grand Narukami Shrine, and guessed that she had intended to foster advocates loyal to her.\nAnd yet the shrine had always been an entity unto itself, and the Lady Guuji did not usually meddle in governance. Thus this action seemed a sacrifice greater than the reward — hardly a wise decision.\nSome others said that the Guuji suspected something to be wrong with the whole situation, and now that the list of those involved was so extensive, any major shakeup in the Yashiro Commission could destabilize Inazuma itself.\nThis thought, too, seemed reasonable on face, yet did not stand up to scrutiny. After all, was not the rise and fall of great houses merely ordinary in the grand scheme of mortal affairs? And even if the Kamisato were to fall from grace, new leadership for the Yashiro Commission would emerge.\nYet another story said that Miko engaged in secret talks with the Kamisato clan head just after the initial shockwaves had died down.\nBut the wounded clan was like a candle in the wind at this point. What power could they have to change the situation?\nTo this day, all these speculations have never amounted to anything, nor have any answers emerged concerning Miko's actions and motivations.\nBut what none know is how Miko's words that day would become as engraved into the Kamisato Clan as their house's crest.\n\"That the Kamisato Clan has survived this incident is only due to the Shogun's mercy. Do not forget this in the days that follow.\"\nThese words would serve as a seed of destiny, foreshadowing the Yashiro Commission's future position.\nIn some other time, if a storm were to descend upon Inazuma, and even if they were to come into conflict with the other two commissions, the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan would remember the favor they were shown and abide the Shogun's path to Eternity.\nThis was a move that the Guuji played with no regrets whatsoever.",
            "Fire-Soothing Festival Committee\tThe Fire-Soothing Festival Committee was once an organization chaired by the Tenryou Commission and managed by the Grand Narukami Shrine, whose remit was to pray for a lack of any fires in the coming year.\nIn those days, Inazuman houses were mostly made of wood, and any carelessness while handling fire could lead to disaster.\nThus, the Tenryou Commission was charged by the Shogun with setting up fire brigades to conduct rescues and damage control when fires did break out, and they also requested that the Grand Narukami Shrine set the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee up to comfort the frightened people.\nIn later years, anti-fire precautions would become second nature and serious cases would no longer occur often, but still the annual festival would remain.\nThe shrine maidens would dance elegantly, and the people would give generously... with the proceeds split forty-sixty between the Commission and the Shrine.\nWhen Yae Miko was faced with financial issues while attempting to start Yae Publishing House, she considered the various services that the shrine ran at the time before locking onto this ancient traditional committee.\n\"I mean, the busywork is solely done by the Grand Narukami Shrine, so why do we have to split the proceeds with the Tenryou Commission?\"\n\"What's more, all that Mora's just going into Kujou Senior's pockets. It's not like the fire brigade has ever gotten a year-end bonus or anything.\"\nAs such, after some preparation, the Fire-Soothing Festival of that year would be changed to no longer feature dancing shrine maidens but a grand, rollicking light novel submission contest.\nThe organizing body for this competition and any subsequent publications, the \"Yae Publishing House,\" would also \"borrow\" the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee's budget.\nAs for the profits? Into the shrine's coffers they went.\n\"Well, we no longer have many fires, and yet our budget keeps increasing. Thus, this restructuring relieves the financial burden placed upon the people.\"\n\"Also, the study of lore and the writing of literature and poetry is also a way of pleasing our Archon — surely you do not claim to know more of ritual and ceremony than I?\"\nThat was what Yae Miko said most solemnly to Kujou Takayuki when he came by unannounced.\nThe Tenryou Commissioner was ultimately forced to leave the way he came, stormy-faced, along with his attendants.\nLittle did any of them know that the moment they stepped out of the shrine, the somber Lady Miko would pluck a novel manuscript from the nearby offering box and continue annotating it.",
            "Vision\t\"That was a contest of magic for the ages! The foe split the seas as they strode across the skies, heaven and earth changing hue as they approached!\"\n\"Gohei in hand, the Lady Guuji was solemn as she strode up Mt. Yougou.\"\n\"All around her the shrine maidens chanted their mantras as the clouds masked the sun, the thunder waiting within for the moment to strike!\"\n\"...\"\n\"The battle was a grinding, protracted affair. In time, even the Guuji began to falter, and the enemy seized that opening, lashing out with great force!\"\n\"Just then, a bolt of lightning descended like a falling star before the Guuji — a glimmering Vision!\"\n\"Grasping it in her hand, the revivified Guuji showed forth her power and...\"\n\"Now wait just a minute! None of what you just said happened, right?\"\n\"Hmm? Well, how about this then? It all started the day when I had a most vicious \"Ramen Duel\" down in Hanamizaka...\n\"Oh, come on! Nobody's ever gotten a Vision from eating ramen!\"\n\"But wouldn't that be interesting? I mean, these are the sorts of stories you like to hear, right?\"\nYae Miko gave a thin, enigmatic smile as she was faced with the traveler's curiosity.\n\"After all, would you believe me if I said that 'my Vision is purely ornamental, just for show,' little one? Hardly — not even if it were the truth.\""

            "About Keqing\tThe Yuheng doesn't deal with matters of the law, and thank goodness... Knowing Keqing's attitude toward work and ruthless efficiency, I'd end up losing a lot of work.

            "About Eula\tEula saved me once, and we've kept up correspondence ever since. She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all.",
            "About Yelan\tYelan is an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs — she once helped me crack a tough accounting fraud case. I treated her to dinner afterward. The only thing is... I feel like she's able to read my mind at any given moment when talking to her... Yes, in the future, I need to make absolutely sure I don't get on the wrong side of her.",

When she was doing her coursework, she used to meet with me to discuss some cases, and after we were done, she'd always bow and thank me, which would always make me a little embarrassed. I always felt like she was going to make an excellent lawyer in the future. Thinking about it, Inazuma went into lockdown right around the time she would have graduated. I wonder how she's been doing since she went back...",

You came just to chat? Uh... no fee necessary then. So just to clarify... you came to chat as friends with a legal expert that you've never met before... care to explain?",

Naturally, I don't have to concern myself with adeptal affairs — I'm free to focus on the life I want to live. Works for me! Hee-hee.",
            "More About Yanfei: III\tContracts of that magnitude — lifelong commitments... I've only ever signed one with my father. Uh... it's about living happily, I suppose. That's the kind of person he is. I'm proud of him for that. If he'd wanted me to sign a different contract, say... one about working myself into the ground, or stepping on others to achieve success... I would've ran away by now!",
            "More About Yanfei: IV\tSometimes, the commercial disputes I handle don't end very pleasantly. The other party might win compensation way in excess of the damages, or pay damages far exceeding the costs... Such is the price of violating a contract. Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern!\nThink about it — the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts. People are a lot less likely to violate contracts when they see the fallout. Making sure that people realize the importance of contracts is a crucial part of my work!",
            "More About Yanfei: V\tMost of the time, I feel that I have a happy and laid back existence. I have a successful career, clothes on my back, and the freedom to go wherever I please. I've also got quite a way with words — nobody can beat me in a debate. And yet, there is no law or standard that can define a happy life.\nFor me... interesting people and engaging affairs, knowing where to go and which path to choose... these are all enough to bring me happiness. And on that note, you too are a source of happiness for me.\nIn any case, whatever the life you live, the most important thing is to respect and understand the law. After all, as soon as you stray from the law, the world begins to fall to ruin.",
            "Yanfei's Hobbies\tMy hobbies are reading and appraisal. Reading begets knowledge, appraisal improves judgment. As such, I read everything and appraise anything. If you don't believe me, bring something over sometime. If there's a market for it, my estimate won't be far off. Take this stone for example... must be... 600 Mora.",
            "Yanfei's Troubles\tMy friends from the Communications Office often get me to go fishing with them. They say it's to exchange angling tips, but deep down everyone's keen to show off. I've gotten the better of everyone a hundred different ways, but they continue to scrutinize my business... After so much success, it's gotten a little embarrassing... So every time, I end up taking advantage of my ingenious acting skills to make myself seem humble, you know? What's with the face — are you doubting me?",
            "Favorite Food\tOh! On that note, let me recommend my one true love. Tofu — tofu all the way! Light in flavor, tender in texture, not to mention smooth and nourishing. It goes well with all manner of soups and dishes, and more importantly — it's available throughout the seasons! Beauty over complexity... tofu dishes are my kind of flavor.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI don't like cold dishes... maybe it's because I rarely eat them. When I would get home late, my father used to keep a lantern lit for me. He'd hear me coming and ask me if I was hungry. In his words: \"The best dishes are served hot.\"",

            "Character Details\tLiyue is a port that prizes contracts and trade, and it is a place where wealth accumulates.\nMerchants from various nations are active here, which has contributed to Liyue's abundance, but has also brought up many disagreements. The Tianquan, Ningguang, has written a very comprehensive compendium of laws to deal with this, but not everyone has the patience to study them.\nThus was born the role of the legal adviser in Liyue society. Highly familiar with Liyue's laws, they help those in need to navigate any contradictions, earning recompense for their efforts.\nYanfei is the premier legal adviser in Liyue Harbor.\nShe is always able to obtain the most benefits for her clients, insofar as the law will allow. Some even call her \"the law that walks.\"\nBut in truth, what Yanfei — one of the few half-illuminated-beasts who have yet to sign a contract with Rex Lapis — really wants to do is live a free and happy life.\nAs for the copy of \"The General Law of Liyue\" that she carries around on her person, Yanfei has this to say:\n\"If you don't wish to be bound by the rules, you have to first understand them all.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tAs the most sought-after legal adviser in Liyue Harbor, Yanfei's rates are also top-of-the-line.\nEven so, she never lacks for people coming to seek appointments. After all, merchants are not stingy about mediation fees, but are very picky indeed about the mediator.\n\"Money is no object — we must have Yanfei come and settle this matter for us.\"\nMany rate Yanfei in this fashion, not only for her quick-thinking or her masterful oratory, but also because she very greatly emphasizes the cornerstone of the law — \"fairness.\"\nHer mediations often end in win-win situations, and even merchants with daggers drawn will temporarily set their prejudices aside.\nThough she is unbound by a contract, Yanfei has made her own contribution to the peace and prosperity of Liyue.",
            "Character Story 2\tAs a legal adviser, Yanfei does have her fair share of weaknesses. An example is the mediation of civil disputes that involve emotions and relationships.\nDivorces, inheritances, custody disputes, senior care, severances... The list continues.\nIt is said that upright officials are hapless in household affairs, and so it also is with Yanfei, who grew up surrounded by love — these matters fall right into her blind corner.\nSometimes, she will find that both sides have reason on their side, and other times she will find them to both be unreasonable. Child custody disputes are the absolute worst, as no matter how she settles them, the settlement will have a great psychological impact on the innocent children. Even if Yanfei chooses to soldier on, she will only tire herself out.\n\"Hopefully, everyone can meet the right person and be spared this particular grief.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tAs a result of her greatly tolerant nature, Yanfei has a wide variety of personal relationships throughout Liyue.\nThere is no need to worry about rubbing a sore spot, and you'll be able to get along with her whether you're an avid conversationalist or not.\nOf course, this is true as long as you don't attempt to debate with her or start a conversation about the legal profession... Yanfei in work mode is a completely different beast to deal with.\nAdditionally, Yanfei has cultivated the habit of being overly rigorous from her long years of studying the law. When chatting, Yanfei will vigorously eliminate any ambiguity or loopholes present in the discourse and can seem like a bit of a chatterbox. When she realizes this, Yanfei is wont to knock herself on the head with a book in irritation.\nHowever, so long as she constantly bathes in a sea of legal literature, this habit will probably be quite hard to break.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen investigating the law, Yanfei's habit is to look past the cold letters of the law to perceive their point of origin.\nAs such, she is also something of a master of \"reading comprehension\" in her relationships.\nOnce, the Traveler met Yanfei by chance and said, \"Huh. Didn't expect to see you here.\"\nThis should have been a line that one might hear just about anywhere, but it wound up holding a completely different meaning for Yanfei.\n\"Didn't expect to meet you here\" implied that the Traveler had at least thought about a scenario in which they would meet. Then why the use of \"didn't expect\"? One could only postulate that the Traveler had some expectation of where she might appear, and that her current location was not such a place. But whence came the expectation? Could it be that the Traveler had always been paying attention to her in secret?\n\"Does this mean that the Traveler...?\"\nYanfei tossed and turned in bed that night, unable to sleep.",
            "Character Story 5\tYanfei's most prized possession is the steelyard balance that her father gave her.\nIt is said that this balance was a treasure given by Rex Lapis that can be used to measure the value of all things. For convenience, Yanfei tends to use Mora to balance the scales, which is to say that she uses Mora to evaluate objects.\nThe prices of many objects have slowly changed over the years, but weighing an object with this balance only gives its value at the time Mora was created, leaving the rest to Yanfei to exercise her own wisdom and judgment.\nAcross the measurements of countless objects, Yanfei is able to see the changes in Liyue. Some objects that were once common have become vanishingly rare, and some exotic objects of the past have been rendered pedestrian today.\nThis steelyard balance reminds her that many things cannot be valued by the standards of the world.\nYanfei once tried to weigh the value of a Vision, but no matter how much Mora she added, the scales would not be balanced.\nIn frustration, she placed on the scale the box at her waist, which contained her heavy, handwritten legal notations. Only then did the weights at last even out.",
            "Codex Finalem\tThis is the most special of the many legal treatises that Yanfei collects.\nAs opposed to the codices that grow heavier and more complicated with time, this book is unbelievably light and thin.\nAfter opening it and getting past the prologue, one will find naught but the most basic few principles of the law inscribed.\nAs Yanfei sees it, this is the final form of the law. In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world. The halls of judgment will lie empty and the mountains of legalese shall be caked in years of dust.\nThough this may sound like something very far off, for someone like Yanfei, in whom flows the blood of an illuminated beast, living till that day is hardly a great accomplishment.\n\"Hmm, but if I think about it more deeply, I'd be out of a job then, wouldn't I?\"\nAfter encountering one of Xinyan's performances by chance, Yanfei was quite taken by this new wave of performance art.\nThat said, learning an instrument from scratch proved to be a bit difficult, so after consulting a great many resources, Yanfei came to what she considered to be a decent backup plan.\nIf such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper.\nFor someone who can recite tens of thousands of words' worth of Liyue law from front to back within an hour, speed at least should be no challenge.",
            "Vision\tYanfei's father is an illuminated beast, while her mother is an ordinary mortal merchant. Born into peaceful times, Yanfei did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis, but instead has one with her parents to \"live happily.\"\nAs Liyue's leading legal exegete, she is no stranger to exploiting some existing loopholes in the law — at times for herself, and sometimes for others.\nIt has been made clear often enough that Yanfei is not a stickler for the rules and has no wish to be shackled by strictures.\nStill, she contributes to the betterment of Liyue as she seeks her own pleasure, and will not use these loopholes for ill.\nWhen making amendments to legal loopholes each year, Ningguang the Tianquan will often study Yanfei's doings, as if she were Liyue's unofficial legal troubleshooter.\nIn a sense, one could argue that Yanfei makes the laws better at the lowest possible price... This principle is also the reason why she has never been convicted of exploiting any such loopholes.\nYanfei believes in \"no structure without laws,\" and what she wishes for is to \"live as one pleases without overstepping.\"\nEveryone in Liyue, adeptus or mortal, protects it in their own way.\nThat is why Yanfei possesses a Vision, one that is of equal weight to her principles."

            "Character Details\tThe adepti faithfully adhere to the contract that they have with Rex Lapis, and have thus defended Liyue for millennia.\nWhen danger arises in Liyue, the adepti are sure to come forth, and they do show up from time to time when the land is at peace.\nSometimes, they do so to punish those who harbor evil in their hearts, and sometimes they intervene to save the imprisoned. And if they happen to meet someone with a destiny intertwined with that of the adepti way, they will take them as disciples and teach them their arts.\nAmongst the adepti, Streetward Rambler is among those who interact more with mortals.\nShe has a great many disciples, the youngest of whom is named Yaoyao.\nYaoyao is both talented and inquisitive, and while she is still very young, thus limiting her ability to fully take in what she has been taught and causing no small amount of innocuous mistakes in the process, she will in time become a most knowledgeable girl.\nShe also possesses a gentle and caring nature, and she treats people with earnestness and generosity. Not only does her master favor her, but her senior disciple and other elders in her life, too, very much dote on her.\nMost will never have the fortune to enter the adepti abodes in Jueyun Karst, but Yaoyao comes and goes between them both freely and often. Indeed, the love she receives from the adepti at her young age is quite an enviable matter.",
            "Character Story 1\tAs the people of Liyue Harbor see it, Madame Ping is often found with Yaoyao by her side, the two seeming the very image of a loving grandmother and granddaughter.\nIn truth, however, there is no blood relation between them, and Yaoyao is Madame Ping's — or should we say Streetward Rambler's — disciple.\nWhen Yaoyao first became the adeptus' disciple, she was still too young to have learned to read and write, and so her master began by teaching her the etiquette of tomes of poetry on a daily basis.\nAs she grew, Streetward Rambler would gradually add the rites of the adepti, their methods of self-cultivation, and her own spear arts into Yaoyao's curriculum.\nThe voluminous nature of such teachings makes committing them to memory a challenge for Yaoyao, but her master does not overly fret about such things, for it is apparent to her that Yaoyao has indeed listened to those lessons.\nWhile her spear's shaft is heavy and ill-aligned to a child's easy wielding, Yaoyao practices every day nonetheless.\nAnd while books of poetry might be hard to memorize, she reads them daily nonetheless, to the point where she can expound on the relationship between full stomachs and righteousness in her sleep.\nHaving initially resolved to be a sterner taskmistress, Streetward Rambler was relieved to see Yaoyao's earnest attitude, and thus relaxed her requirements a little.\nThat Yaoyao genuinely treated her as her grandmother warmed the cockles of her heart greatly as well.\nIndeed, despite being half the height of an adult, Yaoyao tended to Streetward Rambler's meals and fretted over her health when the hotter parts of the year give way to the cold, as if forgetting that headaches and fevers were not common problems for the adepti.\nIndeed, Streetward Rambler came to feel as if she really had been blessed with a granddaughter, and from then on, she never said a strict word to the child ever again.\nWhile she had not begun this relationship with any intention apart from taking a disciple, she now finds herself and Yaoyao inseparable. Which is alright, she supposes. Let the little one stay by her side for some time yet — she still has much to teach, after all.",
            "Character Story 2\tThis story begins well before Yaoyao was even born. Her parents, preferring life out in the mountain wilds, chose to move away from Liyue Harbor and search for a quiet place near Qingce Village to live, building their own abode and living life in relative seclusion.\nThere they lived in solitude by the mountains and waters, and their backyard had a small field in which they grew melons, fruits, and vegetables.\nThe closest settlement to them was Qingce Village, and when they lacked for any daily necessities, they would bring the fruits of their field to the village and trade for what they required.\nThis was the home to which Yaoyao was born.\nThus did she gain the birds, beasts, and fish for companions while she was still a babbling babe, and thus did she take her first tottering steps in the radish field behind her house.\nHer gentle, pure soul was first cultivated in this quiet and cozy garden.\nLater, she would catch the eye of an adeptus and be taken in as her disciple.\nAt first, her parents were not entirely willing to let their daughter live long-term in Liyue Harbor with said adeptus, for they feared that their innocent daughter, having long been used to life in the mountains, would find herself led astray by the bright lights of the big city.\nBut Streetward Rambler's counsel ultimately brought them round:\n\"Perhaps solitude in the mountains shall indeed keep one from mortal stain, but such lonesomeness may not be what Yaoyao desires for her future. Let her have the chance to see the myriad faces of the world for herself.\"\nOnly then did her parents give her into the care of the adeptus, and time has only demonstrated the wisdom of that choice.\nIn Liyue Harbor, Yaoyao would become a much more outgoing person with the help of her master and a host of good friends. But when the festive season comes along, she does take leave of her master to see her parents at home.\nIndeed, if one desired a good teacher for one's child, could there be a more ideal pick than an adeptus?",
            "Character Story 3\tMadame Ping's old acquaintances will sometimes drop by to visit her, and during such times, Yaoyao will accompany her master and her master's guests in roaming the city.\nHaving come from afar, these guests will often not only visit the stores and food stands, but also attend storytelling sessions or Liyue opera performances at Heyu Tea House.\nOf course, being the large city that it is, Liyue Harbor has no lack of people who enjoy spending some downtime at the teahouse, including many outlanders who appreciate the cultures of other nations.\nOnce, three outlanders, first-time visitors to Liyue Harbor, sat at the table beside that of Yaoyao and company. Having heard an opera about the adepti of Liyue, they began to discuss that very topic over tea and snacks.\nUnable to get a word in lengthwise in the conversation between her master and her guest, Yaoyao succumbed to boredom, listening in on the nearby chat while eating some treats.\nThe lady from Inazuma seemed to think that Liyue's adepti were not much different from the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, having charge over matters divine and literary alike.\nThe visitor from Fontaine was of an obdurate view that the adepti were in the employ of the state apparatus. Had he met Ganyu, the Qixing's secretary before? Or did that nation simply have a similar arrangement?\nThe adventurer from Mondstadt was for his part very taken with the legends of the adepti, for he had only heard the bards sing songs of the gods, but had never himself met one or any of their familiars.\nUnable to resist, he asked the tea master if they had ever spoken to an adeptus, only to be disappointed by the reply:\n\"It is but a story, for we mortals do not daily dwell in Jueyun Karst, and few are the opportunities to meet the adepti.\"\nYaoyao, finding this statement to be incorrect, could not help but rebut thusly: \"That's not true. The adepti are among us. I mean, Uncle Moon Carver just said that the story was very interesting.\"\nFor some reason she could not fathom, Madame Ping's guest stopped speaking altogether, and Madame Ping laughed, saying a few words to the tea master to change the topic.\nYaoyao, however, did not understand: Why did people find the adepti very distant from their daily lives? The adepti were amongst them — they just didn't readily reveal themselves, that's all.",
            "Character Story 4\tNot all people can be accepted and taken as disciples by the adepti — only those whose destinies are entwined with these blessed beings may become privy to their arts and ways.\nYaoyao once asked her master: \"Why do you say that our destinies are entwined? What does that mean?\"\n\"It means that you and I have things in common that led to our meeting.\"\nThis answer, of course, was akin to some overarching axiom in a book, crushing much meaning into very few words, and has by no means been easy for Yaoyao to wrap her head around.\nYaoyao remembers that she had been playing in the mountains as usual when she first met her master.\nAt that time, she was still living with her parents, and when she went out to play, she would speak to the stones and the clouds about her feelings. In her eyes, the flowers, birds, fish, insects, and the mountains, rocks, and rivers were all her precious playmates.\nThat day, however, the stones and the clouds replied when she spoke, and thus overjoyed, she chatted with them throughout the entire day.\nThen the adeptus recalled her mystical arts, and the illusory stones and clouds dissipated, revealing Streetward Rambler to Yaoyao in her true form — and yet, Yaoyao was not startled.\nIt is the adepti way to protect the world and the people who live in it, and the adepti of Liyue do not merely defend humanity, but cherish also the things of nature. All such things are bound within their own natural cycles, and so long as one acts in concert with these cycles, all things will grow in their time and will not encroach upon one another.\nYaoyao's treasuring of her playmates bore similarity indeed to the adepti and their care for all things, and it was this that drew Streetward Rambler's interest.\nShame, then, that Yaoyao could not for the life of her comprehend the complexities of her master's reply, and thus did she lay the question aside for the time being.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter following her master to live in Liyue Harbor, Yaoyao has packed her daily schedule to the very gills. Her mornings are for readings and lessons, afternoons are for spear training, and afterward, it is time for single-minded play!\nPlay, her master said, is not to be underestimated, and for a child like Yaoyao, learning and play are both right and proper things to do.\nIt has been during play time that she has encountered all manner of people, among them the captain of the Crux Fleet, the doctor at Bubu Pharmacy, and his little herb-gathering assistant. As such, she has been steadily gaining a larger pool of people to ask about anything she may encounter that she might not immediately understand.\nShe also loves to explore the harbor area: Granny Shan's toy stall, the establishment — that is to say, Wanmin Restaurant — run by her senior disciple's family, the dockyards... If it may be explored, she would love to explore it.\nAs such, she has seen many things that books cannot tell of, such as the sails of embarking ships rippling in the wind, or the full map of Liyue that may be found in Yujing Terrace — each one of these helps her perceive the vastness of the world around her.\nSometimes, her idea of play will take her alongside her master to visit the Jueyun adepti. There she has heard many an ancient tale, and there she has learned that the truth of the past is far more perilous than any tomes may tell.\nEach day, she learns a little something more, and each day, things change all around her — nothing remains quite the same as it once was in life.\nThis is her favorite thing about Liyue Harbor.\nLife here is like a long river, constantly moving forward at a great pace.\nBy contrast, the days she spent with her parents are like a peaceful, quiet stream. The stream is wonderful, of course, and its gentle tread and slow rhythm has given her a great many warm memories.\nThe great river is also good. She will take up its unceasing drive and work hard to become an adult who both her master and parents can be proud of.\nAnd so wishing, she grows expectant, wishing to grow up.",
            "Yuegui\tStreetward Rambler has acquaintances all across Liyue, and even early on, she had paid many of them a visit, saying that her newest disciple's training was not quite complete yet, and asking them to take care of the young girl should they encounter her.\nHer original intention was simply to introduce her student and ask that they help teach Yaoyao further, that her eventual learning might increase.\nYaoyao's clever and caring manner, however, proved more lovable than Streetward Rambler had expected, and Cloud Retainer would take the request to heart.\nBefore either master or pupil had realized it, Cloud Retainer had already completed the creation of a wondrous machine rabbit.\n\"Well then, Yaoyao, one purposes to give this to you. Should you encounter any danger, call upon it, and it shall answer.\"\nYaoyao was very taken with this cute rabbit, naming it Yuegui and taking it everywhere with her.\nHaving given this gift, Cloud Retainer would seek out the little girl's master to say, and not without pride, that:\n\"One should inform you first that this device has another function. Should you ever be unable to find Yaoyao, you need only call out, 'Yuegui!', and her location shall be made known to you.\"\n\"Nonetheless, one counsels you not to overuse this feature, for when the child grows older, she will desire her own privacy, and may yet take umbrage to your constant calling upon her. Now, take one's loose relationship with one's pupil Shenhe for example...\"\n\"Oh, not to worry. I understand, Cloud Retainer.\"\n\"And it is good that you do. In any case, Yuegui shall alert us if anyone should try to do her ill without our knowledge — any such churls shall soon need all the luck they can get.\"",
            "Vision\t\"Why did I receive a Vision?\"\nThis question troubled Yaoyao quite a bit in the days that directly followed her receiving one.\nDid the gods want to reward her for the good deeds she had done? Or was this because she had been a good and respectful pupil?\nSpeaking of which, her senior Xiangling and Aunty Cloud Retainer's student Shenhe both had Visions as well. So, was this because the gods recognized the adepti, and so they would, as a matter of course, also extend this acknowledgment to an adeptus' students?\nBut on further consideration, none of these guesses really made much sense.\nIt was with a sigh that Yaoyao found herself sitting on the slopes behind Liyue Harbor, hugging a dog that had followed her up the incline.\nThis was hardly the first thing she had found incomprehensible since leaving her parents' side, and she had, by and large, decided that her doubts were unavoidable, and could wait till she got older, for surely they might clear up by then!\nBut since she now had a Vision, an item that represented divine acknowledgment, she could not betray such hopes.\nAs a disciple of her master, she would follow her example and protect the people. This meant that she would not only have to care for her master and senior disciple, but also extend care to her family and friends, and extend universal love to all people. Ah, she still had such a long way to go. Nothing for it, then — she'd hang on for a bit longer during spear practice tomorrow, and write one extra page into her calligraphy copybook too."

            "Character Details\tLiyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs is an organization marked by transparency — from ordinary staff members of the Eight Trades to prominent officials of Yujing Terrace, every employee has their basic information documented in the Ministry's lists.\nYelan, despite claiming to work for the Ministry, is the sole exception. Most of her colleagues have never heard of her, nor is her name anywhere to be found on any rosters.\nThis does say something about her character — elusive, enigmatic, and erratic.\nShe is a ghost who walks in the middle of many crises under various names. But before the storms can come to an end, she has already disappeared without a trace.\nSometimes, she will pick a side in some conflict to offer her help, but those who receive her aid would be fools to celebrate prematurely, for they soon find that the same help has been extended to their opponents.\nHaving stepped into her trap, many have vowed to take revenge, yet none are able to tell what she is planning, let alone know where she stands.\nMany believe that she is a spy who works for some mysterious organization, and that her forte is stirring things up in the dark, which she then relies on to attain what she wants.\nSome even go as far as saying that she is a frenetic follower of disorder who neither serves any organization nor holds any meaningful purposes.\nEven if she does, all she wants is to add fuel to the already spreading flame and drag everyone down into a world of madness created by her.\nWith so many theories and guesses circulating, she has become a mystery. As for the truth, you could only hope to get an answer from Yelan herself.\nBut unfortunately, this is no easy task either — for it is always she who finds you when she wishes to, not the other way around.",
            "Character Story 1\tPharmacies in Liyue Harbor occasionally receive curious patients.\nOn some days, it might be a Sumeru mercenary, on other days, a Fontaine adventurer, and there might even be some Mondstadt fisher who accidentally fell into water and bumped her head against a rock...\nThese people are of different ages, statuses, and origins, but there is something equally peculiar to them, that is, they all share a slight addiction to pain.\nThey like the stinging sensation when pharmacists apply herbal remedies to their wounds and enjoy the dull pain caused by pressure on their bruises.\nThey even seem to care little if anesthetic is used or not when they are put through painful therapies.\nSurprised by their extraordinary endurance, novice pharmacists are sufficiently distracted, such that they fail to notice that all their patients are actually the same person.\nThey are, all of them, Yelan in disguise. A master in this art, she always manages to avoid attention.\nAs for the wounds on her person, these are the inevitable result of her constant exposure to danger from mission to mission.\nDespite the curious job, Yelan herself is not very curious about the world.\nShe eats, sleeps, and lives just like everyone else, but few things can really pique her interest.\nShe is well-read, but she is no avid reader. She always knows what to say to achieve the best result, yet she takes no pleasure in playing mind games.\nShe travels far and roams the lands, yet the traveling and roaming are bland to her.\nIn Yelan's eyes, these things are not hobbies, but a means to an end.\nShe even prefers to roll the dice to decide how she will pass the time.\nJust as someone who is so used to spicy food might lose the ability to enjoy ordinary dishes, Yelan finds that only spicy cuisine can bring her satisfaction.\n\"Blandness is synonymous with blindness, while thrills afford clarity.\"\nActing upon said philosophy, she chooses an acute style of life, venturing into many places while hiding in the shadows.\nShe dances with danger, secrets, and a strong sense of achievement — these are the vivid proof of her existence.",
            "Character Story 2\tShorn of her masks, Yelan is a special intelligence officer who reports directly to the Tianquan Ningguang.\nThe title itself is not entirely accurate, for it only covers the scope of her work but not her relationship with the Tianquan.\nDeep in her heart, Yelan does not think of herself as anyone's subordinate. The way she sees it, she is not so much working for Ningguang as making good on her end of the deal, or rather... she is honoring a certain pact.\nShe plucks the fruits of intelligence from the tree of danger for Ningguang, and in return, all she asks for is danger itself and the sense of achievement.\nNone know when their collaboration began.\nThe only thing certain is that Yelan has long made her presence felt in lands outside Liyue.\nFrom other nations in Teyvat to even the perilous Abyss...\nEvery secret and perilous demesne shall become a garden where orchids bloom.\nStealthily she roams the night, stars shining upon her in the skies.",
            "Character Story 3\tYelan spends much of her time patrolling and roaming The Chasm, where she often stares into the darkness deep below.\nHer family's history dates far back into an ancient age, and her ancestors once fought in The Chasm against a great cataclysm.\nWanton death was dealt during that battle, and even a yaksha met their end there. Only a few survived the grueling bloodshed.\nOne of her ancestors died, while the other went insane, constituting a huge blow to her family.\nYelan has always wanted to find out what happened back then. Despite her better judgment, she can't help feeling attracted to The Chasm.\nIt almost feels like something that runs in her blood — something inexplicably ominous — has been summoning her to The Chasm.\nPerhaps she will plunge into that darkness one day, and the ill fate that once befell her ancestors shall find her too.\nThe ominous calling that runs in the family shuts down her fear and turns on her craving for danger. This may be the reason for the peculiarities in her character, Yelan presumed.\nShe had never doubted it until she came of age, until the seal on The Chasm was lifted.\nWith the help of her companions, she unveiled the hidden past of her ancestors.\nThat moment marked a new chapter in her life:\nIn the past, she was a wild beast driven by pure instinct. Drawn to danger, she walked into darkness.\nFrom that moment on, she has found the true meaning of her instinct.\nThat which hides inside her, that constant calling, is not only a source of worry but also a light of guidance.\nIt is the blood of heroes which has been howling for 500 years.\nShe has no fear, for the courage within her makes her strong. She craves danger, for the heir of heroes is meant for a great adventure.\nSome day, she will embark on the path her ancestors once took.\nShe is the descendant of heroes, and she shall become the hero for many who will come after her.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe Ministry of Civil Affairs has a Special Attention List.\nThe list isn't long, but everyone on it is truly extraordinary:\nFor instance, the unbound and forthright leader of the armed fleet and the capable outland traveler with a broad range of skills.\nThe list even includes some reclusive adepti in Liyue whose names still bear great weight today...\nThese people could easily bring storms upon Liyue, their intentions notwithstanding.\nAs such, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, ever on guard against risk, still watches them closely.\nOn top of that, there is also a more classified Secret Intelligence List.\nThose on it are the real threats to Liyue.\nSo who are they exactly?\nThe Fatui Harbingers? Figures from the Abyss Order?\nOr perhaps, are even the names of gods listed there?\nOther than the Qixing, Yelan is likely to be the only one who can answer these questions, for she is the very person who compiled the two lists.\nThe results of such work please her greatly, and day after day, she perfects the lists, as crows embellishing their nests with shining trinkets.\nThat said, while both are equally obsessed with collecting, Yelan must sweat and even bleed to secure what she is after, while crows need only flap their wings to achieve their aim.\nFortunately, this does not bother her at all, for she believes that the intelligence is worth whatever cost she is going to pay.\nOne day, the information will come in handy — Liyue will never plunge into disaster without any clue of the danger like it once did 500 years ago.\nShe will see to it that Liyue is not caught unprepared.",
            "Character Story 5\tDon't play dice at Yanshang Teahouse.\nIf you can't help yourself, play with someone you know.\nIf a lady whom you've never seen before invites you to a game, just ignore her.\nHeed this earnest advice from veteran gamblers.\nDo not try your luck with that terrifying woman unless you want to have a gloomy day.\nThe invincible lady of Yanshang Teahouse is none other than Yelan herself, and one of her guises is that of the owner of this teahouse.\nA while ago when she came back from abroad, Liyue had just weathered the Osial crisis, and the Fatui who had occupied Yanshang Teahouse were now largely out of the game.\nYelan seized the opportunity to take it over, turning the teahouse into a secret base.\nOn the one hand, with people from all walks of life to be found here, the teahouse serves as an ideal source of intel. On the other hand, as Yelan has no issue with occasionally giving herself a break, she will pretend to be a regular customer, drinking some tea and playing a few rounds of some game.\nEvery round of finger-guessing is a tiny adventure, and every roll of dice sends sporadic thrills down her spine. Even the smallest challenge is something she can never get enough of.\nAs an intelligence operative, Yelan takes pride in her skills — she is confident that she can read her opponents' eyes and roll the dice such that they fall outside the rules but well within her designs.\nIf there is a draw, that could only mean one thing: Her opponents are cheating too.\nDon't try to reason with her. The very concept of \"reasoning\" is simply foreign to the Yanshang Teahouse, nor does it exist in Yelan's vocabulary.\nBe good and choose between the pain of losing and the disgrace of cheating.\nYou want to have neither, huh? Then why don't you turn the clock back to the very beginning? \nDon't play dice at Yanshang Teahouse!",
            "The Fascinating Bracelet and the Whitesilk Mantle\tThroughout Yelan's intelligence career so far, there has been one memorable operation that fuses both failure and success together.\nOne could say that it was a failure because she lost a family heirloom named the \"Fascinating Bracelet\" during that operation.\nThe inside of the jade bracelet is engraved with a spell passed through her line that turns the heirloom into a simple communication device. However, the spell requires a pair of such vessels to work. Now that only one bracelet is left, it is no more than a mere accessory.\nHowever, the operation also proved a success for Yelan because her enemy did not get the upper hand, either. And this enemy of hers was no ordinary character — it was none other than \"Regrator,\" Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers.\nYelan infiltrated a secret trade route that was run by Regrator behind the scenes, intercepting the goods and picking the most precious one of them as compensation for her bracelet.\nNow, there once existed a strange mystical beast in times of old. A robe made from its fur would be worth a fortune, and due to its rarity, such a robe is exceptionally hard to procure.\nIn fact, the beast is so powerful that although it died centuries ago, its body remains intact today, and its fur still emits a mysterious fragrance.\nRegrator had intended it as an offer to the Tsaritsa, yet Yelan unexpectedly intercepted it.\nNot only that, she also rejected the style that Snezhnayans had chosen for their Tsaritsa — she yanked the fur off, combined it with Liyue's Ramie yarn, and made a rather fashionable sleeved mantle for herself.\nThis series of happenings could be seen as significant or insignificant — depending on one's perspective. Ultimately, it all boils down to three words: gains and losses.\nThe cycle of gaining and losing is a rather accurate summary of Yelan's life.\nNone of that really bothers her though. Instead, she takes immense pleasure from it.",
            "Vision\tYelan wasn't always on her own. Many years ago, she once had a team who watched each others' backs.\nThere were a small group of people who for various reasons chose to tread a path in the dark with her.\nBut back then, Yelan had not yet realized that her clever tricks and ingenious traps, the skills that she took pride in, could not solve everything for her.\nEnemies with a strong sense of self-control would not bite her bait, opponents with cunning and calculating minds would not fall for her schemes, and those with overwhelming power would simply strong-arm their way out of her traps.\nTherefore, Yelan and her team paid the price — one by one, they perished along the way, though they had long foreseen and prepared themselves for such a fate...\nStill, after a mission to investigate the Abyss, Yelan eventually found herself left alone. For the first time in her life, she stopped, for a long, long time.\nThis state of affairs persisted until one day, when Ningguang visited her in her wood hut personally.\n\"You haven't been back to Liyue Harbor for a while. Something must've happened. I can understand if you want to quit.\"\nNingguang stood outside the door, with a serious look on her face but her voice still casual and relaxed.\n\"But it's alright. I work with those I trust, and I trust those I work with. I'm willing to believe that you're here trying to find a way out. All postures, aggressive or defensive, are all means to an end, anyway.\"\nThere was no response, but only a suffocating silence. A long time passed before Ningguang finally heard an answer from behind her:\n\"We both made a mistake: We shouldn't have involved ordinary folk in what we do.\"\n\"Ordinary folk?\"\nEven as Ningguang was formulating thoughts, a flash of blue shot towards her, stopping as it passed her by.\nIn a display of great control from the archer, the arrow quickly shattered into pearls of water and broke into glistening shards of light before touching the ground.\nNingguang turned around and saw Yelan walking up, a bow in hand, blood dripping down from her fingertips.\nOne could only imagine the days and nights of grueling training in archery Yelan had gone through for all her fingers to bleed.\nKnowing Yelan well, Ningguang also understood that she must have been through an uncommonly tough situation. Only that could explain Yelan's uncommon determination to lock herself up for this grueling re-training.\nYelan aimed at the mountain in the distance, a gesture that was also an answer to Ningguang.\nShe released the arrow. Like lightning it shot into the skies, piercing through clouds with might that could shatter the dome of heaven itself. As if responding to the call of an unknown power, waters in the mountains growled and howled, then swirled their way upward in the form of countless arrows.\nWhen they met halfway in the sky, they exploded into a curtain of water, bringing down a squalling shower like those that adorned summer nights.\nAs the sky cleared, there was no rainbow, no butterflies to be seen, only a faint pillar of light that fell into Yelan's palm.\nAccording to Ningguang, the Vision carries a message: \"From today onward, leave all matters to the extraordinary Yelan.\""

            "Something to Share: Cycles\t\"When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence.\" Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite.",
            "Something to Share: Spots of Light\tDid you ever try to step on a spot of light before as a child? You know, those patches on the ground created when the sunlight passes through the leaves. I once thought that it would disappear if I stepped on it, but it would always jump onto my foot instead. I tried and tried and tried, but I never succeeded...

I never thought that it would actually work, but I guess wonders never cease.",

I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.",
            "About the Raiden Shogun\tFireworks are probably the furthest thing from the \"eternity\" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has \"eternity\" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.",

I ask him for help whenever I encounter a matter I can't settle.",
            "About Yae Miko\tAyaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, \"isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?\" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?",
            "About Arataki Itto: Duels\tOh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?",
            "About Arataki Itto: Arataki's Gang\tArataki's gang? Huh!? So he isn't just someone with too much free time on his hands?",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tPeople with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery. They talk of flowers and birds, wind and moon, but never about the reality that confronts them. He's got quite the tale to tell, I'm sure.",
            "About Kujou Sara\tDue to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture.

            "Character Details\tYoimiya's name is renowned throughout Hanamizaka.\nShe is the most skilled pyrotechnician in Inazuma and is known as the \"Queen of the Summer Festival.\"\nYoimiya, who has inherited the mantle of \"Naganohara,\" is able to give people an unparalleled experience with her ever-changing and spectacular fireworks.\nIn addition to being a craftsperson, she is also the \"heroic sister\" in the eyes of many children. No matter how big the problem is, Yoimiya always has a solution to save the day.\nBe it the illusions of fear or the shadows of cold reality, they will all dissipate under the starlight magic of Yoimiya's fireworks.\nThe children are not the only ones she helps — as long as one is willing to talk to her about their troubles, she will lend a helping hand, and try her best to help them through the crisis.\nSplendid fireworks, warm starlight and passionate lights all join in a swirling dance in Yoimiya's hands. Her bright smile is always able to inspire fellow travelers and light up the way for them.",
            "Character Story 1\tTo Inazumans, fireworks symbolize summer.\nThe various festivals that take place at fixed times feature a rotation of various events, with fireworks being the sole constant.\nOver a century ago, the Yashiro Commission once organized a dazzling fireworks display with \"commemoration\" as the theme.\nThe fireworks then were made by the greatest pyrotechnicians in the land, and this was the origin of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.\nIn latter days, fireworks would become more common, and the Naganohara Fireworks Show would slowly become an event in which all people would participate.\nDuring the Fireworks Show, everyone can light their favorite fireworks, and the owner of the Naganohara Fireworks store will pick an appropriate time to set up a most lavish performance.\nThe year Yoimiya took over, her first fiesta was already jaw-droppingly good.\nOn the night before that Fireworks Show, Kamisato Ayaka enjoined Yoimiya thusly: \"Her Excellency will be watching this fireworks display personally. As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem — the Electro Mitsudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would.\"\n\"Haha, just wait for it!\" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.\nBefore the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.\nYet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.\nIt was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an \"angling\" trick added to it.\nIf viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.\nOf course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.\nWith Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, \"Queen of the Summer Festival,\" coined.",
            "Character Story 2\tNaganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always in full swing. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.\nHowever, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.\nIf chatting with the guest is her way of \"understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted,\" then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...\nYoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.\nShe doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.\nHer neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.\nWhat she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.\nAfter taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.\nYoimiya puts it this way: \"I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!\"",
            "Character Story 3\tCraftsmen seeking perfection are often rigorous and self-disciplined, but Yoimiya is an exception, acting freely and taking unscheduled breaks.\nSometimes, she even has to work late into the night when she misses her daytime work due to chatting for too long. But when the sun begins to rise, she will climb up to the heights to see the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment at having finished her work in her heart. Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...\nHer neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.\nFortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.\nAt some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.\nPerhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.\nLiving as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.\nOf course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations. Mistakes shall not be made during these all-important performances — her \"official business.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tApart from selling fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells various intricate knickknacks. This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.\nAll manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.\nFrom the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.\nThey are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared his nemesis.\nYoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys. With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.\nMany people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, \"Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all,\" she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too — everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all.",
            "Character Story 5\t\"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.\"\nThis nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.\nAs such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.\nYoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the \"rainbows\" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them \"sufficiently shiny,\" whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.\nIndeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.\nBut it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that \"rainbows\" could indeed be exchanged for \"fireworks.\"\nThough some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.\n\"The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures.\"\nThe legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...\nPerhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.\nThe children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.\nYoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.",
            "Yoimiya's Candy Box: \"Sweet Pearl\"\tEvery festival, Yoimiya not only tries snacks from every store, but she also collects all sorts of candies, wrapping them up with care before storing them away inside a small candy box.\nYoimiya's candy box is a small crimson ball that has been decorated with delicate lanyards and ornate accessories, much like the hair accessories she often wears.\nEach time she encounters a joyous event, she will take one candy out of the box and eat it. If her friends or the children are around, she will share the sweets with them.\nYoimiya's neighbors often mistake her hair ornaments for the candy box, hence its erroneous nickname \"Sweet Pearl.\"\nThe speed at which the box lightens is taken as an important measure of happiness.\nThe quicker it empties, the more pleased Yoimiya is.\nSometimes, when things get busy, she sometimes absently uses the candy box as a hair accessory, realizing her mistake only after the day is done.\nStill, even this error would inspire Yoimiya. From then on, she would wear them interchangeably.\n\"Take a guess: does my hair ornament have candy in it today? Free pick of the sweets to anyone who gets it right!\"",
            "Vision\tYoimiya is always up for a chat. It is only when the fireworks are ascending into the skies that she quiets down and just watches the lovely scenery.\nPeople often say that fireworks come and go in a fleeting heartbeat, but if they are memorable enough, they will remain in bloom forever in people's hearts.\nThose who accompanied you and the loveliness of the moment itself, will burrow deep into your mind as a beautiful memory.\nAnd as you look upon the same fireworks, many years later, that same memory and the feelings that came with it will surely rise again to the forefront of your heart.\nIs this not also \"Eternity\"?\nThe special firework formula slips that belong solely to the Naganohara family exist for precisely this purpose.\nBy incorporating goodwill and wishes into the gorgeous fireworks, ephemeral things are etched into eternity. This is the meaning of Yoimiya's line of work.\nOn one summer night following her taking over Naganohara Fireworks, Yoimiya could not sleep, and thus she continued in her research till daylight came.\nSuddenly, she heard a tinkling sound, and a burning-red object fell into an unused launching tube.\nAt first, Yoimiya used her Vision as a sort of lighter. Fortunately, her father discovered it and explained a Vision's significance to her.\nSo, this tiny gem could grant a person astonishing and mysterious powers. And yet what else could it do other than protect the children or chase some mischievous monsters away?\n\"Even if it could have other uses,\" Yoimiya thought, \"it may not ever need to do these things in my hands. I'm just someone who pursues happiness, a fireworks-maker who enjoys living life.\"\nTime has flown since then, and Yoimiya has grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of \"fire,\" with her skill at making fireworks having likewise increased.\nSometimes, she stops to ask herself this: \"How did someone as ordinary as me receive the acknowledgment of the gods? Do the gods... enjoy fireworks, by any chance?\""

            "Character Details\tHeyu Tea House has been a popular leisure spot for the people of Liyue.\nIts business thrives on two things, one of them being its boss Fan Er'ye's business acumen in inviting a top-notch Tea Master who tells the best stories of all.\nBesides that, there is also the performance of the acclaimed troupe, Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Its director and soul — a famed opera singer named Yun Jin — takes the stage at the tea house from time to time.\nWhile one can always get delicious delicacies or good storytelling as long as one knows where to look, Yun Jin's performance does not just await one there.\nAs a result, you can always find fans of Yun Jin trying their luck at Heyu Tea House. While waiting for Yun Jin's performance, they discuss her past performances and how they feel about them.\nAs such, more people frequent the tea house, with nine out of ten of them being Yun Jin's fans.\nFan Er'ye couldn't be more satisfied with this state of affairs.",
            "Character Story 1\tLiyue Opera is one of the traditional arts of Liyue that has been passed down for generations.\nLiyue Opera enjoys a long history, and it has gone through quite some changes from what it was originally created to be.\nThe good thing is, the Liyue Opera we see now retains the sophisticated-sounding vocals and richly varied melodies of old.\nLiyue Opera performers usually perform in troupes, and the most acclaimed one of them is the Yun-Han Opera Troupe.\nFor generations, the troupe has been run by the historic house of Yun, and its current director is a prominent figure in Liyue Harbor — the opera singer Yun Jin.\nYun Jin made her name at a young age when she stunned her audience with a sweet voice and lively costumes in her debut performance.\nThe more she performs, the better-honed her animated and dynamic style becomes.\nWhether it's a delicate and dignified young lady or a mighty and honorable heroine, she can play any role.\nWhat's even rarer is that this young actress is also a playwright. Other than \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation,\" the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has performed many other new plays in recent years, all of which were written by Yun Jin.\nWith her superb skill, it is no wonder why long-time opera fans often visit Heyu Tea House to ask about Yun Jin's performance schedule when their starving ears demand good opera singing.",
            "Character Story 2\tYun Jin was born in a family of Liyue Opera performers.\nHer father is a playwright, and her mother used to be a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, taking up the mantle from Yun Jin's grandfather.\nIn such an environment, Yun Jin was exposed to Liyue Opera at a very early age, often amusing herself by echoing her mother's singing.\nA childhood hobby, as many would tend to believe, seems unlikely to be developed into a lifelong career, yet Yun Jin proved to be an exception.\nShe was serious about it and insisted on learning the art.\nHer parents were delighted to see their daughter's determination and imparted everything they knew about the Liyue Opera to her. As such, Yun Jin started learning the opera early.\nHowever, Liyue Opera is a complex art that takes years of perfection to master.\nSo even for a child as gifted as Yun Jin, what awaited her was sweat and tears. While ordinary children might shy away from the pain of hamstring stretches and the tedium of memorizing lyrics, little Yun Jin hung tough and became quite accomplished.\nBy the time she finished all the subjects in Liyue Opera, veterans of Yun-Han Opera Troupe who watched her grow up couldn't help but exclaim,\n\"Yet another rising opera star is about to shine upon Liyue Harbor!\"",
            "Character Story 3\tMany veterans of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe first joined the troupe when Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge.\nThey have remained committed since Yun Jin took the troupe over.\nTheir love for the art of Liyue Opera is so deep — perhaps even to an excessive degree — that they frown upon any other forms of music performance, including rock 'n' roll.\nYun Jin, however, thinks otherwise. She finds that rock 'n' roll vibrates with vigor and even became friends with the rock 'n' roll musician Xinyan.\nElders of the troupe are glad to follow Yun Jin's lead during rehearsals, but when it comes to daily life, they treat her like their little granddaughter.\n\"Sweetie, listen to us. No spicy food, it hurts your voice. Meat is fine, but refrain from eating too much, or you will put on weight.\"\n\"If you really can't help yourself, have more shrimp. Stay away from the... roll 'n' roll thing. All they know is yelling.\"\nThese caring elders will nag Yun Jin about attending rock 'n' roll performance for hours on end.\nFaced with the impossible mission of persuading stubborn granddads and grannies, Yun Jin has to be creative.\nWhile it's not an option to go to Xinyan's performance, it's perfectly acceptable to visit Fan Er'ye's adopted daughter Xingyan and discuss Liyue Opera with her.\nThe elders are not fond of the rock star Xinyan, but they have taken a shine to Xingyan the adopted daughter of Fan Er'ye.\n\"I've heard that Xingyan can cook and do embroidery. She must be a polite and accomplished young lady. Yun Jin may be able to pick up a thing or two from hanging out with her. How capital!\"\nYun Jin has long got Fan Er'ye to agree on the details concerning the made-up Xingyan, so don't worry. No one's gonna call her out on this!",
            "Character Story 4\tYun Jin goes by many names. To some, she is Director Yun, and to others, Sir Yun.\nThey call her Director Yun for her leadership of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Though there are managers to help with everyday work, Yun Jin is the one who makes the big decisions. She thus earned the name of Director Yun from people in business circles.\nAs for Sir Yun, that is another story.\nWhen Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, long-time fans respectfully addressed him as Sir Yun. After Yun Jin took charge later, these fans frequented her performances as well.\nThere was once after a show when an impressed fan half-joked with others, \"the Sir Yun we have now sings rather well too.\"\nA voice from the crowd immediately countered by saying: \"How can you address a young girl as Sir?\"\nUpon hearing this, Yun Jin curved her lips.\n\"Those who were born early, learn early. They are naturally better-informed than others. It's every bit right for them to be referred to as Sirs.\"\n\"But one doesn't have to be old to be knowledgeable. Besides, why can't a girl be knowledgeable?\"\n\"You are quick in mind and speech, and are thus qualified to be called Sir. I have answered your eminent question — that also makes me a Sir.\"\nHer remarks impressed the fans present, who shared this story to many. In the end, everyone followed the trend and started to call her Sir Yun whether they had or had not met her in person.",
            "Character Story 5\tMany traditional Liyue Operas revolve around the theme of the adepti and Rex Lapis himself.\nA prime example would be \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation.\" People are full of wonderful fantasies about the adepti and would like to see the representation of their joy and anger on stage. Thus, stories portraying them make up the majority of the repertoire of Liyue Opera.\nWhen Yun Jin was young, she would find these stories engaging, but having exhausted every adeptal legend in her performing career, her take on theming gradually changed.\nWhy not experiment with other themes? For instance... stories of our own, perhaps?\nStories that tell of our earthly joys and sorrows, songs that sing of the hatreds and passions of humanity.\nMaybe these stories of mere mortals may not make it as classics of Liyue Opera, but there will always be some people who remember them.\nIn love our thoughts linger, in rage our hearts burn, and in obsession, our minds go astray. These emotions, good or bad, lift the veil that covers our feelings and souls.\nYun Jin is no adeptus. She can never put herself in the shoes of the adepti, yet she is endowed with the most accurate and sensitive grasp of human emotions.\n\"So, let me sing of human stories. May my brush be the brush of all hearts and my voice the voice of all souls.\"\nThis is the unspoken wish that Yun Jin has so far only kept to herself.",
            "Longevity Lock\tHer ancestors used to work as weaponsmiths instead of opera performers.\nLater, someone in the family who was tired of weapon forging grew an interest in the performing arts. By the time it came to Yun Jin's generation, few of the Yuns still practiced the art of forging.\nMany forged things have been passed down, though. The lock-shaped copper pendant that Yun Jin carries with her is one such item.\nIn her childhood, she often practiced dancing for a whole day under the scorching heat of the sun. Sometimes, she would even faint from the exhaustion.\nHer parents' hearts ached for her, but they knew well that she had to go through such things to lay a solid foundation.\nSo instead of stopping her, they gave Yun Jin the lock in the hopes that it would keep fortune and health within her.\nSince then, the lock has never left Yun Jin's side. Before every performance, it is a routine for Yun Jin to reminisce about those days of bittersweet training by cleaning the lock with great care.\nIt feels as if she was caressing the devoted heart of the little Yun Jin who was learning the opera.",
            "Vision\tShortly after Yun Jin's debut, Yun Jin quickly got the hang of stage performance through dozens of shows and her great intelligence.\nAt the time, her appearance meant a whole night of applause for a performance. However, the more she played, the more she felt at a loss — these were not the operas she wanted to perform.\nIn every opera, the pitch and tempo would invariably go either up or down to indicate drama or doldrum.\nAs time passed by, the visage of the various characters seemed to blend and blur.\nThe music would come on, followed by a neat dance, and then her sweet voice. The girl in \"The Divine Damsel of Devastation\" seemed no different from the fisherman's daughter in \"String of Pearls.\"\nWhile the audience did not object, Yun Jin was not satisfied. \"Is skillful singing and dancing all it takes to tell a moving tale?\"\nWhat broke her bottleneck was an opera named \"Snow Treading.\"\nIt was a monodrama about a strenuous walk in the snow. It happened to be a snowy day when Yun Jin first performed the opera.\nHaving gone astray in the snow, the character felt lost and lamented her helplessness. Somehow, the snow in the story seemed to fall into reality. Yun Jin, who had also found herself adrift, felt as if she had become her character.\nThat was what she had been looking for, the feeling of leaving herself behind and walking in the shoes of the many characters she played.\nTo breathe, to live, and to smile just like them.\nThat was the opera she had wanted to sing, the story she had wanted to tell — one about true emotions, a world built on tens of thousands of individuals who live lives of their own.\nYun Jin could no longer recall how she returned backstage after the epiphany. All she knew was that when she finally had time to take off her costume, she found a Vision in her sleeve."

However, Hu Tao, the current owner of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, primarily focuses on the art of sending mortals on their way.\nFor the various ceremonies for sending adepti off, Hu Tao usually employs the help of a friend in more or less the same business. That person's name is Zhongli. The adepti have been with Liyue for millennia, but only a handful have ascended in the past three thousand years, which means that everything regarding the traditions now only exists in texts. This is not something one would likely witness twice in their entire lifetime.\nNot even the most particular and learned of researchers or scholars could find one fault in Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's ceremonies for sending adepti off.\nEverything must be perfect, from the costumes, the time, the place, the items, the weather, the scheduled length, the size of the permitted audience, to the stature, profession, and age of said audience. Nothing can be overlooked.\nWhen folk describe Zhongli as \"living history,\" the latter usually only smiles and sighs.\n\"I... just have a good memory.\"",

He is also more than capable of participating in discussions on commerce, politics, and international relations.\nBut on a typical day, all you will glean from him is a few pieces of useless trivia, because he particularly enjoys sharing these fun tidbits with you.",

Half the stated cost is a good place to start.\nBut when Zhongli pays up (or rather, calls for someone else to pay up on his behalf), he never looks at the price tag. As long as it catches his eye, Zhongli will pay as much as the owner asks. Indeed, he will even buy it at a premium sometimes.\nBut for some reason, Zhongli always forgets to bring money.\nFor small purchases, he has friends to help him out, and large bills he somehow finds ways to have written off.\nTo those merchants who secretly pride themselves on their powers of flattery, Zhongli is a man of strange proclivities: in truth, he knows a great deal about the value of money and finance, and he also understands the suffering of the people. However, he seems to not understand that poverty is part of the human condition.\nOr perhaps it might be said that he cannot imagine himself being poor.\nHow has such a person not died of hunger yet?",
            "Character Story 3\tThere is no way Zhongli can starve.\nSuch concerns as profit and loss are beneath his notice. The Seven Nations and the world itself are where his efforts are directed.\nAs for wealth... He is wealth itself.\nHe is Morax, the overlord Rex Lapis who rules Liyue, and the Geo Archon of the Seven Archons. The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat, Mora, is named after him.\nWhen night falls and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his own hands.\nTo the people of Liyue, Rex Lapis has many divine titles.\nWhen he laid down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of Commerce.\nHe has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historians call him the God of History.\nThousands of years ago, the forebears of the citizens of Liyue Harbor struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create stoves. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.\nPeople from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.\nBut in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most fascinating.\nThe delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a warrior... Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited by their deity at some point — and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history.",
            "Character Story 4\tAs the founder of Liyue Harbor, \"contracts\" are the most important thing to Morax.\nFrom simple monetary exchange and agreements between merchants to the ancient laws that Morax himself laid down, there is no part of city life untouched by \"contracts.\"\nTo merchants, \"contracts\" are the most important standard to which they hold themselves: deadlines, invoices, shipping destinations... Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.\nThus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.\nThrough the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as \"permissible if unaddressed,\" and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.\nAmid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.\nThe person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the \"Tailor of Liyue,\" in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.\nBut no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.\n\"The one who reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tRex Lapis, most ancient of The Seven, has lived far too long.\nRex Lapis still remembers that moment when the final archon took their divine seat, thus ending the Archon War and the era of warring gods. The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding humanity.\nAs time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.\nThe carefree Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest of The Seven.\nWhen Barbatos first came to Liyue, Rex Lapis believed his fellow archon to have encountered some terrible crisis in pursuit of their duties, thus requiring his aid.\nSo when Barbatos descended in a gust of wind, the Geo Archon had already prepared himself to receive this neighboring deity and lend what help he may.\nBut as he looked, the Anemo Archon tossed a wine bottle at him.\n\"Here's some wine from Mondstadt. Care for a taste?\"\nTo forsake one's duty to deliver a single bottle of wine — what a preposterous notion!\nYet the Anemo Archon kept coming to visit, to explore Liyue Harbor, all sorts of strange questions on his lips. The Anemo Archon's questions knew as little limits as the wine in his hands.\nFrom then on, the first Seven would often gather in Liyue.\nRex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.\nThe world has changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory.\nThe seven seats changed and again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.\nNor would the duty of guiding humanity be honored by the new archons.\nEven the hardest rocks may be worn down after three thousand years.\nNor would the wind ever return again.\nOne drizzly day, the ancient ruler was strolling about Liyue Harbor, and overheard a merchant telling one of his workers,\n\"You've finished your duties, go ahead and call it a day.\"\nLong did he stand amidst the milling crowd.\n\"Have I... already finished my duties?\"",
            "That Which Rises From the Sea\tDuring the Archon Wars, every corner of Teyvat was consumed in the fires of conflict. Not only did gods fight amongst themselves, but countless wicked things also sought to expand their domains.\nOne such type of creature caused no end of woe for the Geo Archon, long before he took that title along with his place among The Seven.\nThese foul creatures, straight from the murky depths of the ocean abyss, had a squishy exterior, and possessed agile tentacles that would live on even after being cut off, even secreting some thick and revolting fluid in the process.\nThis alone would have been enough to make them the most monstrous of all creatures, and still it was not the pinnacle of their monstrosity.\nWhat made them so truly terrible was their small size, which gave them the ability to duck into unimaginably small nooks and crannies.\nNo space was too narrow for them, neither the wooden boards of tables and chairs, nor the seams of windows and doors and curtain folds, nor even books and brushes.\nMany a poor soul had, on at least one occasion, unwittingly outstretched their hand, only to quickly retract it in horror with a blood-curdling scream at the sensation of something cold, clammy and damp, while one or more of these despicable creatures came crawling up their arm, leaving a shiny trail behind them...\nAt the behest of the people of Liyue, Morax agreed to wipe these creatures out. But these parasites upon civilization could not be destroyed like enemies on a battlefield, by simply summoning a storm of stone spears that would shatter the earth and churn the soil....\nStill, he was the God of Contracts. His word had to be his bond.\nSo, he went through the town from house to house with prisons of stone, seizing these creatures one by one and locking them away for good...\nThis long campaign of pest extermination taught Morax the true meaning of \"a burden lifted.\"\nThe grueling campaign itself, and the terrible smell of those ocean creatures' secretions, left a lasting impression on the deity.\nToday, even when he goes out incognito as the mortal man, Zhongli, Morax gives those living, squirming seafood products a wide berth.\n...Well, except for dishes where said seafood products have been sliced and diced into oblivion, such as seafood tofu. He'll quite happily eat those.",
            "Vision\tOnce the Rite of Parting, of which Zhongli was both director and star, was over, the Fatui Harbinger named Signora appeared before him.\nBy prior contract, she was here to claim the Geo Archon Morax's Gnosis.\nBefore the Traveler and the two Fatui Harbingers, Zhongli related the truth that he had established a contract with the Cryo Archon.\nIn his own words, this was his final \"Contract to End All Contracts.\"\nYet no matter how one looks at it, the loss of his divine ability to defend Liyue was too great a price to pay.\nEven amongst mortals, the basis of a contract is \"equivalent exchange.\"\nAnd for the God of Contracts, who must have established countless such agreements in his long years of existence, such an important contract must have come with its benefits.\nNow, the Geo Archon has given away his Gnosis as his part of the deal.\nWhat, then, must the Cryo Archon have wagered to balance the scales?"
